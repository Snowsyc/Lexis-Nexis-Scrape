</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged under a local ordinance for disturbing the peace. Defendant directed a profane barrage of insults at his neighbor while she was in her yard. The people asserted that these insults were overheard by others in the vicinity. Defendant filed a motion in the district court to dismiss the charges, arguing that the ordinance, which prohibited shouting, whistling, loud, boisterous, or vulgar conduct, along with a host of other activities as a means to annoy or disturb the quiet, was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The lower court upheld the district court's dismissal of the charge and finding that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the ordinance, on its face, did not substantially endanger constitutionally protected speech; the ordinance was content-neutral under the reasonable person standard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant township enacted a special assessment, whereby appellee landowners were required to pay for the cost of a water supply system. The Tax Tribunal invalidated the ordinance, holding that the assessment was greater than the value of appellees' land. Appellant then enacted an ordinance, establishing a fee for a connection to the water supply system in the same amount as the original assessment. Appellees brought suit, and the trial court ruled that the ordinance was a subterfuge and an unconstitutional tax. Appellant challenged the judgment, and the court reversed. The court held that the amount charged was a fee and not a tax, because the fee served a regulatory purpose, was proportionate to the necessary costs of the service, and was voluntary. The court determined that appellant had the statutory authority to collect a fee for the water service under the township ordinance act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 41.181; 5.45(1). Finally, the court concluded that the judgment did not invalidate the Tax Tribunal's decision, as appellant had a right to enact a different method financing the water system.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 208.1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In accordance with the decision, which was handed down in 1993, the Department determined that the taxpayer was liable for the single business tax for the fiscal years of 1990 through 1993. Upon review, the court stated that the decision had previously been found to apply retroactively. The Department was not estopped from collecting the past, single business taxes because it never misrepresented facts, and its representation was based on a good-faith understanding of state law. Further, the Department was required by the judiciary to change its position on the taxpayer's immunity from taxation under the SBTA. The court found that retroactive application of the tax did not violate due process simply because the taxable events transpired before the decision was handed down. There was no evidence that the Department's conduct in collecting back SBTA taxes was arbitrary or capricious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant civil service commission appealed an order of the Ingham Circuit Court (Michigan), which granted plaintiff union's motion for an injunction against defendant's imposition of a revised civil service Rule 4-6, as violative of Mich. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5 (1963), and denied defendant's motion for a protective order relative to plaintiffs' request for production.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Holding that plaintiff union had shown a likelihood of success in proving that revised civil service Rule 4-6 was facially unconstitutional to the extent that it authorized decentralized disbursements for personal services, the court affirmed the judgment in part. The court held that Mich. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5 (1963), required the civil service commission to approve or disapprove disbursements for all personal services, and this requirement meant that the proposed decentralization was an unconstitutional delegation of authority. The court held that this finding alone supported the grant of an injunction, which was authorized by art. XI, &sect; 5 itself. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, however, to the extent that it held unconstitutional Rule 4-6's preauthorization procedures, because defendant discharged its constitutional duty to approve or disapprove certain services when it formulated the list of preauthorized services. The court further held that plaintiff had standing to seek relief, because art. XI, &sect; 5 granted standing to any citizen of the state, and as a membership organization comprised of citizens with standing, logic dictated that plaintiff had standing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of a preliminary injunction and remanded. The court affirmed the trial court's holding that, for the purposes of the injunction, plaintiff union had proven that defendant civil service commission's decentralized disbursement procedure was an unconstitutional delegation of authority. The court reversed the judgment to the extent it held that preauthorization of services procedures unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendant presented the affirmative defense that he was carrying the weapon for hunting. Defendant contended that the prosecution failed to present sufficient evidence to disprove this affirmative defense to the charge of carrying a concealed weapon. The court reasoned that the crime, as applied to this case, had only one element, that defendant carried a pistol in a vehicle operated by him. The court held that defendant arguably presented enough evidence to put the affirmative defense of hunting into controversy. However, the court held that the evidence, taken as a whole, was sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant did not satisfy the elements of the hunting exception to the concealed weapons statute. The court held that the police officers testified that defendant did not mention hunting during his discussions with the investigating officer, that the temperature was approximately 18 degrees below zero that morning, and defendant had only cowboy boots with him, and that a conservation officer with the Department of Natural Resources testified that the handgun in question was not a hunting weapon and was designed for personal protection.</SPAN></P>

He alleged that the trial court erred in granting the summary disposition under the Michigan Civil Rights Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 37.2102(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee alleged that he was rejected as a shift supervisor because of the DOC's affirmative action plan and the use of augmented certification. The trial court granted summary judgment. The court affirmed. The court noted that the affirmative action plan was filed with and approved by the Michigan Civil Rights Commission under Michigan Civil Rights Act &sect; 210. With regard to the alleged discrimination, the court held that summary disposition was properly granted under Mich. Ct. R. 2.116(C)(10). The court noted that augmented certification was incorporated into the DOC's plan. According to the court, the employee did not indicate that a particular position existed for which he could apply where the DOC's affirmative action policy applied. Further, the court noted that the employee was not excluded from any applicant pool or selection process when applying for a position for which he was qualified. The court noted that the DOC discontinued its use of augmented certification lists. Thus, the court found that the employee failed to demonstrate a real and immediate threat that he would suffer similar injury in the future and that the relief sought would redress that injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his sentence was excessive but the court found that it was proportionate to the seriousness of the circumstances surrounding the offense. The offense was defendant's fourth sexual offense and it was the second time defendant had had sex in a correctional facility. Defendant argued that his sentence was improperly scored but the court found that, even if it had, that was not a basis for appellate relief. Defendant claimed that the prosecutor failed to bring him to trial within the statutory 180-day period but the court found that, when properly counted, the period between trial and arrest was 168 days. The question of whether sex between the parties, husband and wife, could be considered gross indecency had been previously decided and a subsequent review of the issue was barred, however, a prior administrative punishment of defendant for the sexual conduct did not bar the criminal remedy. Finally, defendant's conviction could not be relieved due to ineffective assistance of counsel due to counsel's failure to present a witness that defendant did not identify.</SPAN></P>

The trial court determined that it did not have jurisdiction to decide the constitutional issue presented in the taxpayer's case. The taxpayer then filed the present action for a judgment declaring &sect; 10 of the act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.10, unconstitutional and asked for a writ of mandamus compelling the city and county to change the 1992 assessment on the subject property to the amount of the 1991 assessment. The trial court granted the city and county summary disposition on res judicata grounds. The taxpayer contended that res judicata could not apply because the trial court's discussion of the act's constitutionality in the first case was dictum. The court held that because the trial court's decision was reached without addressing the constitutional issue, the comments regarding the constitutionality of the act were not essential to the resolution of the case and constituted dictum. The court held that the doctrine of res judicata was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed by right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the jury selection was unconstitutional because blacks were underrepresented in the jury venire, which violated his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community. The court found that the trial court abused its discretion in determining that defendant had not been deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community. Defendant was therefore entitled to a new trial. Defendant further argued that the police improperly secured information from his confidential medical records maintained at a prison where defendant had been incarcerated in the past. Defendant also contended that the one-person grand jury exceeded its statutory authority when it subpoenaed defendant to appear in a lineup, and this unlawful seizure required suppression of the fruits of the lineup. The court ruled that neither the discovery of defendant's identity from the prison nor the one person grand jury's subpoena compelling defendant to appear in a lineup violated the Fourth Amendment. Thus, the evidence gathered as a result of those two events was properly admitted at the first trial.</SPAN></P>

The jury instructions could not exclude consideration of material issues and theories for which there was evidence. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's request for discovery of the personnel files because he did not provide the trial court with any demonstrable facts indicating that there was a reasonable probability that the files were likely to contain material information.

Comp. Laws &sect; 750.267 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.478 et seq.) unconstitutional and under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case arose after a police investigation revealed plaintiffs were involved in fortune telling for compensation. Plaintiff first alleged that the trial court improperly modified the standard jury instruction regarding false imprisonment by adding the word &quot;significantly.&quot; The court found that plaintiffs' false imprisonment claim was based on a Fourth Amendment violation under &sect;1983 and held that absent a showing of physical force or show of authority, an encounter between police and a member of the public was not a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The court concluded the jury instruction was correct. The court reviewed the grant of summary judgment on plaintiffs' selective enforcement claims and determined that they failed to demonstrate that they were prosecuted because they were members of a protected group, there was no indication that the investigation undertaken by defendants was motivated by desire to foreclose the exercise of constitutional rights or purposeful discrimination intended to accomplish a forbidden aim.

Defendant claimed that her constitutional right to confrontation was violated when the trial court denied her the opportunity to offer an alternative explanation for the victim's characteristics of child abuse. However, defendant failed to comply with the rape-shield law by making an initial offer of proof. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in precluding defendant from offering the evidence of the victim's other sexual contact.

They were both arrested and convicted of several offenses. Both defendants appealed. The court affirmed the first defendant's convictions but found that he was entitled to resentencing because his 40 to 60 month sentence for felonious assault exceeded the maximum sentence allowed by statute. Moreover, because the maximum sentence for felonious assault was 48 months, the first defendant's minimum sentence of 40 months was excessive because it exceeded two-thirds of the maximum. The court affirmed the second defendant's convictions and sentence. The court held that: (1) there was no clear error in the trial court's determination that the second defendant's statement to police was voluntary; (2) the instruction correctly conveyed the meaning of reasonable doubt to the jury; and (3) while the second defendant alleged numerous errors on appeal, many of the allegations were meritless and the remainder of the alleged errors were harmless, therefore, the court concluded that cumulative errors did not deny the second defendant a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff appealed and the court reversed, holding that defendant had transacted business in the state pursuant to the long-arm statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.715. After determining that the long-arm statute applied, the court determined that due process allowed the exercise of limited personal jurisdiction over defendant based on a three part minimum contacts analysis. The court noted that defendant purposely availed itself of the privilege of doing business in the state, that the cause of action arose from that business, and that the exercise of jurisdiction was reasonable. A regulation implementing the securities statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 451.801(n), defined commodity to include gemstone, so the statute applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the grant of summary disposition to defendant foreign corporation because the state court had personal jurisdiction over defendant under its long-arm statute and the exercise of that jurisdiction complied with due process requirements. Defendant availed itself of the privilege of doing business in the forum state and the cause of action arose from that specific business.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review after the Jackson Circuit Court (Michigan) convicted him of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 750.520b(1)(a), and sentenced him as a habitual offender, fourth offense, pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 769.12, to a term of 15 to 25 years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was prosecuted under the definition of &quot;sexual penetration&quot; that proscribed any other intrusion of any part of a person's body. The trial court convicted defendant. On appeal, he contended that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 750.520b(1)(a) was unconstitutional as applied to him because he allegedly penetrated the victim's genitals for a legitimate purpose, without sexual intent. The court affirmed. The facts clearly demonstrated that defendant had no authorization or valid purpose for penetrating the victim's genitals; therefore, his challenge to the statute's constitutionality by analogy to hypothetical situations unrelated to the present facts was unpersuasive. Defendant also failed to prove that he had been denied the effective assistance of counsel at trial. Defendant had failed to demonstrate that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms or that there was a reasonable probability that, but for the alleged errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different. Given defendant's extensive prior criminal record, and his fourth-offense habitual offender status, defendant's sentence was proportionate.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the clear and unambiguous language of the statute included defendant's intentional touching of the chest area of a prepubescent girl who did not have fully developed breasts. The evidence was sufficient to enable a rational trier of fact to find that each of the elements of criminal sexual conduct had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. There was also sufficient evidence from which the jury might have inferred that the intentional touching could reasonably have been construed as being for sexual arousal or gratification. The court concluded that the trial court's general instruction on unanimity was sufficient. The criminal sexual conduct statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it provided a structure to guide the jury's determination of the purpose of the contact, nor did it impermissibly shift the burden of proof to defendant. Evidence of defendant's prior bad acts was admissible to show intent under Mich. R. Evid. 404(b)(1).</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court correctly determined that the husband's inheritance was part of the marital estate because those funds had been combined with other funds that were clearly part of the marital estate. The trial court also did not err in including the home in the marital estate because it had not simply been given to the husband by his mother. Instead, it had been purchased with funds from the marital estate. The trial court correctly awarded alimony to the wife given her health and earning capacity and the husband's failure to prove that he was unable to pay the alimony. The Michigan no-fault divorce statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 552.6, did not infringe on the husband's right to marry, and the court concluded that it was not the appropriate forum to consider whether the statute contradicted sound policy. The statute did not violate the husband's right to freely exercise his religious beliefs because the parties' ecclesiastical union was not affected by the dissolution of their civil union.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 37.1101 et seq. and 37.2101 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a condition of his employment, plaintiff employee, who suffered from epilepsy and cognitive defects, signed an agreement to arbitrate all employment-related disputes with defendant employers. After he quit his job, plaintiff sued defendants for, inter alia, disability and racial discrimination, under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 37.1101 et seq. and 37.2101 et seq. Defendants were granted summary judgment based on the arbitration agreement. Plaintiff appealed. Although it believed the agreement was valid, a panel of the appellate court reversed pursuant to a decision of another panel that such agreements were per se violative of public policy. The court invoked the conflicts panel provision of Mich. Ct. R. 7.215(H) and vacated the original panel decision. A special conflicts panel held that predispute agreements to arbitrate employment discrimination claims were enforceable and not violative of public policy, so long as no substantive statutory rights or remedies were waived by the employee and arbitration procedures were fair.

In reversing the decision and finding the ordinances valid, the court held that defendant's authority to enact its ordinance was not proscribed by law, and thus did not violate the home rule act. Defendant's aesthetic concerns and other interests were reasonable governmental interests and sufficient to justify the billboard regulations. The court also found that plaintiff had failed to sustain its burden of proving a demonstrated need for the land use.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Recorder's Court (Michigan), which convicted defendant of fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.520e(1)(a), and indecent exposure, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.335a. Defendant was sentenced to two years' probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's primary contention was that the victim was not a credible witness. The court had consistently held that credibility issues regarding witness testimony were to be resolved by the trier of fact, not the reviewing court. The trial court saw and heard the witnesses and was in the best position to determine the weight such testimony should be accorded. The trial court spoke at great length about its credibility considerations. Upon review of the evidence presented in the trial court, the court held that there was no miscarriage of justice, the conviction verdicts were reasonably supported, and the evidence did not clearly weigh in defendant's favor. Further, defendant's claim was without merit because whether defendant's conduct could be reasonably construed as being for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification was, itself, an element of the offense. Defendant's conduct of forcibly placing his hands on the victim's breasts and forcing her hand to touch his exposed and erect penis was most assuredly conduct within the contemplation of, and prohibited by, the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

They asked him to step out of the vehicle, told him he was under arrest for making excessive noise, and upon searching him, found that he was carrying a handgun. Defendant argued that he was improperly bound over and that his motion to suppress the gun should have been granted because it was found as the product of an unlawful search. The court affirmed the judgment. Defendant was properly arrested for violation of the city's noise ordinance, Kalamazoo, Mich., Code &sect; 21-6. It did not specify a measured noise level, and its violation was a misdemeanor under Kalamazoo, Mich., Code &sect; 1-7. The police officers were entitled to arrest defendant without a warrant because they witnessed his commission of the misdemeanor of violating the noise ordinance. The officer had probable cause for the arrest and the gun was found in a search incident to a lawful arrest. Defendant waived his argument that the stop was pretextual and unconstitutional by failing to cite authority to support his position, but the finding of probable cause made the assertion meritless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The language of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 772.1 et seq. provided fair notice that the conduct the peace bond statute was concerned with was threatening to commit an offense against the person or property of another and was not unconstitutionally vague. Further, the peace bond statutes were not unconstitutional in failing to distinguish between executive duties to bring charges and judicial duties to hear charges because the involvement of the prosecutor's office or appointment of counsel was not necessarily required. The district court's authority to require security to keep the peace was distinct from the performance of the judge's ordinary judicial function and acting within the peace bond statute did not exceed the judge's jurisdiction and discretion. The lower court abused its discretion in issuing an order of superintending control because plaintiffs failed to offer any evidence that defendant judge followed any general policy inconsistent with the peace bond statutes. Therefore the decision of the lower court was reversed, although it was not an abuse of discretion to refuse to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of improper service.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of superintendence of the lower court preventing defendant court from issuing peace bonds was reversed and remanded because the peace bond statutes were not unconstitutional and the order should not have been issued where there was no evidence that defendant court followed any general policy inconsistent with the peace bond statutes.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed his blood sample was unconstitutionally obtained, he was denied effective assistance of counsel, and the trial court erred in allowing the victim's mother and a police officer to recount statements made by the victim describing the assault. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that the search warrant was broad enough to cover blood samples pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 780.652. The court ruled that there was no reasonable probability that differing conduct by defense counsel would have changed the decision on the suppression motion or the outcome of the case. The court held that defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to move for dismissal on the ground of the 180-day rule because the prosecutor proceeded promptly toward readying the case for trial. The court ruled that the statements made by the victim were admissible under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, developers of a subdivision, appealed a decision of the Jackson Circuit Court (Michigan) that denied their application for a writ of mandamus to compel defendant township supervisor to commence proceedings in accordance with the private roads act to determine the necessity of an easement across private property and to determine just compensation to the affected landowner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought to develop a landlocked parcel of land and requested defendant township supervisor, pursuant to the private roads act, to impanel a jury to address the issues of the necessity of an easement across private property and just compensation to the affected landowner. When defendant declined to proceed, plaintiffs filed suit seeking a writ of mandamus to compel defendant to commence proceedings. The court denied plaintiffs' request, holding that the private roads act violated Mich. Const. art. X, &sect; 2. On appeal, a panel of the court reversed based on a precedentially binding decision but declared a conflict pursuant to Mich. Ct. R. 7.215(H). A special panel was convened to resolve the conflict. The panel observed that legislation was clothed in a presumption of constitutionality absent a clear showing to the contrary. The panel found that the private roads act was constitutional because it did not derive from the eminent domain power since the property was not taken for a public use. Rather, it emanated from the police power to reasonably regulate the use of property. The court therefore reversed and remanded the case for the issuance of the writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The special panel of the court upheld the constitutionality of the private roads act, reversed the judgment of the trial court, and remanded the case to the trial court for the issuance of a writ of mandamus ordering defendant to convene a jury to determine the necessity of an easement across private property and just compensation to the affected landowner.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found the trial court did not abuse its discretion by rejecting defendant's Batson objection to the prosecution's use of a peremptory challenge where defendant failed to show a pattern of strikes against black jurors. The court also noted at least one black person ultimately sat on defendant's jury and the prosecution's stated nondiscriminatory reasons for the peremptory challenge were reasonable and entirely plausible. The court held the admission of the victim's account of the rape through a police officer was proper under Mich. R. Evid. 803(24) and 804(b)(6) catchall or residual hearsay exceptions even though the offense occurred two years prior to hearsay exceptions taking effect where constitutional ex post facto guarantees were not violated. The court reasoned that the evidentiary rules in question merely allowed the admission of testimony that carried with it circumstantial evidence of reliability and the rules did not deprive defendant of a defense or substantial disadvantage defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court also found sufficient evidence that defendant constructively possessed the cocaine found in his home.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought review of a decision from the Wayne Circuit Court (Michigan), which granted summary judgment to defendants on plaintiffs' action alleging a number of causes including contract and state constitutional claims arising out of defendants' handling of plaintiffs' relative's deceased body. Plaintiffs also challenged the trial court's denial of its motion to file a second amended complaint adding federal claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case arose after plaintiffs' relative's deceased body was found to have become badly decomposed while in the care of defendant county hospital morgue and others. Plaintiffs filed an action against defendants, and the trial court granted summary disposition for defendant county with respect to all elements of the case on the ground of governmental immunity. Plaintiffs appealed on the grounds that both the statutory public hospital and common-law exceptions to governmental immunity applied to their claim against defendant county. Plaintiffs also argued that the trial court should have permitted them to file a second amended complaint to assert a claim for violating U.S. Const. amend. XIV. On review, the court affirmed with respect to the trial court's grant of governmental immunity, finding that the exception granted for claims alleging mutilation of a dead body was not broad enough to encompass plaintiffs' decomposition claim. The court also held that the Michigan Constitution did not recognize a property right in a deceased body. However, the court reversed and remanded to permit the filing of a second amended complaint asserting a federal constitutional claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's grant of summary judgment for defendant county with respect to plaintiffs' state law claims was affirmed, but the trial court's denial of plaintiffs' motion to file a second amended complaint to assert a claim for violation of plaintiffs' due process rights under the U.S. Constitution was reversed and remanded because the court found that plaintiffs could have presented a cognizable claim in an amended complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant newspaper company challenged an order of the Washtenaw County Circuit Court (Michigan) that denied appellant's post-verdict motion to access the names and addresses of the jurors who had served in a high-profile serial rape case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried and convicted of felony murder and three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. Because of the high profile nature of the case, the trial court took measures to protect the jurors' identities. Jurors were identified only by number, not by name. Jurors were sequestered during the trial. During the trial, the court prohibited any person from disseminating to the public the names or addresses of the jurors or prospective jurors and declared that any attempt by anyone to communicate with a member of the jury panel would be considered criminal contempt of court. After the trial was completed, appellant newspaper company sought the identities of the jurors. The court consulted with the jurors. Because they expressed concern for their safety as well as that of their families, the trial court denied appellant's motion, and appellant took exception. On appeal, the court noted that this was a case of first impression and held that appellant had a qualified post-verdict right to access to juror names. Because the trial court failed to identify on the record why appellant's motion should not have been granted, a remand was necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case to the trial court because appellant newspaper company had a qualified right to access juror information. A hearing was necessary to determine whether appellant was entitled to access the juror information it sought because the trial court had not established a basis for its denial of appellant's original request.</SPAN></P>

The trial court refused to sentence defendant in conjunction with the plea agreement. It was clear from the record that the prosecutor was ready and willing to follow through on the parties' plea agreement. The court also found that defense counsel made a reasonable attempt to introduce evidence of the victim's previous allegations of sexual abuse. Therefore, defendant was unable to overcome the presumption that he received effective assistance of counsel. The court also affirmed defendant's sentence because there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's decision to score the offense variable based on penetration.</SPAN></P>

However, defendant was found guilty of the charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm and for being a fourth habitual offender. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court held that there was no violation of the double jeopardy clause because defendant elected to have the offenses tried separately. The issue of defendant's possession of a firearm was not resolved by the first jury so the State was not barred under principles of collateral estoppel from trying the second case. The court ruled that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.224f (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.421(6)) did not violate defendant's constitutional right to bear arms. The court held that defendant's conviction did not violate the ex post facto clause. The court ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant.</SPAN></P>

The city commission denied the owner's rezoning request and the owner filed an action that challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance. The court affirmed the circuit court's decision that granted summary judgment in favor of the City pursuant to Mich. Ct. R. 2.116(C)(10) because the owner failed to apply to the board of zoning appeals for a use variance. A challenge to the validity of a zoning ordinance &quot;as applied&quot; was subject to the rule of finality. Richmond, Mich. Ordinance art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City notified the owner that he was in violation of &sect; 1413.2 which prohibited the owner from keeping more than one recreation vehicle on his property. The owner brought an action that challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance. The court affirmed the circuit court's order that dismissed the owner's action. The ordinance was not violative of due process because it was not enacted primarily for aesthetic purposes. The owner failed to demonstrate that there was no reasonable governmental interest that was being advanced by the ordinance. Even though aesthetics may not have been the sole basis for a zoning ordinance, an ordinance that was rationally related to other legitimate governmental interests which only incidentally improved aesthetic conditions was not invalid. The ordinance legitimately furthered the interests of public health and safety by providing unobstructed vision for pedestrians and motorists. The ordinance did not violate equal protection on the ground that it treated individuals with recreational vehicles differently from those who did not have them because the ordinance was rationally related to a legitimate government interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner commenced an action in the trial court seeking to require the owner to operate his cemetery in accordance with the Cemetery Regulation Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 456.521 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21 820(21) et seq.). The complaint resulted in a temporary restraining order and later a permanent injunction. An agent executing a search warrant seized 53 contracts that had been entered into by the owner after the issuance of the preliminary and permanent injunctions. The owner was held in criminal contempt, sentenced, and fined. The owner appealed and argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to adjourn, that he was not provided with adequate notice that he could be fined for each contract, and that the trial court erred in &quot;stacking&quot; each violation. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to adjourn. The court ruled that the owner was given adequate notice at least for the undercover operation. However, it found that the trial court improperly &quot;stacked&quot; each finding of criminal contempt so that the owner was fined a certain sum for each contract in violation of the injunctions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By leave granted, appellant, the state liquor control commission, appealed a temporary restraining order (TRO) issued by the Ingham Circuit Court, the denial of the commission's motions for summary disposition, and granting of the motion for summary disposition filed by appellees, state liquor employees. The appellate court dissolved the TRO and stayed any further trial court proceedings, pending disposition of the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that although the commission violated &sect;&sect; 45, 46 (Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 24.245, 24.246) of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 24.201 et seq., in adopting the proposed rule for privatization of liquor stores, those sections of the APA were unconstitutional under the Michigan Constitution, articles 3 and 4, Mich. Const. art. 3, 4. The appellate court rejected the employees' suggestion that the entire APA had to be discarded in light of the unconstitutionality of &sect;&sect; 45, 46 (Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 24.245, 24. 246). Because procedural protections still existed within the APA, including legislative veto power, even in the absence of &sect;&sect; 45, 46, the remainder of the APA remained enforceable. The Liquor Control Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 436.1 et seq., while contemplating that the commission may promulgate rules governing authorized distribution agent qualification (ADA) and selection, did not mandate that the commission promulgate rules before it could begin implementing its privatization plan by ADA selection. New rules were not required by the amendments (1996 Mich. Pub. Acts 440) to the Liquor Control Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 436.1 et seq.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statutorily enacted fees were presumed reasonable, but could have been found constitutionally infirm, if they bore no reasonable relationship to the expense for which they were chargeable. The court held that the infirmity had to appear on the face of the statute or be established by proper evidence. The court held that plaintiffs failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality. The court held that the evidence was insufficient to show that the fee amount was out of proportion to the expense involved. The court held that the fact that some counties, by virtue of the large number of documents they processed, operated more efficiently than other counties did not make the legislatively mandated fee unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Ingham Circuit Court (Michigan) found defendant social service agencies' policy regarding state disability assistance (SDA) eligibility invalid because it constituted a rule that should have been promulgated under the Administrative Procedures Act, Mich.

The social service agencies challenged the standard for considering applications for SDA program benefits and appealed the order granting supplemental relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Michigan provided welfare benefits under a general assistance program administered by the department of social services (DSS) from 1979 until fiscal year 1991-92. The legislature eliminated the program in 1991 by not appropriating funds for the program in the DSS budget. The legislature established the SDA program to provide assistance to some former program recipients. Plaintiff former recipients of assistance brought an action seeking certification of a class action and declaratory and injunctive relief. The social service agencies and the former recipients filed cross-motions for summary disposition of the claims. The trial court granted partial summary disposition for former recipients declaring social service agencies' policy invalid and violative of the Administrative Procedures Act and the SDA appropriations acts. The former recipients sought postjudgment supplemental relief. The trial court subsequently fashioned a remedy. The court held that the policy regarding SDA eligibility was an interpretive statement that need not have been promulgated as a rule under the APA and that the social service agencies correctly construed the language of the Appropriations Acts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant potential father challenged the order of the Wayne Circuit Court (Michigan), which denied rehearing of an order that granted plaintiff mother's motion for modification of child support after the circuit court entered orders in mother's paternity action based on the parties' settlement that potential father would pay support and that such obligation was not modifiable pursuant to Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the settlement of mother's paternity action, the parties agreed that potential father would pay weekly child support but that potential father would not acknowledge paternity. The court held that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 722.713 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 25.493) denied children born outside marriage their U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2 right of equal protection. The court held that (1) &sect; 722.713 denied the right of modification of support orders for children born out of wedlock who were not the subject of a filiation order, although a right to modification was expressly granted to other children. (2) No &quot;substantially related&quot; state interest existed that would sustain the classification contained in &sect; 722.713. (3) The disparate treatment of children born outside marriage in &sect; 722.713 could not withstand heightened scrutiny. (4) Because of scientific advances in DNA and blood tests, there was no longer a difference between the state's interest in finality and settlement in paternity actions and divorce actions based on the difficulty of proof. And (5) children born outside marriage were no less deserving of support because of the circumstances of their birth.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the motion and the landfill operators appealed. On review, the court affirmed and held that the difference between a tax and a fee was that a fee was exchanged for a service rendered or a benefit conferred, and some reasonable relationship existed between the amount of the fee and the value of the service or benefit. The court held that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 46.11, Mich. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent parole board appealed an order from the Wayne Circuit Court (Michigan) that declared Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 791.235(6)&nbsp;unconstitutional, construed &sect; 791.206(2) and Mich. Admin. Code r. 791.7765 (1996) as requiring that all three of its members meet in discussion prior to making a decision, and held that it was required by Mich. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the parole board argued that: (1) the trial court erred when it concluded that the statutory preclusion of attorneys from parole interviews found in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 791.235(6) violated the Equal Protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions; and (2) the trial court erred when it ruled that the parole board violated Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 791.206 and Mich. Admin. Code r. 791.7765 (1996) by permitting two members of a three-member board to decide petitioner's eligibility for parole. Upon review, the appellate court concluded that the trial court erred when it held that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 791.235 was unconstitutional. The statutory provision, being rationally related to legitimate governmental purposes, was not violative of equal protection. In addition, the appellate court held that because nothing in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 791.206 and Mich. Admin. Code r. 791.7765 (1996) prohibited it, the parole board could continue to engage in the practice of allowing two members of a three-member parole board panel, if they agreed on the release, revocation, and/or rescission decision, to decide a petitioner's eligibility for parole.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree premeditated murder under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.316(1)(a) (Mich.

Laws &sect; 750.529 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.797). The felony murder count was vacated, and defendant appealed the remaining convictions. The court affirmed. The court found that the trial court had not erred when it refused to suppress the state's evidence of two statements made by defendant while he was in custody. The court said that, although there had been no probable cause to have arrested defendant as of the time he made the first statement, its admission was harmless error because the police had gathered enough information by the time defendant made the second statement to have had probable cause for his arrest. The court found no prosecutorial misconduct that would have justified vacating the convictions because no miscarriage of justice resulted from casual references to defendant's prior convictions made by witnesses. The court also found that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the convictions.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the evidence was offered to show that defendant intentionally failed to disclose his HIV status as part of a scheme, plan, or system in doing an act, that this evidence was relevant, and that the probative value of the evidence did not substantially outweighed its potential for unfair prejudice. The court further found no evidence of prosecutorial misconduct. First, defendant failed to object to the alleged improper cross-examination at trial and they merely attempted to point out inconsistencies in the defense theory of the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Michigan Supreme Court upheld defendant's convictions and the constitutionality of the HIV-notice statute. The court rejected defendant's contention that the statute was unconstitutional because it was overbroad and lacked an explicit mens rea requirement. Defendant failed to show how the statute's breadth was improper and her behavior fell squarely within the statute's contemplation. Although the statute had no explicit mens rea requirement, the requisite intent was inherent in the HIV-infected person's socially and morally irresponsible actions. The court also rejected defendant's claims that the statute violated her privacy rights and her First Amendment right against compelled speech, finding these rights were outweighed by the state's compelling interest in protecting its citizens against the spread of a fatal disease.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with criminal sexual conduct involving his former wife's daughters. The Livingston Circuit Court (Michigan) denied defendant's motion in limine to introduce evidence that the mother's former live-in boyfriend sexually abused the girls, ruling that the proffered evidence was inadmissible under the rape-shield statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.520j (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.788(10)). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ruled that the proffered evidence was required to be excluded under the rape-shield statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.520j (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.788(10)). Defendant offered two reasons to introduce evidence that the former boyfriend previously pleaded guilty to similar charges: (1) to show that the girls' age-inappropriate sexual knowledge was not learned from defendant, and (2) to show that the girls had a motive to make false charges against defendant. Defendant contended that the exclusion of the evidence would violate his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation as well as his right to present a defense. The court concluded that the trial court could use its discretion to admit such evidence after adhering to certain safeguards. Upon review of the record, the court determined that the trial court did not perform the steps required in order to protect the interest of the children and of defendant. The court held that the trial court was required to hold an in-camera hearing to determine whether defendant's proffered evidence should have been admitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker sustained a work-related injury while employed by the employer. He was awarded total and permanent disability benefits. Because he remained disabled after the expiration of the statutory 800-week period of presumed disability, he continued to receive benefits from both the employer and the fund. When the worker reached the age of 65, the fund reduced his benefits to 25 percent of the state's average weekly wage, and further reduced his benefits to recoup the overpayment of benefits in the previous 12 months. The worker did not challenge these reductions. However, he filed an application seeking reinstatement of the reduced benefits under Wozniak v. General Motors Corp. The court affirmed the modification of the worker's award. Under Wozniak, the minimum-benefit provision of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.351(2); Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.237(351)(2) was not affected by the age 65 reduction. Further, Wozniak applied retroactively because legislative intent was not to reduce benefits for these workers below the minimum level, the fund's reliance on a prior decision was misplaced, and retroactive application would further the administration of justice.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 478.7(4); Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22.565(1)(4) in excess of the amount allowed by federal law, specifically the single-state registration system (SSRS).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The federal law governing the amount of fees to be charged by a state as part of its licensing and registration system, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 11506(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III), essentially froze the amount a state could charge at the fee it charged or collected as of November 15, 1991. The state changed its reciprocity arrangement with other states during 1991, and for 1992, the carrier was required to pay a fee for a large number of additional vehicles previously exempt under the old reciprocity agreements. The carrier paid the 1992 fee prior to November 15, 1991, and brought the instant action alleging that the state had improperly charged the carrier for the additional vehicles, because the carrier had not paid for those vehicles in 1991, and &sect; 11506(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III) had frozen the charges at the 1991 amount. The trial court granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, and the court affirmed, finding that the fees were fixed at the level in effect for the 1991 year, and the carrier's payment prior to the deadline date did not affect the determination of the applicable fee. The court ordered the state to reimburse the carrier for the overpayment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city sought review of an order of the Detroit Recorder's Court (Michigan), which affirmed a municipal court's order dismissing charges against defendant dancers for violation of the city's disorderly conduct ordinance, Detroit, Mich., City Code &sect; 38-5-1. The city contended that the recorder's court erred when it found that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges of disorderly conduct against defendants arose from their performance of lap dances for customers of an adult entertainment facility. The ordinance prohibited indecent or obscene conduct in a public place. The charges were dismissed when the trial court found that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague, as it failed to provide adequate notice of the proscribed conduct. On appeal, the court reversed. Reviewing the ordinance's constitutionality de novo, the court found that the language &quot;indecent or obscene conduct&quot; had been judicially construed in criminal cases; therefore the meaning of the terms could be fairly ascertained and defendants were on notice what the terms meant. Further, defendants were on notice that the court had held that lap dancing, when done for the purpose of masturbation, was prohibited lewd conduct. Because the charges did allege that the lap dancing was done specifically for the purpose of masturbation, defendants had fair warning that lap dancing was criminally prohibited. Because defendants' conduct was clearly within the contemplation of the ordinance, they did not have standing to bring an overbreadth challenge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the recorder's court determination that the city's disorderly conduct ordinance was unconstitutional, and remanded the case for reinstatement of the charges against defendants.</SPAN></P>

On February 4, 1997, the prosecution filed its application for leave to appeal. That application was denied. The prosecution filed an appeal of that denial. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that the prosecution waited for over one year after the district court dismissed the charges before it filed an application for leave to appeal and that the problems surrounding the transcript did not excuse the delay.

The court of appeals disagreed. There was no indication in the record that defendant asked the trial court to inquire into the security procedures at the prison in order to impeach another inmate's testimony. Furthermore, the trial court did not err by failing to find that the inmate lied about who initiated the first contact regarding defendant's plan to kill a judge. The trial court heard audio recordings of conversations between the inmate and defendant's first attorney, in which the inmate claimed that prison authorities initiated the investigation, as well as the inmate's contradictory testimony that he initiated the contact and that he lied to defendant's attorney to protect himself from defendant. The trial court also heard testimony from the undercover officer and the recorded conversation between defendant and the undercover officer. The deputy warden also testified that the inmate contacted him, and the inmate's note to the warden was entered into evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction for discharging a firearm at a dwelling because he had fired over the house and not hit it, that the statute was unconstitutionality vague, that the prosecutor incorrectly told the jury that felonious assault was a more serious offense than the discharge offense, and that the use of defendant's prior conviction to both prove the possession of a firearm by a felon charge and to enhance the maximum sentence for that offense constituted double jeopardy. The appellate court held that the ordinary meaning of the word &quot;at,&quot; as shown by reference to dictionaries, included &quot;toward&quot; or &quot;in the direction of.&quot; The evidence therefore supported the conviction, and the statute was not impermissibly vague. Defendant did not object to the prosecutor's statement and, as a curative instruction could have corrected any error, defendant's claim that a miscarriage of justice had occurred would not be reviewed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the trial court (Michigan), which convicted defendant of armed robbery, pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.529 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.797), assault with intent to rob while armed, pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.89 (Mich. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's verdict convicting the defendant. First, the court rejected the defendant's argument that his waiver of the constitutional right to a jury trial was involuntary because it was based on defense counsel's representation to him that if he proceeded with a jury trial, he would receive a harsher sentence. The court held that there was no indication that had defendant opted for a jury trial, he would have faced &quot;retaliatory sentencing,&quot; or that the practice needlessly encouraged the waiver of the right to a trial by jury. Next, the court rejected the defendant's argument that the prosecutor impermissibly shifted the burden of proof during closing arguments by stating that a failure of a defense witness to appear at trial was &quot;convenient,&quot; because the defendant failed to object to the comment at trial and because the prosecutor was merely attacking the weaknesses in defendant's version of what occurred. Lastly, the court held that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the trial court's verdict based on, for example, the evidence that defendant matched the general description of the suspect, and that he was identified by witnesses.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the language of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 800.281(4) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.1621(4)) was clear and unambiguous. It was undisputed that the prosecutor proved both elements of the crime. First, the prosecutor proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was in fact a prisoner.

The court held that the word &quot;knowingly&quot; was absolutely absent from &sect; 800.281(4), (&sect; 28.1621(4)) and that the legislature intended for defendant's crime to be a strict liability crime.

The court held that the board members had standing because the executive orders caused diminution in the board members' collective influence and official power. The court found that the State Board of Education (board) was part of the executive branch of government and that to hold that the board was a fourth branch of government would directly contravene the plain meaning of Mich. Const. art. III, &sect; 2. The court found that the executive orders only addressed the powers and duties that were conferred upon the board by statute and did not transfer constitutionally granted functions from one executive branch entity to another. The court found that Mich. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3, did not state that the board was to be the head of the Department of Education.

The court held that an actual act of prostitution occurred when one prostitute agreed to perform fellatio for money and, in preparing to do so, actually initiated physical contact with the officer's private areas. It was irrelevant that the act was not completed. The actual currency received by defendant on the night in question was the proceeds or earnings of the prostitutes because it was defendant's share of the money for time spent with customers. Because the prostitutes were engaged in such profession before their encounter with the officer, defendant should not have been convicted of violating Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.455 (Mich. Stat.

On appeal, the court affirmed. The city had not violated the vendor's due process rights because he lost any property right in his license when he allowed it to expire. There was no error in the decision that the city code provisions that regulated fireworks were not unconstitutional because they bore a reasonable relation to a legitimate government purpose. The court declined to revisit the issue of the constitutionality of state fireworks law and agreed with the trial court that Mich. Comp.

The court affirmed the trial court's injunction. It held that the trial court misjudged the strength of the union's demonstration that it was likely to prevail on the merits of its claim that the emergency rules were substantively invalid. However, the trial court did not err in determining that the union was likely to prevail on its claim that the emergency rules were procedurally invalid. The secretary's emergency rules were procedurally invalid because the secretary's finding did not meet the statutory threshold imposed by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile offender, sought review of a judgment from the trial court (Michigan), which convicted him of first-degree felony-murder, armed robbery, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. Defendant was sentenced as an adult to concurrent prison terms of mandatory life for the first-degree murder conviction, 10 to 20 years for the armed robbery conviction, and a two year term for the felony firearm conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that his confession was not voluntarily made and was inadmissible at trial. Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence armed robbery, his sentence as an adult of life imprisonment and his duel convictions for felony-murder and the underlying felony of armed robbery. Upon review, the court considered the totality of the circumstances and concluded that defendant's confession was voluntary because he read and understood his rights, he had previously faced delinquency charges, and the entire process from arrival at the police station to completion of his statement took less than two hours. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to find that defendant committed the armed robbery. Defendant did not have a constitutional right to have his crimes dealt with by the juvenile justice system, and it was not cruel and unusual punishment to sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole because of the seriousness of murder. The court found that defendant's duel convictions for felony-murder and armed robbery did violate the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners appealed the decision of the trial court (Michigan), which found in favor of defendant town supervisor in the property owners' action requesting a writ of mandamus compelling the town supervisor to comply with his duties under the Opening of Private Roads and Temporary Highways Act, Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners filed a mandamus action against the town supervisor arising out of attempts to obtain approval for the opening of a private road. The court entered judgment in favor of the town supervisor, holding that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 229.1 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9.281 et seq.) was unconstitutional. The property owners appealed. On appeal, the court held that although it agreed with the trial court that &sect; 229.1 et seq. (&sect; 9.281 et seq.) was unconstitutional because it allowed for the taking of private property for the benefit of a private landowner in violation of Mich. Const. art. 10, &sect; 2 (1963), it was bound by earlier precedent that held that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 229.1 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9.281 et seq.) was constitutional. The court found that &sect; 229.1 et seq. (&sect; 9.281 et seq.) did not violate the property owners' due process rights because it complied with the rudimentary requirements of due process. The trial court erred by not issuing the writ of mandamus to the town supervisor because he had a clear duty, nothing was left to his discretion, and there was no legal or equitable remedy that would achieve the same result.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court denying the property owners' request for a writ of mandamus and remanded the case for the trial court to issue a writ of mandamus ordering the town supervisor to convene a jury under the Opening of Private Roads and Temporary Highways Act.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 211.8(g) (Mich. Stat.

The daughter cross-appealed an order requiring the father to make support payments from the time she filed her complaint until she reached 19 1/2 under the Paternity Act (Act), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 722.714.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughter's mother claimed that the father was the daughter's father and commenced a paternity action against him one year after the daughter was born. The trial court ruled that the father was not the daughter's father, but no final order was entered. After the daughter turned 18, she commenced an action to establish the father's paternity and to seek support. The trial court granted summary disposition to the father on the daughter's claims under the Act but denied summary disposition as to the common-law claims. The court affirmed and reversed in part. The court affirmed the dismissal of the daughter's claim under the Act because the Act did not afford an illegitimate child the same rights as a legitimate child after age 18 and affirmed the denial of the father's motion on the common law claims because a common law right existed for an illegitimate child over age 18 to bring an action for support as limited by the disability tolling provision of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.5851(1). However, the court held that if a cause of action for paternity under the common law was preserved by &sect; 600.5851(1), it must be assumed that support from the time a child was born could be sought.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary disposition to the father on the daughter's claims under the Act, affirmed the denial of summary disposition on the daughter's common law claims for support, and reversed the trial court's determination that damages could not be sought from the time the daughter was born.</SPAN></P>

The men drove away but returned to the bank when they decided that more money could be stolen. Police were alerted. The men fled, but were later arrested. After a joint trial in which the accomplice testified against defendants under a plea agreement with the State, defendants were convicted. The court affirmed the convictions, holding that (1) a defendant could not argue on appeal that evidence of an accomplice's plea bargain was prejudicial after he attempted to use that information to undermine the accomplice's credibility at trial; (2) a defendant was not entitled to a separate trial because his counsel stipulated to consolidation and he did not show that his substantial rights would be prejudiced by mutually exclusive or irreconcilable defenses asserted by other defendants; (3) the trial court did not abuse its discretion under Mich. R. Evid. 702 by admitting a detective's qualified expert testimony about tool-mark identification ; and (4) a detective had a reasonable suspicion of ongoing criminal activity, and his investigatory stop was not an unconstitutional search and seizure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property was a retirement housing complex for senior citizens. Petitioner argued that the Tribunal's conclusions concerning market rent were not supported by competent, material and substantial evidence. Specifically, petitioner argued that the market rent utilized by the Tribunal was greater than any comparable rent described or expressed in the record. However, the determination was supported by competent, material and substantial evidence. Petitioner next contended that the Tribunal erred by failing to fully account for the expenses associated with its leased land. The court remanded the case for consideration of the extent to which petitioner's payment of real estate taxes may affect the valuation of the property. Petitioner argued the income from the rentals was excludable because only the fee simple interest in the property was subject to assessment, petitioner's fee simple interest consisted of the right to use and enjoy the property, which petitioner conveyed to the residents of the complex, and the reversionary rights remaining with petitioner. The tribunal's decision was consistent with applicable law and valuation principles and supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court vacated defendant's sentences for the assault conviction and for the first-degree convictions and sentenced defendant as a habitual offender, second offense to 15 to 30 years' imprisonment. The court disagreed with defendant's argument that his assault and sexual conduct convictions must be reversed on the ground that he was denied effective assistance of counsel when defendant's trial counsel failed to object to testimony from the police officers regarding the victim's on-scene identification of defendant. In challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, defendant contended that there was insufficient evidence of a sexual penetration, because there was no showing that defendant penetrated the victim with a sexual purpose. The court found that the crime did not require the sexual penetration to have as its purpose sexual gratification or stimulation. Defendant also contended there was insufficient evidence of the element of force or coercion. The court found, however, that a rational trier of fact could infer, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant accomplished the sexual penetration by overcoming the victim through the actual application of force or violence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the concealed weapons statute as unconstitutionally vague and overbroad because it did not define &quot;a double-edged nonfolding stabbing instrument.&quot; Defendant did not deny that he had two double-edged knives in his possession, but presented evidence that they were designed for throwing, not stabbing. On appeal, the court noted that a statute was presumed to be constitutional unless its unconstitutionality was clearly apparent. The court held that the statute satisfied the void-for-vagueness doctrine, which required a penal statute to define a criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people could understand what conduct was prohibited and in a manner that did not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, in that the phrase &quot;double-edged nonfolding stabbing instrument of any length&quot; contained words with common and generally accepted meanings that ordinary people could understand. However, the court found that a jury instruction impliedly assumed that the knives in question were such instruments, an element that the prosecution had to prove, and deprived defendant of a chance for the jury to consider his theory of defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first appeal of the case, a panel held that a statute was constitutional under the Title-Object Clause of the state constitution, and therefore validly placed a condition on defendant's use of appropriations for community corrections facilities, and that the trial court had erred in dismissing the city's complaint. By revisiting the issue of legislative intent, ignoring the fact that an earlier appellate panel had already distinguished a case upon which the trial court relied, and ultimately ruling that the correction department's authority to control the placement of the community corrections center was not subject to the express condition contained in the law, the trial court failed to follow the law of the case established in the city's first appeal. No exception applied because there was no change in the relevant law and a &quot;change&quot; in the language of the appropriations acts referred to in the trial court's opinion occurred before the initial decision of the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient's first medical malpractice claim was dismissed because the patient failed to provide a 182-day notice pursuant to Mich.

The patient's next medical malpractice action, filed after the 182 days' notice was provided, was dismissed because it was barred by the two-year statute of limitations pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.5805(4). The patient appealed that dismissal. Meanwhile, the patient filed an action for misrepresentation, which was dismissed because it was essentially a medical malpractice claim. The patient appealed that dismissal also. The court held that the medical malpractice claim was not barred. Though the tolling period of &sect; 600.5805(4) did not apply when the 182-day notice was required, pursuant to 1993 Mich. Pub. Acts 78, &sect; 4(1), the court reasoned that the failure to allow the tolling unconstitutionally abrogated the patient's rights to relief and violated his due process rights. The patient was entitled to the same time period to bring an action as others similarly situated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff husband sought review as of right of an amended decree of divorce entered by the Wayne Circuit Court (Michigan), which awarded custody to defendant wife without considering and evaluating each of the child custody factors contained in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 722.23 and awarded the wife alimony for thee years and most of the marital property. The husband also sought review of an order modifying visitation and a bench warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the course of the proceedings, the husband was repeatedly jailed for contempt. He sabotaged the marital home and his wife's car, refused to pay child support or make court-ordered mortgage payments on the marital home, hid assets, filed many groundless motions, and instructed his parents to evict the wife from the marital home. The court ordered a new custody hearing because the trial court failed to make specific findings regarding the best interest factors set forth in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 722.23. The court held that the remand rendered the husband's visitation and child support claims moot. The court found that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by requiring the husband to post a $ 1,000 bond every time he filed a motion. Even though the trial court did not make specific findings regarding all the relevant factors, the court found that the alimony award under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 522.23 and the property division were both supported by the record and the unequal division of property was fair and equitable. The court concluded that the husband was properly jailed for contempt because it was unlikely that other remedies would have corrected his refusal to pay support.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the award of custody, remanded the matter for a new hearing on custody, and affirmed the balance of the trial court's judgment and orders. The court directed the trial court to amend the judgment of divorce to include required statutory provisions and to reflect the trial judge's ruling that child support was abated for the four weeks the husband was in jail for assaulting his mother-in-law.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed his conviction and sentence by the trial court. The court found that the indecent exposure statute found at Mich. Comp. Law 750.335(a); Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.567(1), provided fair notice to defendant that the act of exposing his penis and masturbating while seated in an automobile parked on a public street with its window open was prohibited by the statute and did not confer on the trier of fact unstructured and unlimited discretion to determine whether an offense had been committed in the context of the charged conduct. Therefore, the indecent exposure statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant. The court ruled that defendant's exposure did not have to be witnessed by another person in order to constitute open or indecent exposure, as long as the exposure occurred in a public place under circumstances in which another person might reasonably have been expected to observe it. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that: (1) plaintiffs had failed to establish that &sect; 2912b(1) was not rationally related to legislation's goal of reducing the cost of medical malpractice litigation or that it was not reasonably related to the achievement of that objective; and (2) their argument that &sect; 2912b(1) conflicted with Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners' parcel of vacant land contained ponds and wetlands. The township planning commission rejected an application to rezone the land from agricultural to a residential district with a minimum lot size of one and a half acres. The township accepted the commission's recommendation that the land be zoned residential with a minimum three acre lot size. The owners challenged the zoning designation. The trial court ruled that the township's minimum lot size requirement was unreasonable and arbitrary because it was not necessary to protect legitimate concerns about water quality, fire protection, traffic, and conformance with the master plan. The trial court also found that the owners' proposed development was not reasonable and declared that the township was free to rezone the owners' property. The appellate court ruled that the challenged sections of the township's zoning law were not preempted by state law, were the proper subject of zoning, and either did not result in a taking of the owners' property or that the &quot;taking&quot; issue was not yet ripe for judicial review. The court found that the owners failed to show that there was a need for additional smaller lots in the area.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the theatres argued, inter alia, that (1) the trial court erred in granting summary judgment of its specific performance claim in favor of the authority; and (2) the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the authority on its lent money claim. Upon review, the court found the theatres' arguments without merit. Because no question of fact was created concerning the existence of a contract, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the authority on the specific performance claim. The theatres agreed that they would seek review of only certain specified claims, not including the money lent claim. The theatres did not allege fraud or duress.

The court affirmed the order of the circuit court, holding that the release provisions of the CSPA did not unconstitutionally deprive defendant of due process or equal protection. The court held that, as with all other civil commitment proceedings, the standard of proof that the state had to meet to justify continued commitment under the CSPA was proof by clear and convincing evidence of defendant's mental disorder and future dangerousness to others in order to have justified defendant's continued detention. Therefore, defendant did not receive different treatment under the CSPA than he would have received had he been civilly committed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, city and its mayor, commenced a declaratory action and argued that 1996 Mich. Pub. Acts 374 violated Mich. Const. of 1963, art. 9, &sect;&sect; 25 and 29 (the Headlee Amendments), and Mich. Const. of 1963, art 3, &sect; 2 (the Separation of Powers Clause).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued that the provision of Act 374 that pertained to the transfer of funding responsibility for the local district court to the city violated the Headlee Amendments because the legislature did not make an appropriation sufficient to pay for the increase in an activity or service required of the city. The circuit court agreed. On appeal, the court held that Act 374 did not violate the Headlee amendments because the legislature had in fact increased its funding proportion on the only item of the district court operation to which it previously contributed and it increased its proportionate contribution to judicial salaries. Therefore, the circuit court erred in finding that the Headlee amendments were violated. However, the court did find that certain provisions of Act 374 that provided for the sharing of authority over district court employees violated the Separation of Powers Clause because the proposed relationship disrupted the delicate balance between the judiciary's right to control its employees and the county's responsibility to fund the district courts, and created the potential for overreaching by the county.</SPAN></P>

Acts 505 stated that the Tax Tribunal had jurisdiction to adjudicate matters of exemption for years subsequent to the year the petition was filed in which there was an assessment, without the petitioner filing any other petitions or amendments. However, because this provision was not in effect at the time petitioner filed its claim, it was not applicable.

Defendant did not appeal his convictions as of right or file a timely application for leave to appeal. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court considered whether the requirement under Mich. Ct. R. 6.433(C)(3), that a defendant in a postconviction proceeding demonstrate &quot;good cause&quot; in order to be entitled to a transcript of a prior proceeding, was constitutional.The court held that by requiring an indigent defendant to demonstrate &quot;good cause&quot; to obtain a transcript in a postconviction proceeding, R. 6.433(C0(3) did not violate defendant's right to equal protection, even though a defendant with funds might decide to purchase a transcript. The court also found that defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel argument was without merit because while there was a constitutional right to effective assistance of appellate counsel in a first appeal as of right, there was no constitutional right to be represented by counsel in a postconviction proceeding under Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individuals and judge asserted that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.9931; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.9931, was unconstitutional because it filled newly created judicial positions by transferring judges from the recorder's court and not by election, as provided by the Michigan Constitution. The individuals and judge contended that the trial court erred in finding Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.9931; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.9931, constitutional. However, on appeal the court affirmed the trial court's order granting summary disposition in favor of the public officials. Mich. Const. art. 6, &sect;&sect; 11 and 26 (1963) actually permitted the Michigan legislature to expand the number of judicial offices in the circuit court, abolished the recorder's court, and, thereafter, transferred the duties of the recorder's court elsewhere. Furthermore, as to the statutory provision at issue in the case, the manner in which the Michigan legislature provided for the election to fill the newly created circuit court judgeships was within the discretion recognized by the Michigan Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant parked his car on a freeway exit ramp, partially blocking traffic. Defendant failed several field sobriety tests. After failing a breath test, defendant was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.625(1)(a) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9.2325(1)(a)). Defendant then submitted to a blood alcohol test. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the blood test results. The court found that defendant's warrantless arrest was statutorily invalid because the offense did not occur in the presence of the arresting officer. Further, as defendant was not involved in an accident under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 764.15(l)(h) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.874(l)(h)), the officer could not arrest him based on a belief that he was intoxicated at the time of an accident. Despite the fact that defendant's arrest was statutorily invalid, the court found that the evidence seized after the arrest was properly admitted because there was probable cause for the arrest. As the arrest was constitutionally valid, the exclusionary rule did not preclude admission of the blood alcohol test or other evidence seized after the warrantless arrest.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court's analysis under the state constitutional tort claim precedent was inapplicable because the police sergeant was a city employee. Instead, the court ruled, in order for the home owner to prevail on her constitutional law violation claims against the city employee, she was required to prove that the alleged constitutional violations occurred by virtue of a custom or policy that the city employee was carrying out. A direct causal connection between the custom or policy at issue and the employee's actions was required.

The court rejected defendant's argument that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his conviction. The court stated that a rational trier of fact could have found that defendant caused the victim to engage in a child sexually abusive activity in the form of erotic fondling or passive sexual involvement for the purpose of producing photographs of the victim engaged in erotic fondling. The court dismissed defendant's argument that the child sexually abusive statute was vague and overbroad because the court stated that it had already rejected prior claims that the statute was unconstitutional due to vagueness. The court found that the victim was not subjected to a suggestive interviewing technique, and her testimony was properly admitted into evidence. The court stated there was no evidence that any suggestions were made to her or that the interviewers furnished information to her.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed an ordinance creating a historic district that encompassed the landowner's property. One provision of the ordinance required the owner to obtain a certificate from the historical commission before moving or demolishing a structure.

The landowner unsuccessfully appealed the second decision to the state historical review board. The city then brought suit in circuit court to enforce a finding by the commission that the landowner committed &quot;demolition by neglect.&quot; All parties filed motions for summary disposition, but the lower court granted only the motions of the city and the commission. The court stated that the ordinance was a facially neutral, generally applicable law requiring only minimal review to determine that prohibiting the exercise of religion was not the object of the ordinance but merely the incidental effect. The court held that the ordinance did not give the commission authority over the landowner's ecclesiastical decisions because the ordinance was a law of general application that did not burden the landowner any more than other citizens.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the circuit court erred in broadly deciding that the statute was unconstitutional, but affirmed the reversal of the district court's decision. At the time of defendants' allegedly criminal conduct, lewdness was defined in a limited fashion and lap dancing itself did not constitute lewdness unless it was done for the purpose of masturbation and state did not argue that lap dancing was done for that purpose. Although defendant's alleged conduct fell within a newer definition of lewdness, that definition did not apply to defendants because the case providing the new definition was not decided until after the lap-dancing incident that formed the basis for the charges against defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were accused of flagging down the victim's car, assaulting him, cutting his neck, and robbing him of his jacket, watch, and car speakers. Defendants were tried for assault with intent to murder and armed robbery and were convicted of assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder and armed robbery. Because defendants were habitual offenders, they were sentenced to terms of 15 to 30 years' imprisonment. Defendants sought review. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's decision to submit the charge of assault with intent to murder to the jury because defendants threatened to kill the victim during an orchestrated attack. The court also found that the trial court's comments to defense counsel in front of the jury did not deny defendants a fair trial where there was no evidence that the trial court was demeaning towards defense counsel. The court also rejected a claim that defense counsel was constitutionally defective. Although the court acknowledged that defense counsel made errors and was suspended based on representation during the case, defendant failed to show the resulting prejudice necessary to sustain his claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As to both defendants, the court affirmed the convictions for armed robbery and assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed, and the state supreme court reversed the reversal and remanded to the court.

Also, the search of defendant's vehicle without a warrant was harmless because no evidence of value was obtained and the search did not taint the subsequent warrant. Defendant was not entitled to raise the trial court's failure to give him a competency hearing because he did not raise the issue in a new trial motion. Finally, defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective because the errors alleged by defendant involved trial strategy, and the evidence was so strong that there was no reasonable probability of acquittal absent counsel's mistake.</SPAN></P>

The trial court quashed the information against defendants, holding that the statutes,&nbsp;&sect; 400.604 and &sect; 752.1004, were unconstitutional because the statutes lacked a &quot;knowledge&quot; or &quot;corrupt&quot; element.

On appeal, the court held that trial court erroneously determined that the statutes would have been unconstitutional unless they contained a &quot;knowledge&quot; or &quot;corrupt intent&quot; element. The court held that legislature intended that the instant offenses contain a general intent, not a corrupt intent element.

The presentence report reflected both defendant's conviction for larceny and that the present offense was subject to enhancement. Defendant conceded the accuracy of the presentence report in this respect at sentencing. Accordingly, given that the fact of such status was unchallenged, reflection of the fact in the judgment of sentence constituted an acceptable means by which the trial court made the statutorily requisite determination of second offender status. Defendant made no contention that the recidivist statutes were unconstitutional or that the prosecutor's reasons for charging him as a second offender were unconstitutional or illegal.

The taxpayer also argued that the hearing referee was incorrect in determining that improvements to the real property should be assessed as personal property. The court held that the hearing referee did not err in utilizing the &quot;fair market value in use&quot; standard in determining the true cash value of the property. The court further held that the hearing referee did not err in applying the &quot;highest and best use&quot; standard in this case because there was no record evidence that the property was no longer suited to its present use. Finally, the court held that the taxpayer has failed to adequately present the issue of leasehold improvements for appellate review and the court considered the issue to be effectively waived.

The trial court dismissed the action on the basis that the representative had filed that action before the notice period contained in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2912b(1) had expired.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The representative filed the wrongful death action only four days after she mailed the hospital and the physician written notice of her intent to commence the action. She claimed that she did so to avoid changes in the law due to tort reform legislation. On appeal, the court determined that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 2912b, which required the representative to give notice before filing a medical malpractice action, did not conflict with Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 27 (1963), which determined the date upon which a newly enacted law took effect. The court rejected the representative's claim that one of the purposes underlying the constitutional provision would be frustrated finding that the provision included a number of policies. The court noted that the representative could not have given notice and filed suit between the time the legislation was signed into law and took effect. Further, the court concluded that pursuant to the Michigan Constitution the representative had no right to at least 90 days notice before a law took effect because Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 27 (1963) also provided that laws could be given immediate effect if both houses of the legislature agreed in sufficient numbers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate serving a parolable life sentence sought review of the judgment of the Ingham Circuit Court (Michigan), which affirmed the decision of appellee Michigan Parole Board denying parole. Appellant argued that she was entitled to a detailed written statement of the Board's reason for denying parole and argued that the Board violated the Open Meetings Act (OMA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 15.261 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4.1800(11) et seq.).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board interviewed the inmate and determined that parole should be granted. After a contentious public hearing, the Board denied parole and the inmate challenged the denial, arguing that she was entitled to a written explanation of the Board's reason for its decision. The trial court held that the inmate was not so entitled and the inmate appealed. The court reversed and remanded to the Board, holding that although the statutory provisions requiring the Board to given written explanations for denial of parole did not apply to an inmate serving a life sentence, the inmate was entitled to that explanation pursuant to the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution because denial of parole was a government action that deprived the inmate of a liberty interest. The court agreed with the inmate that the Board's denial, made in a closed, informal meeting, violated the OMA, but rejected the argument that on remand the Board should hold a formal public hearing on its decision. The court held that requiring the Board to given a written detailed statement of the reasons for denying parole would serve the same purpose as the OMA.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the trial court's judgment that affirmed the Parole Board's denial of parole, holding that the inmate was entitled to a detailed written statement of the Board's reason for denying parole. The court held further that the Board's decision to deny parole, made in a closed informal meeting, violated the OMA, but declined to order the Board to make its decision in a formal public meeting.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that it was possible to have two different conspiracies to commit exactly the same type of crime. The court concluded that defendant's subsequent delivery conviction was not barred by double jeopardy because it was not part of the same transaction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, various state officials and agencies, appealed the decision of the Wayne Circuit Court (Michigan), which granted summary disposition to plaintiff county, ruling that certain amended statutes violated the Headlee Amendment, Mich. Const. art 9, &sect; 29 (1963), and enjoining the state from enforcing those provisions. 1980 Mich. Pub. Acts 328 amended foster care funding under the Social Welfare Act, Mich. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state changed its foster care funding to counties. The county sought a declaration that the amendment violated a constitutional maintenance-of-support law by reducing state funding. The trial court granted summary disposition to the county on its maintenance-of-support claim. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, finding that the funding cap was not a per se violation of the maintenance-of-support clause without a showing that funding would fall below the level of funding in the year the clause was adopted. The court ruled that the trial court erred in finding the amendment unconstitutional without a factual analysis of whether the proportion of necessary costs funded actually was or would be reduced. The court ruled that the case was not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of claims because the county did not seek compensation, but sought a declaration that the cap on state funding was unconstitutional and an order enjoining the state from applying the cap in the future. The court found that a preliminary injunction did not give rise to a claim for money damages by precluding the state from collecting funds retained by the county for foster care services.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother filed a paternity action against the father. The action was dismissed after the mother and father agreed that the father would pay weekly child support but not admit paternity. A court established the amount of paternity and ruled that the amount could not be modified. The mother's first attempt to modify the child support obligation was denied pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 722.713(b), which denied modification of support orders for illegitimate children. Subsequently, a different panel of the Michigan Court of Appeals determined that &sect; 722.713(b) was unconstitutional. The circuit court relied on that opinion to award the mother a modification of child support. The court reluctantly reversed and remanded the circuit court's decision. The court agreed that &sect; 722.713(b) was unconstitutional because it violated the equal protection clause. The statute discriminated against illegitimate children because child support was always modifiable as to legitimate children, but prevented modification of support for illegitimate children, regardless of need. However, the court's prior decision barring modification based on &sect; 722.713(b) was binding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant was convicted of operating a vehicle while impaired and operating under the influence twice. The Secretary administratively revoked the applicant's driver's license, but granted him a restricted license three years later. After the applicant's subsequent arrest the secretary reinstated its prior revocation of the applicant's license. The applicant thereafter petitioned for restoration of his restricted license. The trial court denied the petition because it lacked jurisdiction under &sect; 257.323(6) to do so. On appeal the court held that under &sect; 257.323(6) the trial court could set aside, not modify, the revocation of the applicant's license only if the applicant's substantial rights had been prejudiced. The court stated that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to grant the applicant's petition to modify the revocation because of hardship. The court found that &sect; 257.323(6) was not unconstitutional and did not usurp the trial court's authority to grant equitable relief. The court noted that the statute did not limit the trial court's equity jurisdiction, stating that the trial court's equity powers did not permit review outside of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent successfully represented defendant in his appeal from a rape conviction. However, the court noted that respondent made false representations during oral argument. Specifically, the court charged that respondent falsely stated that defendant never had sex with the complainant and that the complainant &quot;was laughing through the statements&quot; to police. As such, respondent was ordered to show cause why she should not be held in contempt. Respondent was thereafter adjudicated guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of both counts of contempt. With respect to the &quot;no sex&quot; statement, the court reasoned that respondent's claim of contextual misunderstanding consisted mainly of after-the-fact rationalization. Moreover, the positive evidence of wrongdoing overcame the proof of respondent's previous good character and truthfulness. With respect to the &quot;laughing, no crying&quot; statement, the proofs satisfied the court that no nonfrivolous claim of audible laughter through the tape recordings could be made. To the contrary, crying was plainly present on the complainant's tape-recorded statements. The court also warned that a civil remedial sanction would be appropriate in the future.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the statements were voluntarily made and there was no bad faith on the prosecutor's part by the comments he made during his opening statement. Therefore, defendant had not been denied his right to a fair trial. Furthermore, the court found that Mich. Comp.

Although defendant asserted that evidence regarding his conviction for a past felonious assault had been improperly admitted at trial, the court found that because defendant refused to stipulate his prior felony conviction, he could not claim error in the admission of this evidence. Further, the court held that the requirement of &sect; 750.224f, &sect; 28.421(6) requiring the prosecution to establish that defendant's past conviction involved a &quot;specified felony&quot; was constitutional. Statutes were presumed to be constitutional unless their unconstitutionality was clearly apparent. The court also found that the trial court exercised its discretion in admitting rebuttal evidence at trial. Although the court found that the trial court admitted some irrelevant evidence pursuant to Mich. R. Evid. 402, it found that this error had not affected defendant's substantial rights under Mich. R. Evid. 103(a). Finally, the court decided that on the whole, defendant's rights had not been affected by alleged prosecutorial misconduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction by the Van Buren Circuit Court (Michigan), following a jury trial, for carrying a concealed weapon, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.227, possession of burglar's tools, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.116, and aggravated stalking, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.411i. The court agreed to address defendant's argument that the stalking statutes,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 750.411h, 411i, were unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case arose out of the conduct of defendant toward his wife while the two were still married, although estranged. On appeal, defendant claimed that the stalking statutes were unconstitutionally vague as they related to conduct within the context of a marital relationship. The court first noted that defendant did not claim that the statutes implicated his First Amendment freedoms. Instead, defendant argued that the terms &quot;harassment,&quot; &quot;legitimate purpose,&quot; &quot;unconsented contact,&quot; and &quot;course of conduct&quot; were vague as applied to his conduct. The court determined, however, that defendant's activities clearly fell within the definition of course of conduct, harassment, and unconsented contact as defined in the statute and rejected defendant's contention that a marriage certificate in any way authorized such behavior. With regard to defendant's conviction for possession of burglar's tools, the court agreed with defendant's argument that the statute required a specific intent to use the tools for the purpose of stealing money or property and further agreed that there was no evidence at trial that proved defendant had the requisite intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father challenged the sufficiency of the probate court's evidence in terminating his parental rights. The probate court held that there was clear and convincing evidence that the children were at serious risk of harm due to the lack of permanency of a family or a primary care giver. The father had been in prison during most of the children's lives. The evidence demonstrated that when the father had the opportunity to parent his children during the brief periods that he was not incarcerated, he resumed criminal behavior and drug use. On appeal, the court affirmed that parental rights could have been terminated if clear and convincing evidence supported a conclusion that the parent failed to provide proper care or custody for the children and that there was no reasonable expectation that the parent would provide proper care and custody within a reasonable time considering the age of the children, pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 712A.19b(3)(g). Despite the father's intent, the court was required to evaluate the acts and abilities of the parent.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court previously reversed and remanded for a new trial on the basis that the trial court failed to advise defendant of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation. This case was before the court on remand to consider whether waiver of the right to counsel was subject to harmless error analysis, and whether any error in advising defendant about the dangers of self-representation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.The court concluded that the trial court's failure to engage in the prescribed colloquy regarding the waiver of counsel was subject to a harmless-error analysis, and that the error was harmless if it could be shown that, notwithstanding the failure, the waiver of counsel was nevertheless voluntary, knowing and intelligent. In the instant case, the court concluded that the record established such a waiver. The court found that defendant understood the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation at the time he made his choice. Additionally, the court found that the trial court's compliance with Anderson would not have led to a different result. The court thus affirmed the trial court decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with uttering and publishing a check drawn on a credit union account that she had opened under a fictitious name. Defendant contended that because she actually accomplished her fraud on the supermarket by use of a check drawn on the account that she established in the name of a fictitious person, there was no uttering or publishing violation and she was incorrectly charged. The court affirmed the conviction. The fraud accomplished by defendant in the instant case did not present a case of forgery. Defendant opened an account in a fictitious name, published a check that she knew to be worthless, and signed the check in the name of the fictitious owner. Such conduct did not, as in the traditional uttering and publishing case, establish a forgery, but it did constitute the utterance and publication of a false instrument knowing the same to be false. Defendant's sentence was not disproportionate because it was at the bottom of the sentencing guidelines' recommended minimum sentence range.

The agreement specified that the payments and other obligations were not subject to modification.

The court held that the support orders of a court in a divorce proceeding were subject to modification. Equal protection therefore required that such orders were subject to modification in paternity actions as well. Because support orders were subject to modification, res judicata was not applicable.

The court held that a forensic expert was not necessary because aggravated stalking was a general intent crime for which diminished capacity was not a viable defense. Next, defendant argued that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to subpoena witnesses to testify regarding his mental state. The court found that there was no abuse of discretion because the witnesses in question were not material because state of mind was not an issue. Defendant also claimed that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a new trial because the letters from him to the victim were insufficient to cause the victim to be harassed or stalked as defined by the aggravated stalking statute. The court noted that the evidence showed, and defendant admitted, that he sent the letters in violation of a court order.

The trial court granted the motion, finding that the complaint failed to sufficiently plead medical malpractice, and denying the representative's motion for leave to amend her complaint to properly plead medical malpractice on the ground that it would be futile given the applicable two-year statute of limitations. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the ordinary negligence claim should have been brought as a medical malpractice claim, but that due to the tolling of the statutory period, the representative's action was timely filed and the proposed amendment should have been allowed.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws (MCL) &sect;&sect; 333.7401(1)(2)(a)(iv), 333.7401(2)(a)(iv) (Mich. Stat. Ann. (MSA) &sect;&sect; 14.15(7401)(1)(2)(a)(iv)), 14.15(7401)(2)(a)(iv)), the Recorder's Court (Michigan) sentenced defendant to 12 to 30 years' imprisonment upon his guilty plea to habitual offender, second offense, MCL &sect; 769.10 (MSA &sect; 28.1082). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested during an undercover &quot;buy and bust&quot; narcotics operation. Defendant was convicted on cocaine charges, but sentenced as a habitual offender. On appeal, defendant contended that he was deprived of a fair trial and effective assistance of counsel. Defendant also argued that his sentence was disproportionate. The court concluded that defendant was not denied a fair and impartial trial because the prosecution's closing remarks did not amount to &quot;starkly offensive&quot; conduct. Nor did the court find any ineffective assistance of trial counsel because a failure to impeach minor discrepancies in the police officers' testimony would not have affected the outcome of the trial. Because the decision to call witnesses was a matter of trial strategy, an evidentiary hearing was necessary to determine whether trial counsel had a reason for not calling certain witnesses. Although defendant's constitutional right to equal protection did not entitle him to the production of a transcript of the voir dire proceedings, such transcript had to be provided because appointed appellate counsel was not the indigent defendant's trial counsel. Finally, defendant's sentence was proportionate.</SPAN></P>

The nonprofit institution filed a petition with the Michigan Tax Tribunal claiming it was exempt from property taxes as a charitable institution, a scientific institution, or a library. The tax tribunal rejected the petition and affirmed the tax assessments. The nonprofit institution appealed the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nonprofit institution claimed that its property was exempt from taxation because it was either a library, or a charitable, educational, or scientific institution. The court reversed the tax tribunal. The court found that the nonprofit institution did not meet the definition of library because it did have members that were for-profit entities and some of its revenues were derived from those for-profit members. However, the nonprofit institution did meet the definition of a charitable institution and as a scientific institution and was entitled to tax exempt status. The nonprofit institution qualified as a charitable institution because its purpose was to further access to and use of worldwide scientific, literary, and educational knowledge and information and that benefit was inured to its member libraries and they served the general public. The nonprofit institution qualified as a scientific institution because its activities sufficiently relieved the burden of the state in producing scientific information by way of its member libraries thus relieving a governmental burden thereby qualifying it for tax-exempt status.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student's first suspension was under the school's old policy, and her other suspensions were for refusing to serve an administrative detention for leaving school and for defending herself against an assault at school. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court but for a different reason. The court held that the student had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of the new policy because she was not suspended pursuant to that policy. She could not demonstrate a &quot;substantial interest&quot; in the new prior approval policy that would be detrimentally affected in a different manner than the interests of the high school population at large. Her overbreadth challenge to the school's new policy also did not grant her standing. Although she raised a challenge to the constitutionality of the old rule, she neither briefed nor argued the merits of that claim, which she did have standing to challenge.

Defendant city challenged the finding that Clinton Township Zoning Ordinance 291-A was unconstitutionally overbroad and unenforceable under U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff bar owner was prevented from providing &quot;topless&quot; entertainment based on Clinton Township Zoning Ordinance 260, which restricted &quot;adult uses&quot; to districts zoned for general business use. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance but found Clinton Township Zoning Ordinance 291-A to be unconstitutionally overbroad and, therefore, unenforceable. The court affirmed in part finding that 260 did not violate U.S. Const. amend. I because it was a content-neutral time, place, and manner restriction, adequately tailored to serve the substantial interest in preserving the quality of urban life by prohibiting topless dancing only in certain zones. The court reversed in part finding that, although the definition in 291-A was overly expansive where it included exposure of parts of the body visible when wearing a bathing suit, the offending subsections were severable. The court found that the inclusion of a severability clause saved the remainder of the ordinance from invalidation and that those portions were constitutional under the lesser standard afforded to regulations enacted under the authority of U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred when it refused to sever the transactions for separate trials. The court disagreed. Defendant next argued that the trial court abused its discretion when it admitted evidence of defendant's stop and arrest, arguing that no permissible reason existed for introducing such evidence of &quot;other acts&quot; pursuant to Mich. R. Evid. 404(b). The court again disagreed with defendant's contention. The evidence, therefore, was relevant to issues other than to show that defendant had a propensity to commit bad acts. As such, it was properly introduced pursuant to Mich. R. Evid. 404(b). Because the search and seizure was not unconstitutional, defendant could not demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his counsel's failure to object on this ground. Evaluated in context to determine whether defendant was denied a fair and impartial trial, the court found that the prosecutor's remarks were not improper.</SPAN></P>

The corporation helped its consumers become members of the fireworks association, which allowed consumers to circumvent state laws that normally prohibited sales to the general public. The township attempted to enforce state fireworks regulations by seizing allegedly illegal fireworks and refusing to grant the necessary permits to sell fireworks. Plaintiffs filed an ex parte complaint against the township seeking injunctive relief. The circuit court found that the fireworks statutes were preempted by the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (HMTA), 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 5101 et seq. and granted plaintiffs' subsequent motion for declaratory relief. The circuit court also ordered the township to process plaintiffs' pending applications. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that the HTMA did not preempt the state from regulating the intrastate sale, use, and storage of fireworks.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon the acceptance of guilty pleas, the Oakland Circuit Court (Michigan) convicted and sentenced defendant for misdemeanor stalking, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.411h; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.643(8), and aggravated stalking, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.411i; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.643(9). The circuit court also sentenced defendant for violating the terms of his probation. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the stalking statutes were unconstitutional because they were vague and impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to defendant to disprove an essential element of stalking, that the stalking statutes &quot;invited&quot; double jeopardy prosecutions, and that there was insufficient evidence that he violated the conditions of his probation. The court affirmed. First, the court noted that it had already held that the stalking statutes were not unconstitutionally vague. Likewise, the court had also rejected the argument concerning burden shifting. Second, stalking was a crime against the person that focused on defendant's actions and the reactions of his victims. Thus, one &quot;unit of prosecution&quot; arose whenever defendant's repeated harassment gave rise to actual feelings of terror, fright, intimidation, and molestation in each separate victim, even if the same conduct was aimed at two people.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Tuscola Circuit Court (Michigan) entered a declaratory judgment (1) finding that defendant township's zoning ordinance unlawfully excluded mobile home parks from the township in violation of the Township Rural Zoning Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.297a, and (2) ordering the township to rezone plaintiff landowners' property. The township appealed and the landowners cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance prohibited mobile home parks from residential areas and allowed them in other areas only by special permission. The landowners' filed suit after their request for either a special use permit or rezoning that would have allowed them to develop a mobile home park on their property was denied. The trial court found that the ordinance excluded mobile home parks, that there was a demonstrated need for such facilities in the township, and that the landowners' proposed use of their property was reasonable. On appeal, the township argued that the trial court erred in its conclusions, while the landowners argued that the trial court erred in denying their request for attorney fees. Both parties argued that the trial court usurped a legislative function and violated the separation of powers doctrine by ordering the township to rezone the landowners' property. The appellate court vacated the trial court's order of rezoning and remanded the case for entry of an injunction prohibiting the township from interfering with the landowners' reasonable use of their property, holding that such an injunction was the proper remedy. The court rejected the parties' remaining contentions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's finding that the township engaged in unlawful exclusionary zoning, but vacated the trial court's order of rezoning and remanded the case for entry of an injunction prohibiting the township from interfering with the landowners' reasonable use of their property as a mobile home park.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs, a corporation and a fireworks association, filed an ex parte complaint against the township seeking injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation operated a store in the township that sold fireworks. The corporation helped its consumers become members of the fireworks association, which allowed consumers to circumvent state laws that normally prohibited sales to the general public. The township attempted to enforce state fireworks regulations by seizing allegedly illegal fireworks and refusing to grant the necessary permits to sell fireworks. Plaintiffs filed an ex parte complaint against the township seeking injunctive relief. The circuit court found that the fireworks statutes were preempted by the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (HMTA), 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 5101 et seq. and granted plaintiffs' subsequent motion for declaratory relief. The circuit court also ordered the township to process plaintiffs' pending applications. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that the HTMA did not preempt the state from regulating the intrastate sale, use, and storage of fireworks. The court noted that the purpose of HMTA was to provide adequate protection against inherent risks in the transportation of hazardous material in commerce by improving the authority of the Secretary of Transportation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued that the tax court improperly upheld assessments the town made using an &quot;in-use&quot; multiplier set forth in the Michigan State Tax Commission manual (manual), and claimed that the manual prescribed a nonuniform, unconstitutional system of taxing personal property. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 3 did call for the uniform taxation of property, and that the manual provided that true cash value of property that was not idle, obsolete, or surplus was to be calculated with the in-use multiplier. The court found that the company did not offer any evidence that the in-use multiplier did not accurately calculate the true cash value of its property. The court also rejected the company's claim that the economic residual multiplier should have been used, finding that the company did not offer any evidence that its application to all personal property would have resulted in values that were closer to true cash values. Thus, the court concluded that the tax court correctly held that the company had not proved that the economic residual multiplier should have been used.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate pleaded no contest to second-degree murder for an offense that occurred on December 4, 1981. The trial judge sentenced him to 20 to 30 years' imprisonment. From the time that the inmate was initially incarcerated, he earned 4,056 days of regular good-time credit and 2,028 days of special good time credit. The department of corrections applied the credit to the inmate's maximum sentence. As a result, his 30 year maximum sentence was scheduled to be completed in 13 years. The attorney sought to prevent the inmate's release by filing a complaint seeking declaratory relief against the department of corrections. The trial court denied the complaint for declaratory relief. The court affirmed and held that under the law as it existed in 1981, the inmate was entitled to good-time and special good-time credits applied to his maximum term. Therefore, any interpretation of the sentencing statutes that would prevent the inmate from acquiring those credits would enhance his sentence and violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws.</SPAN></P>

She then ran from the house to her father's home. Defendant was charged and convicted of second-degree criminal sexual conduct. During his trial, the jury asked the judge to interpret the statutory language &quot;construed for sexual purposes.&quot; The judge instructed the jury that the language meant that defendant should be found guilty if his actions could reasonably be interpreted as having been for the purpose of sexual gratification. The court affirmed the judgment, by holding that the criminal sexual conduct statute was not unconstitutionally vague because its inclusion of a reasonable person standard provided a structure to guide the jury's determination of the purpose of the contact. The court also found that the judge's instruction was not inadequate because defendant's mens rea was not relevant to this general intent crime and the jury did not need to find that he specifically intended sexual gratification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff personal representative (PR) appealed from the Wayne Circuit Court (Michigan) judgment on a jury verdict of no cause of action in her medical malpractice and wrongful death case against defendants, two hospitals and a doctor, for the alleged failure to diagnose and properly treat the decedent. The PR appealed striking an expert witness, precluding autopsy testimony, the standard of care instructions, and mediation sanctions awarded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The PR argued that the doctor should have treated decedent differently and should have told him more about his abnormal thallium studies so he could have told his hospital, prompting a pre-operative cardiology evaluation probably resulting in non-surgical procedures and averting his sudden death at age 69. Defendants argued that the doctor complied with the applicable standard of care and had no role in the demise. The court affirmed in part. It could not conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to allow certain expert testimony. It disagreed with the PR that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that the doctor be held to the standard of care of a cardiologist, striking all references in a video deposition on the standard of care for an internist. The court did, however, agree that certain costs were improperly awarded. The fees paid for the video deposition were properly charged but those of other depositions were not. The PR sufficiently established costs were wrongfully awarded. The court was unable to determine whether excessive attorney fees were awarded as the record lacked adequate explanation. The case was remanded for a hearing on fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff foreign insurer appealed a judgment of the Ingham Circuit Court (Michigan), which upheld a refusal by defendant Michigan Commissioner of Insurance to requalify the insurer for a certificate of authority, after a change of control, under &sect; 405 of the Insurance Code, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.405. The insurer also appealed the denial of injunctive relief and the circuit court's refusal to hold &sect; 405 unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer, which was domiciled in Ohio, had continuously maintained an unrestricted license in Michigan since 1904. The insurer's ownership changed hands after &sect; 405 went into effect but before amendments were made to the requalification procedure. The Commissioner notified the insurer that its certificate of authority had been automatically revoked because of a failure to requalify and the circuit court dismissed the insurer's claim for relief. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. Although the insurer raised several issues on appeal, the court's conclusion that the insurer was entitled to a contested case hearing made it unnecessary to address all of its claims. The court first noted that its decision applied only to foreign insurers as to which control was transferred between October 1, 1992 and June 27, 1994. The statute was silent on the issue of pre-amendment requalification procedures, however, the requalification of an insurer holding a certificate of authority was more akin to a revocation proceeding than a decision respecting an initial application for qualification, and a contested case review was most consistent with the statutory scheme as originally enacted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the circuit court's decision, vacating the automatic revocation and remanding for a contested case hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property developer held an option to purchase a 104-acre lot. The option was contingent upon the rezoning of the property to permit the development of a mobile home park upon the property. The township denied the property developer's rezoning application, and the property developer and property owner filed an action that asserted that the township's zoning ordinances constituted exclusionary zoning and that the township's denial amounted to a taking. The trial court granted summary disposition in favor of the township, and the property developer and property owner appealed. The court first held that the township's zoning ordinances permitted construction of mobile home parks because there were substantial mobile home parks in the proximity of the township. Thus, summary disposition was properly granted on the claim of exclusionary zoning. However, summary disposition was improperly granted elsewhere because material issues of fact existed on whether the rezoning denial was arbitrary and capricious and violated substantive due process and on whether the reasons given for the denial advanced a legitimate government interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant landowners appealed from a judgment entered by the Gratiot Circuit Court (Michigan), which found that they had violated plaintiff township's blight ordinance, Pine River Township, Mich., Blight Ordinance 206, as amended by Pine River Township, Mich., Ordinance 1994-102, and ordered the landowners to clean up their property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners owned real property that was located in the township. They allowed inoperable vehicles, tires, and other items to accumulate on the property. Thereafter, the township enacted a blight ordinance, Pine River Township, Mich., Blight Ordinance 206, as amended by Pine River Township, Mich., Ordinance 1994-102. After the landowners refused to clean up the property, the trial court granted the township injunctive relief under that provision. The landowners appealed from that decision, which was affirmed. The Township Ordinances Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 41.181 et seq., authorized townships to adopt ordinances that regulated the public health, safety, and general welfare. The Blighted Area Rehabilitation Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.71 et seq., permitted townships to broadly construe the conditions that constituted blight. Therefore, the list of prohibited items contained in Pine River Township, Mich., Blight Ordinance 206, as amended by Pine River Township, Mich., Ordinance 1994-102, was within the township's authority. Furthermore, because that provision was a regulatory ordinance, it was not subject to the prior non-conforming uses exception that accompanied zoning laws.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's housing-enforcement inspectors issued appearance tickets to the landowner, alleging that the landowner allowed the listed dwelling to be occupied without first obtaining a certificate of approval.

The recorder's court reinstated the tickets, finding the ordinance was constitutional and applied to the landowner and that the housing inspectors had authority to issue the appearance tickets. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the legislature intended to authorize the city to pass an ordinance authorizing its inspectors to issue appearance tickets, but such authority could not be implied because the language of the statute was explicit. Therefore, the appearance tickets were improperly issued and should have been dismissed because the city had not adopted an ordinance authorizing the housing inspectors to issue the appearance tickets.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city revoked the landlords' rental license. The landlords sought review by the housing appeals board, which upheld the revocation. The landlords then sought judicial review of the housing appeals board's decision. The city filed a motion for summary disposition pursuant to Mich. Ct. R. 2.116(C)(7), (C)(8), (C)(10), which the trial court granted. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court ruled that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the appeal from a municipal administrative agency because the landlords failed to bring an action for an order of superintending control within 21 days of the agency's decision as required by Mich. Ct. R. 7.101(B). The court held that the landlords' due process and takings claims were not separate causes of action but were in essence an appeal from the appeals board's decision, over which the trial court lacked jurisdiction. Thus, because the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal, summary disposition for the city was proper, although the court noted that the trial court should not have addressed the merits of the case.</SPAN></P>

Defendants were charged with gross indecency under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.338b (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.570(2)).

The court held that the only evidence of duress consisted of inadmissible hearsay. The court held that the trial court erred when it admitted a blood test but the error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt and because there was no reasonable probability that the error affected the outcome of the trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Violence by counter-demonstrators broke out at a prior rally held by the protestors despite the presence of 500 law enforcement officers, so when the protestors were granted a permit for another rally, the mayor and city applied for an injunction to require that it be held at an alternative site to allow for better security. The protestors counterclaimed, alleging, inter alia, that the suit constituted a prior restraint on speech, in violation of their First Amendment rights. In light of the public safety concerns, the circuit court issued the injunction, but the appellate court peremptorily reversed. The circuit court then entered a summary disposition on the counterclaim in favor of the mayor and city. The protestors appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that the mayor and city were not liable for the wrongful issuance of the overly broad injunction. Even if the protestors were harmed by the violation of their First Amendment rights, the actions of the mayor and city in seeking the injunction did not cause the violation. Rather, the violation was caused by the circuit court's erroneous issuance of the injunction.</SPAN></P>

The Board denied his application based upon inconsistencies with the resume he provided, his interview at the hearing, and the information obtained during its investigation. The applicant filed a complaint for superintending control, claiming that the Board's decision exceeded its jurisdiction because the statutory criteria for granting a permit was not met. The trial court dismissed the complaint for superintending control when it was brought to the court's attention that the applicant was no longer employed with the alarm company. The trial court determined that the claim was moot. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that for superintending control to lie, a plaintiff must establish the absence of an adequate legal remedy and that a defendant failed to perform a clear legal duty. The court found that the applicant's supporting reason, that an alarm company employed him, was no longer valid. The applicant did not possess a property interest in obtaining a concealed weapon permit because he did not have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In both actions, the inmates sought to block enforcement of new rules related to the DOC's standardized visitation policy.

Laws &sect; 24.245 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.560(145)). The trial court agreed with the DOC and with respondent office of regulatory reform that the APA provision was unconstitutional and, thus, the rules did not need to meet the provision's requirements. In the second action, the trial court found that the inmate failed to carry his burden of demonstrating a threat of irreparable harm in his request for a restraining order. The court affirmed both judgments. The court agreed that the APA provision failed to satisfy the enactment and presentment provisions of the Michigan Constitution because it effectively empowered the legislature's joint committee on administrative rules to veto administrative rules.

Pub. Acts 133, commonly known as the &quot;informed consent law,&quot; which was codified at Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 333.17014, 333.17015, 333.17515 (Mich. Stat.

Both parties brought a motion for summary judgment, and the trial court granted the doctors' motion. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the Michigan constitution did not guarantee a right to abortion separate from that contained in the federal constitution because, when the state constitution was adopted, abortion was a criminal offense under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.14 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.204). The court also based its holding on Michigan Supreme Court precedent. The court held that the Headlee Amendment, Mich. Const. art. IX, &sect; 29, did not require that implementing new legislation be funded from new appropriations as opposed to an existing budget. Therefore, the court remanded to determine whether the statute violated art. IX, &sect; 29, regarding its requirements for local public health departments and, if so, whether that provision was severable. The court also held that the &quot;informed consent law&quot; did not violate the state constitutional right to privacy because its provisions were reasonably related to legitimate legislative objectives.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws 600.2169(1) (Mich. Stat. Ann. 27A.2169(1)) to be in conflict with Mich. R. Evid. 702, and, therefore, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ruling was issued because the doctors objected to plaintiff patient's proposed expert, an infectious-disease specialist who was not board-certified in orthopedic surgery. The doctors contended that the statute at issue precluded the expert from testifying concerning the standard of care of a board-certified orthopedic surgeon. The patient contended, however, the rule of evidence allowed the trial court to consider whether the witness could qualify on the basis of &quot;knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.&quot; The trial court determined that the rule of evidence prevailed over the statute because the supreme court's rule-making authority in matters of practice and procedure was superior to that of the legislature under Mich. Const. art. 6, &sect; 5 (1963). The trial court then held Mich. Comp. Laws 600.2169(1) (Mich. Stat. Ann. 27A.2169(1)) unconstitutional. Because the same argument had been recently addressed in another panel of the appellate court, the court affirmed. However, the court noted that it affirmed only by virtue of its obligation under Mich. Admin. Order No 1996-4 to follow a prior published decision of another panel of the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organization claimed its property, held as a land preserve, was real estate owned and occupied by a non-profit charitable institution and that it qualified for tax exemption under Mich.

The tribunal denied the claim based upon a finding that the property was not used by the organization in a visual, educational, or other demonstrative way, but was simply left to sit, without fencing, development, and without any active use for public enjoyment. In affirming the tribunal's order, the court noted that although intentional non-development for purposes of environmental conservation could satisfy the occupancy requirement of &sect; 211.7o, something beyond the organization's mere occasional or &quot;de minimus&quot; use was required. The court could not ignore the legislative requirement that the organization had to actually use the property for the purposes for which it was incorporated and the fact that the public occasionally entered the property was not sufficient, by itself, to prove the property's use for organization purposes. Because the organization did not actually use the property for educational or demonstrative purposes, it did not &quot;occupy&quot; it under &sect; 211.7o.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Michigan resident was killed in an automobile accident that occurred in Ohio. The decedent's auto insurer demanded payment of the medical expenses from the decedent's HMO, and it filed suit when the HMO refused to pay. The HMO then filed third-party claims against the estate of decedent and the tortfeasor's insurer. The parties filed motions for summary disposition pursuant to Mich. Ct. R. 2.116(C)(8), (10). The trial court granted the motions of the third-party defendants and the decedent's insurer. On appeal, the court affirmed the orders of the trial court.

The court held that the prosecution proved, by circumstantial evidence, that defendant aided and abetted in the breaking and entering. The court noted that a set of footprints matched defendant's and that defendant had binoculars, which was consistent with the allegation that he was the lookout. The court opined that an aider and abettor's state of mind could be inferred from all of the facts and circumstances of the case, including evidence of flight after the crime. The court noted that, although the trial court stated that the relevance of the evidence would be a matter for the jury, it also stated that defendant's objection to admissibility was overruled and the evidence admitted because there was no dispute as to authenticity and relevancy.

The court held that, although the prosecutor did not act illegally, constitutionally, or ultra vires in charging defendant was second-degree murder, there was insufficient evidence to charge him with that crime. There was no proof that defendant possessed the requisite element of malice. For malice to exist to support a conviction of second-degree murder, defendant must have had a disregard for consequences almost certain to follow an action. In contrast, manslaughter merely required disregard for possible consequences. Remand for entry of a judgment of conviction of a lesser offense was appropriate because the was failure of proof on one element of the offense, the evidence supported a conviction of the lesser crime, and other requisite factors were present.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession with intent to deliver cocaine, 225-650 grams, which was statutorily required to carry a term of not less than 20 and not more than 30 years' imprisonment. Defendant's sentence was imposed consecutively to another sentence of three to ten years, which was imposed by a different judge for an unrelated charge (delivery of cocaine, less than 50 grams). Defendant's basic contention was that the 225-650 gram sentence should have been required to run concurrently rather than consecutively to the 50 gram sentence. The court disagreed and noted that at all times, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 333.7401(3) mandated that the sentence imposed for a 225-650 gram conviction was required &quot;to be imposed to run consecutively with any other term of imprisonment imposed for the commission of another felony.&quot; Defendant also claimed that the sentence was disproportionate and that the sentencing court erred by not sentencing him to the mandatory minimum sentence, in light of his behavior while in prison, his family support, and various other factors.

Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2938; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.2938.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the execution of a search warrant, the city seized over 1,000 items, which was virtually the store's entire inventory. The city filed its complaint requesting a preliminary injunction pursuant to the statute. The trial court found that the portion of the statute providing for the preliminary injunction was facially invalid as an unlawful prior restraint under the First Amendment and held that the statute did not apply to videotapes. On appeal, the court noted that because expression was presumptively protected by the First Amendment from regulation by the state, the state was precluded from taking an item it alleged to be obscene out of circulation completely until there was a judicial determination of obscenity after an adversary hearing. Because the statute did not provide any required safeguards, the court held that its temporary injunction provision was unconstitutional. Noting that the criminal obscenity statute expressly included videotapes, the court construed the silence in the civil statute as a determination that it was not as broad in scope and, therefore, did not apply to videotapes. The court affirmed the judgment denying the preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

The tribunal further held that ownership of the subject property was not required by the Act.

Moreover, any error was cured when the trial court instructed the jury during final jury instructions that the evidence of defendant's prior conviction was only to be used in determining whether defendant was a truthful witness and was not evidence of guilt in the instant case. The approximately four month delay, although somewhat lengthy, was not deliberate or used by the prosecution to gain a tactical advantage. The court found that defendant did not suffer undue prejudice as a result of the delay.

The homeowners argued that the ordinance was vague and did not provide fair notice of the fact that a permit was required for a deck because the ordinance did not contain any reference to wooden decks. The court stated that although it did not disagree that certain parts of the ordinance were confusing, the remainder of the ordinance was enforceable because it was clear that a permit was required for such a structure. The court stated that the homeowners did not persuade it that the permit requirement and setback and size restrictions were unrelated to public health and welfare.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 570.1118(2), but did not make an award for the attorney fees incurred by the subcontractor in proving the underlying breach of contract claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subcontractor filed a breach of contract action, seeking money owed for work completed. The trial court confirmed the arbitrator's decision in the subcontractor's favor. The subcontractor instituted foreclosure proceedings when the general contractor failed to pay the judgment. The trial court allowed the foreclosure and awarded attorney fees incurred in pursuing foreclosure, but not those incurred in proving the underlying breach of contract claim. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order. The court held that the trial court did not err in considering the breach of contract claim as a distinct action from the foreclosure proceedings. Under the circumstances the court concluded that the award under &sect; 570.1118(2) was proper. The court rejected defendant's contention that &sect; 570.1118(2) violated the state and federal guarantees of equal protection and due process. The court determined that the legislature could reasonably have believed that allowing all prevailing defendants to recover attorney fees would have placed a financial burden on lien claimants, and concluded that such a situation provided a rational basis for the &sect; 570.1118(2).</SPAN></P>

The trial court also held that the statute was not pre-empted by federal laws or regulations and was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fireworks seller presented expert testimony that the fireworks statute was ambiguous and contradictory and that it neither specifically restricted nor specifically allowed certain items seized by the police. On appeal, the court agreed that the statute was poorly written but held that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.2 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.192) modified the rules of statutory construction for statutes found in the Michigan Penal Code, so that the rule of strict construction did not apply. The court examined the legislative history and determined that the legislature intended to forbid all fireworks that were not specifically listed in an exception. The court, therefore, concluded that the seller's items, which were not listed, were banned. The court then found that federal regulations not only dealt with the packaging and classification of fireworks, as opposed to the sale or use, but also mentioned the applicability of state laws, so that it was clear that state laws were not preempted. The court then examined the statute for vagueness and concluded that it provided fair notice of prohibited conduct and did not provide for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed holding that the Michigan supreme court found that the legislature intended that proof of a mens rea be demonstrated by a showing that the driver knowingly consumed an intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance and acted voluntarily in deciding to drive after such consumption. Therefore, the statute did not violate the constitution. Considering all of the facts and circumstances, the court found that the lower court did not improperly coerce the jury into rendering a verdict. The lower court consistently gave the jury the option to adjourn for the evening and return for deliberations the next day. The record contained no evidence that the lower court created an atmosphere requiring a hasty verdict or forcing the jury to deliberate for extensive periods of time.

In affirming, the appellate court ruled that the ordinance was a legitimate exercise of the city's police power and it complied with procedural due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. The ordinance was not preempted by the Revised Judicature Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.101 et seq., or the Housing Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.523 et seq., because it did not alter the jurisdiction of the district court and the Housing Act expressly permitted the city to adopt another building code to regulate housing. The ordinance paralleled the Housing Act in its definition of nuisances per se and did not conflict with state law. The ordinance did not vest the city council with judicial power and did not violate the separation of powers doctrine under Mich. Const. art. III, &sect; 2.

Ann. &sect; 22.91 et seq.), and, consequently, the PSC should have reviewed the rate increase applications in light of the law applicable to motor carriers. In affirming the denial of the rate increase requests, the court held that there was no authority for the carrier's proposition that its rates and rules should be analyzed in light of the Motor Carrier Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 475.1 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22.531 et seq.). The court found that the PSC denied the rate increases because it calculated that the water carrier would be able to cover all legitimate expenses and still have enough to begin funding capital repair and replacement with its present rates. The court also found that the CWA did not violate due process and did not violate the water carrier's equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

Laws &sect;&sect; 750.157a, 333.7401(2)(a)(i), and was sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment without parole, and the court affirmed. First, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss the charge against him on double jeopardy grounds after a mistrial was declared in his first trial. Defendant did not need to be protected from prosecutorial overreaching because a review of the record revealed that the prosecutor's conduct was not designed to prejudice the proceedings so as to deny defendant a fair trial. The prosecutor did not intend to provoke a mistrial. Nor did the prosecutor's conduct amount to intentional conduct for an improper purpose with indifference to a significant resulting danger of mistrial or reversal. Second, the prosecutor did not commit error that denied defendant a fair and impartial trial. Most of the challenged remarks were proper comments on the evidence. The prosecutor permissibly argued that certain witnesses were not credible and did not improperly bolster witnesses or vouch for their credibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyer and the seller entered into an agreement under which the buyer agreed to purchase three shopping centers. Thereafter, the buyer defaulted on the purchase agreement. After the seller entered into purchase agreement with a bank, the buyer filed an action alleging an interest in the shopping centers, and assigned its alleged interest to the assignees. Ultimately, the seller filed an action for, inter alia, tortious interference with a business or contractual relationship. The trial court struck defendants' answer after they failed to comply with its order requiring the posting of a $ 38.4 million security bond, and entered summary disposition for the seller. On appeal, the court affirmed the order as to requiring defendants to file a security bond for continuance of the title-clouding documents because the order was within the trial court's discretionary authority. Further, defendants outrageous pattern of conduct of circumventing trial court orders established a heightened need for security. The court reversed the order as to the striking of defendants' answer because the sanction stripped defendants of a defense based on a factor unrelated to the merits of the case.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the motion, and the patient appealed. The court reversed, holding that Mich. R.

At issue was how the state treasurer calculated a &quot;deemed tax&quot; the nonprofit corporation had to pay under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.701a(7).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.701a(7) provided that if a nonprofit corporation purchased the provider, it had to pay an additional amount, referred to as a &quot;deemed tax,&quot; calculated as being equal to the single business tax the nonprofit would have paid on the accumulated assets used to acquire the provider if the nonprofit had been a for-profit mutual insurer. Plaintiffs challenged the manner in which the treasurer calculated the deemed tax, as well as the constitutionality of &sect; 418.701a(7), which permitted the nonprofit corporation to bid on the provider. The trial court granted summary judgment to defendants, and the court affirmed. At issue on appeal was the statutory interpretation of &quot;accumulated assets used to acquire the provider.&quot; The purpose of the fee was to offset the advantage the nonprofit possessed because of its tax-exempt status. The treasurer determined the &quot;deemed tax&quot; was to be calculated as the purchase price times the single business tax rate. In arriving at his interpretation, he properly viewed the language of the statute as controlling, and his administrative interpretation was entitled to deference. Further, &sect; 418.701a(7) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, unsuccessful bidders and taxpayers, challenged the judgment of the Ingham County Circuit Court (Michigan), which granted summary disposition to defendants, successful bidder, Michigan Department of Treasury, and state officials, in the action of the unsuccessful bidders and the taxpayers challenging the sale of the Accident Fund to the successful bidder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The unsuccessful bidders and the taxpayers challenged the manner in which a state official calculated the deemed tax on the sale of the Accident Fund to the successful bidder and the constitutionality of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 550.1208(1)(x) (amended 1993), which permitted the successful bidder to bid on the Fund. The trial court granted summary disposition to the Department, the state officials, and the successful bidder. The unsuccessful bidders and the taxpayers argued that the trial court erred in affirming the Department's interpretation of &sect; 418.701a(7) and that the statutory amendment of the Non-Profit Health Care Corporation Act by 1993 Mich. Pub. Acts 201 violated the title object clause, Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 24 (1963). The court found that the trial court did not err in upholding the state official's interpretation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.701a(7) because the state official properly viewed the language of the statute as most important and because his administrative interpretation was entitled to deference.  Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 550.1208(1)(x) (amended 1993) did not violate the title object clause because it was germane and directly related to the object of the statute.</SPAN></P>
