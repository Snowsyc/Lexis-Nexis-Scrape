The first argument failed. The statute was not vague or overbroad. As to overbreadth, the language at issue was the following: &quot;to obtain anything of value or any acquittance, advantage, or immunity of any description.&quot; The statute did not infringe upon or inhibit expression constitutionally protected. As to the second claim, the court found, after a review of voir dire of the jurors, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the jurors could serve impartially and render an impartial verdict according to the law and evidence. One juror had read about the charges in newspapers, and indicated she would require some evidence on behalf of defendant to acquit. The other had a particular dislike of sexual crimes, and the instant charges involved sex.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two defendants were convicted of aggravated escape in the First Judicial District Court, Caddo Parish (Louisiana). In a joint appeal, defendant's alleged numerous points of error, asserting, in-part, that the applicable statute was unconstitutionally vague, that they were not &quot;legally confined&quot; for purposes of escape, and that the trial court improperly refused to issue subpoenas regarding the disciplinary proceedings of two prison guards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One defendant was confined in the Louisiana Caddo Correctional Institute (CCI) as a result of convictions of misdemeanors, while the second defendant was held under an indictment for murder. They escaped from CCI by using makeshift knives to confine two CCI employees. The appellate court rejected defendants' arguments that the statutory phrase concerning circumstances wherein human life was endangered, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:110, was unconstitutionally vague. Defendants' chief defense was that, at the time of their escape, they were not &quot;legally confined&quot; at CCI, because, allegedly, they were lawfully in the custody of the sheriff of the parish. This argument was rejected, because the parish police jury adopted a resolution, by which it agreed with the sheriff to accept custody at CCI of prisoners awaiting trial, sentence, or appeal at the parish courthouse jail. Accordingly, defendants were &quot;legally detained&quot; for purposes of escape. Finally, there was no reversible error in the trial court's refusal to order production of the disciplinary proceedings of the two guards overpowered in the escape, because there was no showing that the evidence was material to the defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a building contractor and its surety, appealed from an order of the Civil District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), which denied their exception of prescription in plaintiff city's action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city brought an action against defendants. Defendants' chief defense was that the action was prescribed by reason of the three-year prescriptive period in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38:2189. The trial court held that &sect; 38:2189 was unconstitutional and overruled defendants' exception. The court did not reach the issue of the constitutionality of the statute because, upon the showing made, the prescriptive statute relied upon did not apply to the type of construction agreement at issue. The prescriptive period was inapplicable if defendants' obligation to construct the sidewalks arose from a requirement imposed by regulation pursuant to statute. Section &sect; 38:2189 applied only to obligations resulting from public construction contracts let to the lowest bidder. Under the performance bond, defendants' obligation to construct the sidewalks arose because, as the bond stated, sidewalks were required by the city's subdivision regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1950, the property was zoned A-1 in the initial zoning ordinance adopted by the city. However, the 1950 ordinance was declared unconstitutional and the property unzoned. In 1958, another zoning ordinance was adopted that zoned the property as A-4, general residential-multiple dwelling. In 1974, the lessee applied for and was granted a certificate of occupancy to operate a car dealership on the property. Plaintiff brought suit, and the parties agreed that the trial court would hear only the declaratory action. The trial court held that the property was unzoned. The court granted writs to review the intermediate appellate court's finding that the 1958 ordinance was inapplicable and the property was unzoned. Because defendants attacked the validity of the 1958 ordinance, they bore the burden of proof. Defendants failed to show that the ordinance was not enacted in conformity with state and local law after appropriate notice and hearing at which parties in interest had an opportunity to be heard. The court held the property was validly zoned A-4 in 1958. Because the neither lower court reached the issue of non-conforming use, the case was remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the intermediate appellate court that affirmed the trial court judgment and held that the property was unzoned was reversed and set aside.

On appeal, the court ruled that the trial court did not err in refusing to grant a continuance, because defendant failed to satisfy the requirements under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 709 to obtain a continuance. The court ruled that defendant was not entitled to a mistrial based upon the prosecutor's reference to an alleged confession by defendant during opening statement, because the statement was res gestae and not subject to prohibition set forth in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 767. The court ruled that trial court did not err in admitting the introduction of the victim's blouse and the lab technician's report, because the victim had identified the blouse as her own, and there was insufficient connexity between the sample and the report to permit the court to admit the introduction of the lab technician's report. The court ruled that the death penalty could not be imposed for aggravated rape due to several decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, and held that the only sentence that could be imposed was 20 years at hard labor, which was the maximum sentence for simple rape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, sought review of his conviction for first-degree murder and his death sentence from the Twenty-ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of St. John the Baptist (Louisiana). Defendant asserted that his confession should have been suppressed, that the trial court erred in denying his request for a directed verdict, and that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant confessed to the murder and the State served notice of intent to introduce the confession. As a matter of strategy, the defense counsel told the jury of defendant's confession during his opening statement, claiming that the gun went off accidentally and that second degree murder was the proper verdict. The State chose not to introduce the confession and the defense rested without putting on evidence, realizing that the State could introduce the confession in rebuttal. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court held that the issue of whether the trial court erred in refusing to suppress the confession was moot because the confession was not introduced into evidence. The court stated that the parties' choices of trial strategies did not affect the mootness issue. The court further held that a directed verdict would not have been appropriate even if authorized under the applicable statute given the circumstantial evidence presented by the State. Finally, the court held that the trial court retained jurisdiction over defendant, as a juvenile charged with a capital crime, despite the U.S. Supreme Court decision striking the death penalty as a sentence under the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for first-degree murder, but set aside his death sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not take the stand. Before the case was submitted to the jury, defendant objected to the trial judge's jury instruction that one in unexplained possession of recently stolen property was presumed to be the thief. Defendant contended that this instruction had the effect of abridging his constitutional right to remain silent. The court agreed. Though the State had charged defendant with armed robbery, it did not attempt to apply the presumption that one in the unexplained possession of property recently taken in an armed robbery was presumed to be the robber. It was incumbent on the trial judge, in giving his jury instructions relative to the presumption of theft that can be drawn from the unexplained possession of stolen goods, to inform the jury of the significance of the phrase &quot;unexplained possession.&quot; In view of the State's improper references to defendant's post-arrest silence, which the State had used to show that defendant's possession of the stolen property was &quot;unexplained,&quot; the jury probably assumed that defendant's post-arrest silence should have been considered in determining whether to apply the La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:432 presumption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court set aside defendant's conviction for armed robbery and remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for aggravated rape and entered a plea of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. The trial jury found him guilty as charged and he was sentenced to death. Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash based on the systematic exclusion of women from the grand jury. The U.S. Supreme Court had held Louisiana's constitutional and statutory provisions excluding women from jury venire unconstitutional. However, the U.S. Supreme Court and Louisiana Supreme Court held that the decision would not be applied retroactively as a matter of federal or state constitutional law. Therefore, the court held it did not apply in this case. Defendant argued that the death penalty for rape was unconstitutional under the constitutions of the United States and the State of Louisiana. The court held that in light of a U.S. Supreme Court decision on that issue, the case had to be remanded for resentencing of defendant to the most serious penalty for a lesser-included offense at the time the crime was committed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for aggravated rape, but the death sentence imposed upon him was annulled and set aside, and the case was remanded for resentencing to the most serious penalty for a lesser-included offense at the time the crime was committed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for first degree murder, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30. The trial court subsequently convicted defendant of second degree murder. On the same day that it denied defendant's motion for a new trial, the trial court imposed the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence for 20 years. On appeal, the court found no merit in defendant's contention that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30 was unconstitutional. The court also found that defendant had no grounds for complaint regarding the alleged systematic exclusion of women from the grand jury which indicted him because the exclusion of women form jury venires was lawful when defendant was indicted. Finally, in response to defendant's speedy trial argument, the court found that the trial had been commenced well within the three-year statutory limitation provided by La. Coded Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 578. However, the court remanded the case for resentencing because the trial court sentenced defendant on the same day it denied his second motion for a new trial in violation of La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court convicted defendant of aggravated rape in a trial in which his motion to suppress were denied. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, vacated his sentence, and remanded the action for resentencing due to the precedent that decreed that the mandatory death penalty of art. 42 violated U.S. Const. amends. XIII and XIV. The court reasoned that the gun that a security guard at defendant's workplace seized after the police requested that defendant be detained was admissible even though the guard did not read defendant his Miranda rights before making the seizure because disarming a suspect did not require Miranda warnings. The court further found that granting the State's request to excuse for cause as to the jurors who stated an inability to vote for the death penalty and denying defendant's request to cross-examine them in an attempt to rehabilitate them was proper because no bias that bore on defendant's guilt or innocence was claimed and the record did not show any. The court also held that allowing defendant to recrossexamine the witness offered adequate protect as to the new matter that the State's redirect examination raised.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's convictions of defendant and of co-defendant related to an armed robbery victim's death and were issued in a trial in which defendant and co-defendant sought a mistrial. The court affirmed defendant and co-defendant's convictions and co-defendant's sentence, set aside defendant's sentence, and remanded the action for resentencing him. The court reasoned that the State offered adequate evidence of the robbery on which the decision to charge defendant with first degree murder was based, noting that the record showed that defendant, who was armed, and his companions gave the victim a ride for the purpose of robbing him and that there was no evidence that the victim willingly relinquished his money. The court also held that defendant had to be resentenced because precedent established that the state's mandatory death penalty for first degree murder convictions violated U.S. Const. amends. VIII and XIV. The court further determined that defendant and co-defendant's failure to show any misconduct by the jurors or an indication that the jurors would not or could not have given defendants a fair trial justified denying their motion for a mistrial.</SPAN></P>

A sanity commission reported that defendant could not assist in his defense and he was committed to a mental institution for two and one-half months. Defendant then pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Defendant was found guilty and sentenced to death. The court affirmed the conviction, but remanded for resentencing. Whether defendant was sane at the time he committed the offense was a question for the jury to resolve. The evidence tended to show that defendant was in control of his faculties on the night the crime was committed. He had contact with several people and they all testified that defendant appeared lucid. However, Louisiana's mandatory death penalty for aggravated rape was unconstitutional in that it deprived the jury of the opportunity to consider mitigating or aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for aggravated rape in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42, which carried with it a mandatory death penalty that he received upon conviction. At trial, after indicating that he wished to plead guilty to a lesser offense and after a plea agreement was so negotiated, defendant indicated to the court that he did not wish to waive his rights and plead guilty. Defendant did not object to any error at the time, but indicated later that he was prejudiced by the jury's awareness of his proposed guilty plea. Citing La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 841, the court ruled that defendant waived his right to attack the judgment on these grounds on appeal, as he failed to make the required contemporaneous objection. While sustaining the conviction, the court, however, annulled the mandatory death penalty on the basis of a U.S. Supreme Court decision rendered pending appeal. Drawing an analogy with the stricken mandatory death penalty under a first-degree murder statute, the court found the statute herein also afforded no meaningful consideration of mitigating factors and allowed the jury to consider verdicts on lesser offenses even if no evidence supported them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants entered the home of the victim. After taking a quantity of cash from her purse, and with a gun at the victim's head, defendants ordered the victim to remove her clothes. She was gagged with a napkin and two of the three defendants raped her. Defendants were apprehended in the victim's apartment immediately after the rapes occurred. Defendants were tried jointly on the charge of aggravated rape. Two of the three defendants were convicted of attempted aggravated rape and sentenced to 25 years in prison. The third defendant was convicted of aggravated rape and sentenced to death. On appeal the third defendant's major assertions were that the lower court judge erred when he refused to grant a severance and the State's failure to compensate his court appointed attorney for his services violated his rights under La. Const. art 1, &sect; 13. The court affirmed the convictions and sentences of two of the three defendants and affirmed the conviction of the third defendant and remanded his case for resentencing. The court held that the fact that defendant wished to call his co-defendants, as witness was not sufficient ground for a severance and &sect; 13 had not been violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants robbed a bank and killed a teller. On appeal of their convictions they argued that they were denied a fair trial and that the death sentence was cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that the trial court properly denied defendants a change of venue, because the evidence did not show that public opinion was unduly inflamed at the time of the trial. The court also determined that the grand jury venire and petit jury venire were not unconstitutional due to the sporadic exclusion of some exempt persons, because there was no systematic exclusion of all exempt persons. In addition, the court stated that the prosecutor was under no duty to disclose in a bill of particulars whether he had in his possession inculpatory statements made by the defendant, or whether he intended to introduce such statements at trial. Finally, the court concluded that because the death penalty had been declared invalid by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30 (1973), defendants' sentence was reduced to life imprisonment at hard labor. The court upheld defendant's conviction and amended their sentences.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the court decision on which defendant based his motion was not applicable because it was not retroactive. Defendant also asserted that the trial court erred in its rulings on his motions for pre-trial discovery. The court held that defendant had no right of full pre-trial discovery under Louisiana jurisprudence and that the material sought by defendant did not fall under any exception to the rule. Finally, defendant asserted that the hashish was erroneously introduced into evidence when a complete chain of custody had not been established.

Defendant argued that uncounseled convictions could not be used to enhance punishment or cause imprisonment. The court vacated the sentence and held that to permit an uncounseled conviction to enhance punishment for a subsequent offense eroded the constitutional right to counsel and constituted a denial of defendant's Sixth Amendment rights. The court further held that the illegality of a sentence could be attacked at any time and that defendant's guilty plea did not waive all defects in the proceedings prior to the plea.</SPAN></P>

The court granted a rehearing to consider the validity of the trial court's instructions and the prosecutor's comments pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:432 that a person in the unexplained possession of property recently stolen at the time of a burglary was presumed to have committed the burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police conducted a search and found stolen property in the house where defendant resided with his parents. Other than his possession of the property, there was no evidence linking defendant to the burglary. In reversing defendant's conviction and sentence and remanding the case for a new trial, the court held that defendant was impermissibly adjudged guilty without requiring the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every essential element of the crime charged. The court held that the judicially created presumption pursuant to &sect; 15:432 that an accused found in possession of stolen property committed a burglary did not meet the due process requirements under the state and federal constitutions. In order to prove the crime of burglary the State was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant made an unauthorized entry of a structure with the intent to commit a theft or a felony. A person in possession of stolen property may have received it from a third person, either with or without knowledge it had been stolen, or may have made an unauthorized entry into a structure without the intent to commit a theft or felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that &sect; 14:80 discriminated between persons similarly situated on the basis of sex, thereby violating the Equal Protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the appeal. The court found that the State's motion for an appeal was made over four months after the order to quash defendant's indictment was recorded in the minutes of the court. The State argued that its appeal was timely inasmuch as it was taken within 15 days of the date on which it received written notice of the trial judge's ruling. The court held that in the absence of statutory authority to the contrary, it would continue to follow the directive of La. Code Crim. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs challenged an order of the Twenty-fourth Judicial District Court, Jefferson Parish (Louisiana), that ruled that their damage action against defendants, a city, a city ambulance service as a division of the city, and the city's liability insurer, was triable by the judge alone against the insurer as well as the municipal defendants under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5105 (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certiorari to consider plaintiffs' arguments that the denial of a jury trial violated earlier caselaw and that &sect; 13:5105&nbsp;unconstitutionally deprived litigants of a jury trial in actions against public bodies. It modified the order to allow a jury trial against the insurer, holding that, under earlier caselaw and under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1733(5), civil litigants were not to be deprived of the right to jury trial except by express legislative provision. The exemption for a &quot;political subdivision&quot; in &sect; 13:5103 was not extended to a public body's insurer, and the joinder of a governmental defendant did not deprive plaintiffs of a jury trial against the non-governmental defendant. The adoption of the Louisiana Constitution of 1974 did not legislatively overrule the exemption for political subdivisions because La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5103 (1975) was enacted after the constitution's effective date and before the plaintiffs' action. It was not inconsistent with the constitution's abrogation of governmental immunity because La. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the basis of a tip from a reliable confidential informant, police set up surveillance at a certain street corner. The police observed defendant one, who met a description given by the informant, participate in a drug transaction while defendant two waited in a car matching a description given by the informant. Police ordered defendants out of the car; during a pat-down search, police seized several packages of heroin from defendant one. The court affirmed defendants' convictions. The court held that the trial court properly denied defendants' motion to suppress the heroin seized from defendant one. Pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 201, defendants were lawfully arrested when they were ordered out of the vehicle; the warrantless arrest was proper under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 213 because ample probable cause existed prior to defendants' arrest that they had committed a crime. Sufficient evidence existed to support defendants' convictions. The intent to distribute could be inferred from the possession of a large quantity of heroin, and there was some evidence that defendant two had knowledge of the heroin and that he shared the right to control it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the Louisiana State Bar Association (the bar), through its committee on professional responsibility, instituted a disbarment proceeding against respondent, the attorney. The basis for the proceeding was the attorney's conviction in federal court for mail fraud and conspiracy. A hearing was held before the commissioner, who found that disbarment was an appropriate disciplinary action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was convicted of mail fraud and conspiracy in federal court. The conviction grew out of a scheme, involving several lawyers and doctors, to defraud insurance companies by staging fake accidents, after which the allegedly injured participants in the accidents would retain lawyers to represent them in their claims. The bar sought to have the attorney disbarred. The commissioner found that the federal conviction evidenced both a lack of honesty and trustworthiness and represented a serious crime. Disbarment was deemed an appropriate disciplinary action. The supreme court held the attorney's filing of a post-conviction relief motion did not affect the finality of his conviction, thus the disbarment proceeding was not premature. Also, La. St. Bar. Ass'n R. art. XV, &sect; 8, para. 7 was effective when the conviction became final and was applicable to this proceeding. Further, the commissioner correctly refused to consider testimony offered by the attorney to negate the attorney's guilt. The attorney's conduct was reprehensible and violated basic tenants of the legal profession. Thus, disbarment was warranted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney's license to practice law was revoked and cancelled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction and sentence for armed robbery on the grounds that the trial court erred by admitting inculpatory statements, that his Miranda rights were violated, and that his motion to quash the multiple offender bill should have been granted. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. First, the court held that under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 768, the State was simply required, prior to the opening statement, to produce a notice of intent to use defendant's inculpatory statements. The prosecutor complied with this requirement by producing the notice prior to the opening statement, although the notice was produced on the day of trial. There was no requirement that the notice be given earlier. Second, the court held that the failure of defendant to sign a rights of arrestee form did not bar any subsequent voluntary statements. Defendant was read his Miranda rights, and a question asked by the victim and repeated by a police officer did not violate defendant's rights. Third, the court held that the motion to quash the multiple offender bill was not properly before the court because the issue was not raised in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of distribution of heroin under &sect; 40:966. He appealed his conviction on the ground that the trial court erred by refusing to charge the jury that he would be sentenced to life imprisonment if convicted and by allowing a police officer to testify that defendant had been observed making numerous transactions. On appeal, the court held that sentencing was the province of the trial court and the determination of guilt or innocence was the province of the jury under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 802. Defendant also contended that the police officer's testimony was inadmissible because the proper foundation had not been laid, and the testimony was ambiguous. The court held that because the officer was experienced, he was competent under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:463 to testify to the implications of what he had observed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a judgment the Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Ouachita (Louisiana), that granted defendant's motion to quash in his prosecution for violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:1531. It was alleged that he caused to be published and distributed written material about a candidate for public office without identifying himself thereon. The trial court found that &sect; 18:1531&nbsp;unconstitutionally restricted freedom of expression.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found that defendant was charged with circulating handbills that did not identify the person responsible for their publication or distribution and that contained derogatory accusations about a candidate for a commissioner's office. Per the court, to justify a restraint on protected expression such as compulsory disclosure of the source of a political leaflet the State had to demonstrate that there was a compelling State interest for the restraint. The limitation could not be greater than that necessary to protect the compelling interest. The court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:1531 was not narrowly limited to those situations where the information sought had a substantial connection with the governmental interests sought to be advanced. Significant to the court was that even a bumper sticker saying elect a particular candidate would be a basis for prosecution. Thus, &sect; 18:1531 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of being a felon in possession of a concealed weapon in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.1 and sentenced. The State filed a bill charging defendant as a multiple offender under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1. Defendant moved to quash and the motion was granted by Criminal District Court for the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana). The State filed an appeal that was treated as an application for a supervisory writ.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's bill of information under the multiple offender statute was based upon the crime of being a felon in possession and used the same previous felony convictions. Defendant argued that the multiple offender bill constituted double jeopardy and that the legislature never intended that the habitual offender statute could have been used to enhance a penalty imposed under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14.95.1. The Louisiana Supreme Court found that: (1) the State's appeal was going to be treated as an application for supervisory writs; (2) the penalty provisions enacted in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.1 were intended by the legislature to limit the permissible punishment for that offense because the statute itself took into account the fact of defendant's previous felony conviction and the legislature gave no indication that it wanted the multiple-billing procedure to remain available as a vehicle for further enlargement of the penalty; and (3) quashing the indictment under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, the multiple offender statute, was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, who pleaded guilty in the Second Judicial District Court, Jackson Parish (Louisiana) conditioned upon appellate review of their complaints of prejudicial pre-plea rulings, which allegedly impaired their ability to present an adequate defense, appealed their convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants claimed that the trial court erred in numerous pre-trial rulings, which allegedly made useless any continued trial of their defense. Defendants also claimed that their plea was conditioned on the fact that they did not lose their right to appeal. The court held that, if it was not able to afford defendants their bargained-for appellate review, it was required to set aside the guilty pleas. The plea could not be characterized as voluntary because of the non-performance of the plea bargain, by virtue of which the plea was obtained. Hence, the court was not barred from reviewing the claimed errors specifically reserved at the time of the plea of guilty, where the trial court accepted the plea of guilty so conditioned, which the court had discretion to refuse, if proffered upon such reservation. As to the merits of defendants' challenges, the court held that the claim that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30 (1973) was unconstitutional in that it imposed the death penalty was without merit, as defendants were not convicted of violating that statute, but instead pleaded guilty to second-degree murder under La.

In the case, it was the victim, during the course of her testimony, who referred to defendant's commission of rape. Further, the reference to rape was not a reference to another crime the defendant allegedly committed as to which evidence was not admissible. The victim, continuing with her testimony after the motion for mistrial was denied, stated that immediately after defendant raped her, he forced her to engage in oral sex with him, the criminal act charged in the bill of information. The rape was an immediate concomitant of the criminal act, and formed in conjunction with it one continuous transaction. Evidence of the rape was admissible as part of the res gestae.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Thirtieth Judicial District Court, Parish of Vernon (Louisiana), his conviction of aggravated rape and sentence to life in prison. No errors were assigned to the conduct of the proceedings as required by La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 841-44, but he argued that his alibi defense was proven and the verdict was contrary to the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because no motion for a new trial was made under La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 851, the question whether there was any evidence at all to support the essential elements of the crime was never presented to the trial judge. For the same reason, the reviewing court could not technically review the evidence on that basis. Defendant also complained that the jury was &quot;almost all white,&quot; with only one nonwhite juror on the panel. However, the defense did not file a motion to quash to challenge either the general venire or petit jury venire as required by La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 532. Thus, there was no evidence in the record upon which such contentions could be founded, the trial court was never called upon to rule on the question, and no assignments of error were presented. As for the State's complaint concerning the life sentence imposed, any objections needed to be presented to the trial court, with the trial court's determination being reviewable by supervisory writs under La.

Service of process was personally made on the husband and he engaged an attorney to defend him in the litigation. However, he failed to answer the wife's petition and a judgment of separation was entered by default. The husband appealed, contending that the trial court lacked venue because the wife was not domiciled in Plaquemines Parish, but the court of appeal held that the wife had established a domicile in Plaquemines Parish and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The husband again appealed, but it was found that the husband drank heavily, and without provocation, shoved the wife, attempted to choke her, and threw her and the children out of the marital residence. Furthermore, the wife was domiciled in Plaquemines Parish because she resided in her parents' home, with the intention of making Plaquemines Parish her principal domestic establishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictment charged defendant with paying a man to vote. The evidence showed that defendant was in the company of the man, his mother, and three others when the group was going to cast absentee votes. Although the trial court properly sustained defendant's objection to testimony from the mother that she had been paid, the mother answered that defendant had paid her when asked by the State if she saw defendant in the courtroom. The trial court instructed the jury to disregard the remark and denied defendant's motion for a mistrial. On appeal, the court found that the admonition was sufficient. Because the record showed that there was some evidence of the essential elements of the crime charged, the court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for an acquittal. The man testified that defendant gave him a ticket showing the candidates for whom he should vote and paid him five dollars after he cast his ballot. The court found that the jury could infer from the evidence defendant's intent to influence the voter. The court rejected defendant's improperly raised contention that the Bribery of Voters Statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:119, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiff political campaign contributor's suit for declarative and injunctive relief, defendant legislatively designated officials were granted a writ of certiorari or review to the Court of Appeal, First Circuit, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which held that the Louisiana Election Campaign Finance Disclosure Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:1481-93 (1975) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contributor filed suit seeking a declaration that the Louisiana Election Campaign Finance Disclosure Act was unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed his suit, but the court of appeal held the Act unconstitutional. The court granted certiorari and found that only part of the Act was unconstitutional and that such part was severable from the Act. The Act required disclosure of contributors who gave more than a threshold amount to campaigns, prohibited certain conduct in giving, and allowed for criminal prosecution for such conduct. The court held that the portion of the Act providing for the appointment of legislatively designated officials to collect, review, and disseminate the contribution reports was not unconstitutional because the authority given to the officials did not usurp power exclusive to the executive branch pursuant to La. Const. of 1974 art. IV, &sect; 5(A). However, the provision allowing for prosecution of violations of the Act only after information was provided by the officials was unconstitutional because it violated La. Const. of 1974 art. V, &sect; 26(B), which granted the district attorney the authority over criminal prosecutions.</SPAN></P>

The one assignment of error complained that the trial court erred in overruling defendant's motion to quash the information on the ground that the jury was improperly constituted because names were not selected at random from a fair cross section of the community.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the system employed in the parish, certain persons qualified to serve on juries were never given an opportunity to serve because the jury commissioners excluded their names from the general venire on the basis that they fell under exemption set out by La. Sup. Ct. R. XXV, &sect; 2, a rule which allowed them, if they choose, to serve notwithstanding the claimable exemption. On appeal, the court found that the exclusion procedure used by the parish clearly contravened the letter and spirit of the law. It meant that the general venire was not selected impartially, as the state constitution and statutes required, and that the general venire was improperly constituted under our La. Sup. Ct. R. XXV, La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 403, and La. Const. arts I, &sect; 3 and V, &sect; 33 (1974).Defendant's failure to exhaust his peremptory challenges was no bar to the complaint that the selection of the names for the general venire was unconstitutional. In order to enforce the law, the court determined that it was constrained to reverse defendant's conviction and remand the case to the trial court for application of the proper procedures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction and sentence, and the case was remanded for retrial by a petit jury chosen from a general venire selected according to law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of her conviction of aggravated burglary from the Seventh Judicial District Court, Parish of Concordia (Louisiana), on the reasoning her conviction was barred by double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first trial, defendant was charged with aggravated kidnapping, armed robbery, and criminal conspiracy. Her conviction of simple kidnapping was reversed and vacated on appeal. In her second trial, defendant was charged with aggravated burglary, armed robbery, and aggravated kidnapping. The jury found her guilty of aggravated burglary. Contrary to defendant's contentions, her conviction of aggravated burglary was not barred by double jeopardy due to her earlier conviction of simple kidnapping. The effects of double jeopardy did not attach to a conviction that was overturned on appeal. The court also held the doctrine of collateral estoppel did not prohibit defendant's second trial. The court stated the effects of collateral estoppel only applied to those elements which differentiated aggravated kidnapping from simple kidnapping, elements which were not essential to the crime of aggravated burglary. Contrary to defendant's contention, the increased penalty imposed after her second trial did not contravene the due process clause because there was no proof that the prosecutor was &quot;raising the ante&quot; in response to defendant's successful appeal after the first trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a decision of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which convicted defendant of simple burglary in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An individual called police and told them that he had been at defendant's house and saw a fur rug and an orange tape player that belonged to friends of his. The individual had seen these objects at his friends' house. The items were found during a search executed pursuant to a warrant at defendant's house. The court held that defendant's conviction was proper. The trial court did not err in believing an officer's testimony that he showed the warrant to defendant and a person that answered the door. In any event, there was no requirement that the executing officers display the warrant to those present in the place searched. Probable cause for issuance of the warrant was satisfied. The court concluded that the two-pronged Aguilar test for issuance of a search warrant based on informant hearsay evidence was inapplicable to a named and non-professional informer that gave definite and detailed information relating to the stolen items. The trial court did not err in overruling defendant's objection to a jury instruction that the possessor of stolen things was presumed to be the person that stole them. The presumption did not impinge defendant's right against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant complained that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64 violated the equal protection and due process clauses of the federal constitution because it delegated to the trial judge excessive discretion in fixing sentences, without any well-defined standards to guide that discretion. Section 14:64, the armed robbery statute, permitted the trial judge to sentence a convicted offender to no less than five and no more than 99 years' imprisonment at hard labor. Defendant also contended that delegating such a broad discretion to the trial judge amounted to vesting in him the power to legislate, in violation of the separation of powers clause of the Louisiana Constitution. The court rejected defendant's arguments, noting that it had held numerous times that the sentencing provision of &sect; 14:64 was not violative of equal protection and due process guarantees.

The court ruled that the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant knew that he was distributing a controlled substance because defendant sold the pills for $ 5 per pill to the undercover police officer while holding a shotgun on the undercover police officer. The court ruled that the trial court did not err in permitting the State to make reference to an earlier incident where defendant was present when the undercover agent bought phenmetrazine from another individual because defense counsel raised the issue of the quality of the State's case with respect to this incident during trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted simple burglary and sentenced to serve over four years at hard labor. Four days later, the trial court (Louisiana) found defendant to be a multiple offender, vacated defendant's original sentence, and resentenced him to serve 50 years at hard labor. Prior to the hearing on the multiple offender bill, defendant filed a motion to quash, which the trial court denied. Defendant appealed the denial of the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his motion to quash, defendant contended that the Habitual Offender Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, was unconstitutional because it failed to make a distinction between those crimes that require specific intent, general intent, or negligence. Defendant contended that specific criminal intent, general criminal intent, and criminal negligence each represented a different level of consciousness associated with a different degree of culpability. The court rejected the contention, noting that it was not unreasonable for the legislature to include within the ambit of the Habitual Offender Law crimes involving specific intent, general intent, and negligence. The primary purpose of statutes authorizing additional punishment of a person convicted of a second or subsequent offense was to deter the repetition of crime by first offenders and to rid communities of unreformed criminals. The important consideration was defendant's repetition of criminal acts and not his level of consciousness in performing a single criminal act. As such, the court found that defendant's reasons for declaring the Habitual Offender Law unconstitutional were without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's sentence as a multiple offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Seventh Judicial District Court, Parish of Concordia (Louisiana), that convicted him of possession of a controlled substance in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966C and D(1), arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion to quash evidence seized during an illegal search. The court considered the appeal as an application for a writ of review under its supervisory jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A bulletin was broadcast over police radio indicating that occupants of a certain vehicle had purchased cigarette papers from a local store and that one of the occupants smelled strongly of marijuana. Shortly thereafter, a police officer observed a vehicle matching this description. When the vehicle stopped at a store and the occupants alighted from the car, the officer approached the vehicle and noted marijuana seeds on the seats and floorboard. Defendant admitted ownership of the vehicle and consented to a search thereof, at which time the officer discovered scant amounts of marijuana and drug paraphernalia. Defendant was charged with and convicted of possession of a controlled substance in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966. Defendant appealed his conviction. In affirming, the court concluded that the search and seizure was not illegally performed. The officer had reasonable cause to approach the vehicle and detain defendant for investigatory purposes where he had received a bulletin describing defendant's car as being occupied by persons suspected of possession marijuana and where he personally observed marijuana seeds in the vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner obtained a writ of certiorari and sought review of an order of the Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which affirmed an order of the trial court that granted summary judgment to defendant utility and dismissed the owner's action that requested that the owner's ownership be recognized and that the utility remove its power line.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility's power line was constructed on the property when it was owned by the owner's predecessor-in-interest. The predecessor was aware of the lines and employed counsel to notify the utility of her request for damages and compensation, but did not take further action. The owner filed an action, alleging that the utility was never granted a servitude or title for the power line, and sought either removal of the line or payment for the purchase of a servitude. The court of appeal affirmed the judgment in favor of the utility. The court reversed and denied the motion for summary judgment. The court held that an electric power line was a discontinuous apparent servitude under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 727 that could only be acquired by title. The court rejected a judicially created method of acquisition of a servitude by corporations that possessed the power of expropriation, but held that its ruling would be prospective with respect to other actions. The court held that the history of civil law indicated that only servitudes, which were continuous and apparent could be acquired by prescription.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant complained of his conviction by the First Judicial District Court, Parish of Caddo (Louisiana), for attempted armed robbery, to which he had entered a plea of guilty, and of his sentence to nine and one-half years at hard labor with credit for time served, without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By means of a tracking device in money that a store clerk gave him, the police located defendant, the money, and the gun used in the robbery at the home of defendant's father. The gun was actually a blank, or starter's, pistol. Defendant argued that his sentence was unconstitutionally cruel and excessive. The court found that, while defendant was sentenced to serve nine and one-half years, the trial court was authorized by law to impose a maximum sentence of 49 and one-half years. Logic dictated that, because the penalty provision of the armed robbery statute did not violate the prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment, the penalty provisions applicable to attempted armed robbery also did not. The court held that the nine and one-half year sentence that was imposed clearly was not an excessive penalty for attempted armed robbery. The court also held that the trial court did not commit reversible error by refusing to make the district attorney's file and the pre-sentence report, which, according to defense counsel, contained different versions of the facts of the case, a part of the record. The file and report were clearly not evidence upon which judgment was based.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of murder and qualified its verdict as required under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 817. The jury added to defendant's sentence the words, without the benefit of parole, probation, commutation, or suspension of sentence. Defendant appealed contending the trial court improperly admitted photographs of the victim and the gun seized from an apartment. The court upheld the conviction. First, the court held the pictures were properly admitted when the prejudicial value did not outweigh the probative value to the jury. Secondly, the court held the gun was properly admitted when it was not seized in accordance with a search and even if it was, the officers had consent to search, therefore the gun was admissible. However, the court annulled defendant's sentence, and remanded for resentencing. The court held the jury improperly added a condition to defendant's sentence. The court held that the portion of the statute permitting the jury to add a non-commutation clause to defendant's sentence was unconstitutional because, under the state constitution, only the governor could determine the commutation of a sentence and the legislature could not restrict the power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a petition for an injunction and abatement of nuisance under La. Rev. Stat.

The district attorney alleged the premises was a place in which assignation, prostitutions, and solicitation, were practiced, initiated, solicited for and permitted to exist as a practice. Plaintiff further alleged that the defendants maintained the nuisance or knowingly permitted it to exist without instituting legal proceedings to enjoin it. Plaintiff brought a motion to dismiss the suit against the owner, thereby removing the issue of abatement from the suit. Defendants presented a preemptory exception of no cause of action that asserted that &sect; 134711 et seq., were unconstitutionally vague.

The State appealed from the adverse ruling pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 912(B)(1) (1966).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendants were indicted for simple escape, in violation of La. Rev. Stat.

Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 912(B)(1). The court held that the State had no right under La. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(D)(1) (1974) to invoke the criminal appellate jurisdiction of the court prior to defendant's conviction of felony or the actual imposition of a fine exceeding 500 dollars or imprisonment exceeding six months. However, the court treated the State's appeal as an application for a writ of review because the case was the first to have considered the validity of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 912.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot and killed a police officer. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked defendant if he had pleaded guilty in juvenile court to theft and shoplifting. The trial court sustained a defense objection to the question and admonished the jury to disregard the question. The court held that the question was improper impeachment under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:495 because an adjudication that a juvenile committed an offense was not a determination that the child was a criminal. However, the prosecutor's reference to the inadmissible juvenile offense was not governed by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 770 (requiring mistrial) but rather by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 771. There was no abuse of discretion in denying a mistrial because the admonition to disregard the question cured whatever prejudice defendant might have sustained. The denial of a defense request to do a ballistic test did not require reversal where the testing was not relevant to any defense issue and defendant was not prejudiced. There was no constitutional bar to excluding from jury service 25 veniremen who indicated that under no circumstances would they impose the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's finding that the search of defendant, who was detained for a traffic stop, was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment and under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 5. The court held that the marijuana was properly suppressed because the warrantless search was not a search incident to a lawful arrest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's appeal of his conviction and sentence from the Twentieth Judicial District Court, Parish of West Feliciana, (Louisiana), on a verdict of &quot;guilty of attempted escape&quot; was combined with a request for supervisory writs. It was argued on appeal that the verdict was a nullity because it was not responsive to the crime charged. The petition for post conviction relief alleged the unconstitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:110.2 (1969).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the verdict of &quot;guilty of attempted escape&quot; was verbally deficient in that it did not specify that the jury found him guilty of attempted simple escape from the penitentiary. The bill of information specifically charged defendant with a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:110.2 (1969). The trial judge informed the jury that defendant was accused of a violation of the specific statute, which he read to the jury. The jury was also instructed that it could find one of the three verdicts: guilty, guilty of attempted escape from Louisiana State penitentiary, or not guilty. Under the circumstances, the jury's verdict could have been intended only to mean a finding of guilty of attempted violation of the only statute involved in the indictment or the judge's charge. It was also claimed that &sect; 14:110.2 was an invalid &quot;local&quot; or a &quot;special&quot; law. The court found that the statute was not a special law. It affected all persons equally within the reasonable classification of inmates imprisoned at the state penitentiary for purposes of a penal statute punishing their escape. Also, the statute was not a local law; it affected the state penitentiary, wherever situated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, and it dismissed defendant's claim for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

The trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a directed verdict of acquittal; there was some evidence upon which the jury could conclude that defendant was guilty, including testimony that defendant informed a witness that defendant had been involved with the murders and defendant's directions to the witness to get rid of a gun. The trial court also did not err in permitting the state's attorney to refer to the law of conspiracy in his opening statement or in charging the jury with the law of conspiracy when defendant had not been charged with the crime of conspiracy. Evidence of the crime of conspiracy was permitted under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:455 where an accused was on trial for a completed offense if a prima facie case of conspiracy was established. Evidence placed defendant with a perpetrator both before and after commission of the crime and established a prima facie conspiracy case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defense counsel contended that &sect; 14:82 had been applied to make unlawful the offering of sexual intercourse with no requirement of proof that an act took place. On appeal, the court held that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 859 did not authorize the court, when reviewing a denial of a motion in arrest of judgment, to determine whether the verdict was supported by the law and the evidence. Therefore, the court could not consider defendant's argument that the State failed to prove an essential element of the crime. That question had to be raised by a motion for motion for acquittal under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 778 or by a motion for a new trial under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 851. The court held that the conduct in which defendant was alleged to have engaged, practicing indiscriminate sexual intercourse with males for compensation, was clearly proscribed and made punishable under a criminal statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:82. Also, &sect; 14:82 was not vague because, by the clear and unmistakable import of its terms, it required proof of a specific act of sexual intercourse. Although &sect; 14:82 applied only to women, not to men, it did not violate the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife filed suit against the husband and sought a separation from bed and board on the ground of cruel treatment. The wife also requested an award of alimony pendente lite under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 148.

The state intervened and appealed the trial court's finding of unconstitutionality. The court reversed and held that it was reasonable for the legislature to seek to afford the wife special protection during the final stage of the community's existence, given that the husband was head and master of the community of acquets or gains under art. 2404, and the wife's lack of control over her own earnings and the revenues from the community and her separate property.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of marijuana in violation of La. Rev. Stat.

The court granted defendant's application for certiorari and reversed the conviction and sentence, finding merit in defendant's contention that the trial judge committed error in denying his motion to suppress the marijuana. The Supreme Court of the United States granted the State's petition for certiorari, vacated the court's judgment, and remanded the case to the court so that it could determine whether the judgment was based upon federal or state constitutional grounds, or both. The court certified that it determined that the instructor and the school principal who effected the search and seizure were governmental agents under a state law analysis. Next, the court explained that the warrantless search of defendant's duffel bag was in violation of both federal and state constitutional prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures.

On appeal from his sentence, defendant argued that where the State did not file an information accusing him of a previous felony conviction and asserting that he should be sentenced in conformity with &sect; 15:529.1 until after his conviction for manslaughter, it constituted unreasonable delay. The court held that defendant's plea of prescription was without substance because due to the protracted history of his case, the State's delay in filing the information was not unreasonable. Furthermore, the court held that defendant was properly sentenced as a second offender under &sect; 15:529.1 where he was previously convicted of the crime of murder by a court martial while serving as a soldier in World War II after being prosecuted under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The court held that &sect; 15:529.1 did not make it a crime to be a multiple offender; it merely enhanced the penalty to be imposed against multiple offenders.

The principal function of the court in an election contest was clearly judicial, as it was the court's duty to ascertain the truth of allegations that irregularities, fraud, or incorrect counting of absentee ballots affected the outcome of the election. The court's role in such proceedings was in appointing counters and causing them to recount absentee ballots was incidental to an in aid of its function. Unless the constitution stated otherwise, the legislature had the authority to authorize courts or judges in connection with the exercise of judicial power to appoint officers for the performance of duties that were not strictly judicial. The statute did not demand that a court exercise non-judicial power because the main purpose of the statute was to authorize the judicial determination of election controversies and the appointment of officers to recount ballots was in furtherance of that purpose.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought to quash his indictment on the ground that it failed to charge a chargeable offense. The trial judge sustained the motion to quash and dismissed the indictment, holding the statute unconstitutional. The State appealed pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 912 (B)(1). In the original hearing, a majority of the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that the statute was overbroad, and thereby, unconstitutional. On application of the State, the court granted rehearing to reconsider the serious constitutional issues presented. The giving of promises of better government, as well as pencils and other political memoranda of nominal value, would not violate the bribery statute. The court held that the purpose of the statute was to prohibit the corruption of voters, which it sought to do by criminalizing the giving or accepting of money or anything of value at any election with the corrupt intent to influence the elector's vote. As such, the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The State argued that the trial court lacked authority to suspend a sentence that was imposed pursuant to multiple offense conviction under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1. The court reversed the judgment with respect to the suspension of the sentence. The court found that the trial court appropriately sentenced defendant to imprisonment for three years at hard labor, but that there was no authority for the suspension of the sentence. The court held that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893 did not provide authority for the suspension and found that the second paragraph of art. 893 permitted suspensions only for drug rehabilitation programs.

In that area of the prison, inmates were assigned individual cells and their meals were served to them in their cells. Defendant was chosen to serve the noon meal to the other inmates on his tier. When a cell door was opened for an inmate to secure his meal tray, defendant pulled a knife from his clothing and stabbed the inmate 12 times in the back. The inmate died of his injuries. A jury found defendant guilty of first-degree murder and he was sentenced to death. On appeal, the court affirmed. There was ample evidence to support each element of the crime charged. The guards that witnessed the attack testified as to defendant's involvement in the crime and identified the knife recovered from defendant's cell after the murder. Evidence of defendant's prior murder conviction was admissible at trial. It was offered to prove an essential element of the crime under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30(3).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), after conviction on an information charging robbery of property having a value of $ 10.00 in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64. The district court vacated its original 50-year sentence, found defendant guilty under the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, and imposed a sentence of 100 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge, who once prosecuted defendant as an assistant district attorney, denied his recusal motion, along his motion to quash the multiple offender bill of information. Defendant asserted that he was entitled to a jury trial on the multiple offender bill, and that the multiple offender statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found insufficient specific allegations of bias for recusal under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art 671(1). The court held that proceedings under &sect; 15:529.1 related to enhancement of penalty rather than guilt or innocence, did not require a jury trial under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 17, or an indictment under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 15, despite what amounted to a &quot;life&quot; sentence. The court held that the automatic pardon provisions of La. Const. 1974 art. IV, &sect; 5(E) did not apply retroactively to defendant's first underlying offense. The court ruled that the specific enhancement procedure in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 controlled over conflicting general provisions in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 881, 916, which limited jurisdiction to amend a sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was an inmate, along with several other inmates attempted an escape.

The jury returned a verdict of guilty as to all three defendants. Defendant sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in sustaining the State's objection to a question propounded to a prospective juror concerning whether the fact that defendant had served and been wounded in Vietnam would cause the juror to be more likely to find him guilty or not to believe his testimony. The court held that parties had a right to question jurors on their examination not only for the purpose of showing grounds for a challenge for cause, but also, within reasonable limits, to elicit such facts as would enable them intelligently to exercise their right of peremptory challenge. The court ruled that hypothetical questions and questions of law were not permitted in the examination of jurors which called for a pre-judgment of any supposed case on the facts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 14:64, the armed robbery statute, was unconstitutional in that the sentencing range provided in &sect; 14:64 constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court noted that &sect; 14:64 provided for a penalty of imprisonment at hard labor for not less than five years and not more than 99 years, without benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence. The court held that, although defendant did not object to the sentence at the time it was imposed, because the unconstitutionality of a statute on which a conviction is based was an error discoverable by mere inspection of the pleadings and proceedings and without inspection of the evidence, the court would review the alleged error. In affirming defendant's conviction and sentence, the court referenced jurisprudence that had consistently held that &sect; 14:64 was not violative of the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, three men, allegedly beat an elderly couple during a burglary of their home.

The indictment was amended to substitute the actual names of two defendants for the fictitious &quot;John Doe&quot; and &quot;Richard Roe&quot; in the original. The district court denied motions to quash, for a directed verdict, and for arrest of judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that evidence of statements made by the husband during the beating and by the wife to a neighbor were admissible as res gestae, and the boyhood relationship with one defendant was relevant to show his knowledge of the house and explain the wife's recognition of his voice. The court held that a United States Supreme Court decision holding exclusion of women from petit juries unconstitutional did not apply retroactively to require reversal. The court ruled that admission of a photograph of a key as well as the key itself, to show its location, did not violate the best evidence rule.

An individual filed an acknowledgement stating that he was the child's father. The juvenile court issued a final decree of adoption and the natural mother appealed. The court affirmed the adoption, finding no merit in the natural mother's argument that her constitutional right to a family bond with her child was violated and that the reference to a non-incarcerated parent in &sect; 9:422.15 pertained to a legitimate parent who had made timely acknowledgement of the child. A technical violation of a contract was cured when the foster mother obtained permission from the agency to adopt the child. Consideration of the relationship between the child and the natural mother, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat.

Therefore the board had no authority to order the reinstatement. The court found that the employee's removal was not arbitrary, but was due for what the appointing authority considered mandatory reasons: she failed to accomplish the mandatory firearms requirements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A defendant convicted of distributing heroin in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966 was sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal, defendant argued that the sentence was excessive, as the statutory options of suspended sentence and probation were not considered. More particularly, defendant asserted that the trial judge did not follow the guidelines of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1, by failing to consider defendant's minimal participation in the offense and the small quantity of heroin involved. The court disagreed, ruling that the judge followed the guidelines by considering whether the distribution involved an isolated situation, defendant's involvement in the offense, his prior history of criminal activity, including parole violations, and how his family was faring without him. Thus, there was no error in failing to suspend the sentence under art. 894.1. And his sentence was not illegal as a result of an alleged conflict between La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966, which did not prohibit parole eligibility, and &sect; 15:574.4(B), which precluded parole eligibility absent parole commutation of sentence. The &quot;conflict&quot; only involved timing of parole eligibility, not parole.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the sentence of life imprisonment imposed on defendant by the trial court upon resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for writing a series of bad checks in parishes around the state. He argued that he had satisfied many of the debts represented by the checks before he was arrested and intended to cancel all of his debts. He claimed that the district court erred in refusing to consider these restitution payments as a mitigating factor and in rejecting the prosecutor's suspended sentence recommendation. La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 provided criteria for imposing sentence and required the district court to state the considerations taken into account and facts used to impose sentence. The district court permitted defendant to place mitigating factors into the record. Defendant had a prior history of having committed an economic crime. The district court's failure to state restitution as a mitigating factor in pronouncement was due to a presentencing report indicating that the victims had not yet been repaid. The prosecutor's recommendation was ambiguous. The sentence was in the middle range of sentencing alternatives. Given defendant's activities and the discretion afforded in imposing sentences within the statutory maximum, the sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyers purchased a corporation and in exchange received promissory notes.

On appeal, the court rejected the contention that there was a failure to join the issuing seller as an indispensable party. Because he was named as a party, an exception of non-joinder of an indispensable party could not be sustained. According to the court, the issuing seller was not an indispensable party within the scope and meaning of La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 641 because the only defender directly affected by the dispute was the new corporation to which the new stock was transferred. The court also ruled that parol evidence was admissible regarding the pledge agreement because the post-pledge issuance of stock was contrary to the spirit if not the terms of the pledge agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for the crimes of armed robbery and attempted second-degree murder. Defendant appealed asserting that the trial court erred in failing to grant a mistrial after a witness for the State was discharged and in imposing an unconstitutionally excessive sentence. The court held that an accused's right to confront witnesses against him in a criminal prosecution meant more than being allowed to confront the witnesses physically. This guaranty included the right of cross-examination. However, a defendant's opportunity to impeach a witness was subject to harmless error analysis. Here, the discharged witness's testimony was only cumulative as defendant was the only witness that did not corroborate the essential elements of the discharged witnesses testimony. Therefore, the discharged witness's testimony was not crucial to the State's case, and the error in denying the defense the right to cross-examine the witness was harmless error. However, because the trial court did not comply with the guidelines of La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1, defendant's sentence was reversed and the matter was remanded for resentencing. Defendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for attempted aggravated raped.

In affirming defendant's conviction, the court held that the trial court properly admitted: (1) the friend's testimony regarding the content of the victim's phone call to him under the res gestae hearsay exception; and (2) the tape recording of the telephone calls that defendant made to the victim after the attack under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1303(4) because she was a party to the communication. Defendant was not entitled to a reversal, although the State failed to produce the medical report from the physician who examined the victim, because the jury was told that there was no physical evidence of rape. The evidence was sufficient to support the conviction and the jury's finding that the victim did not consent. Defendant's argument that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel was premature. The court vacated the sentence because the trial court gave no indication that it adequately considered the guidelines or defendant's mitigating circumstances, as was required under La. Code Crim.

Appellee parish personnel director filed peremptory exceptions of no right of action and failure to join indispensable parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As written, no. 16331 preserved the civil service classification of court employees who had vested prior to December 31, 1974, the effective date of the present constitution; employees hired after that date were disallowed from classification in the parish civil service system. According to the court, the ordinance was, therefore, constitutional. The post-1974 employees were nevertheless afforded civil service status by an apparent misreading of a valid ordinance, and could not be deprived of any advantages that they had received. The court overruled the personnel director's exception of no right of action because the juvenile court had the right and duty to seek review of the ruling and was the proper party to maintain the suit. The court held that it was appropriate for the juvenile court to determine whether the personnel board might continue to exercise jurisdiction over post-1974 court employees. The court sustained the personnel director's exception of failure to join indispensable parties, as the post-1974 court employees had to be afforded the opportunity to appear in any suit that determined their future job classification. They were indispensable parties to the suit.</SPAN></P>

More than one year later a medical review panel was formed and the matter was submitted for review. The panel found the hospital was not negligent. The widow thereafter amended her complaint and added the doctors as defendants. The doctors filed an exception of prescription and the trial court sustained the exception. The widow appealed. The court upheld the trial court's judgment. The widow appealed contending prescription had not run and under the equitable doctrine of contra non valentem agere nulla currit praescriptio her claim was not barred. The court upheld the trial court's judgment. The court held that the widow's claim against the doctors had prescribed in accordance with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628, thus dismissal of her claim was proper. The court reasoned that the widow was able to act against the doctors at the time that she filed her original action, therefore she was not entitled to the benefits afforded by the equitable doctrine argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants were two fathers and their sons, who were out hunting.

The citations were not prosecuted and the claimants filed suit against the wildlife department, alleging false arrest and civil rights violations. The claimants were awarded general and punitive damages, along with attorney fees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consumer ate raw oysters that had been harvested in Louisiana coastal waters and purchased by a lounge. The consumer had, but was unaware of, a liver abnormality at the time he ate the oysters. He became very ill and filed a suit against the department. The consumer asserted that the department had a duty to warn of a risk of contracting illness from eating oysters, and that the department had breached its duty. After trial the judgment held that this was so and the department appealed. On review, the court found that there was no statutorily imposed duty on the department to issue warnings of the kind asserted. The court noted that the department was in fact aware of problems occurred in certain people after consumption of oysters. The department did take efforts to publicize this fact; such as through physician offices. The court held that the fact that the department chose not to aggressively disseminate the information to the general public did not constitute a breach of the duty to warn. Furthermore, the court determined that the department fulfilled its duty when it published a monthly morbidity report on the subject. Therefore, the judgment was cast in error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was denied admission to two area hospitals, and died from a cardiac arrest. His widow filed a medical malpractice action against the hospital and the doctor, among other defendants. The hospital and doctor filed dilatory exceptions of prematurity, since the widow had failed to convene a medical review panel under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.47(B)(a)(i) before filing suit. The trial court sustained the exceptions and dismissed the suit as premature. The widow appealed and contended that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated her right to equal protection where the statute divided one class of individuals, medical malpractice claimants, into two classes based on their physical condition (those treated by health care providers were required to convene a medical review panel). The court affirmed and held that the statute did not create a classification of persons based upon their physical condition or upon any other specific category enumerated under La. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Society sought to invalidate a rule adopted by defendant Louisiana State Board of Nursing, which created the position of primary nurse associate, which the society contended allowed nurses to practice medicine. The court held that the trial court misinterpreted La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:963, which did not require a review of the rule only in conjunction with a contested adjudicated case. The court found, however, that the trial court properly followed the mandate of the supreme court that the society must submit proof of irreparable injury before proceeding, and did not err in finding that the society failed to present any such proof. The court then held that the society's challenge to the delegation of legislative authority embodied in the Nursing Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 37:911-931, was not a separate cause of action, but was made in the alternative and could only be reached if the rule was upheld. Because the society had not made the requisite showing entitling it to challenge the rule, its challenge to the Nursing Act could not be reached.

The court affirmed the judgment for defendants. The statute was not inconsistent with the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1 et seq., because under the state action doctrine, the state created the restriction of beer sales to cash and the legislature determined that it was in the state interest to regulate beer sales. The statute did not violate the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 because it bore a rational relationship to the legitimate state interest of preventing the wholesalers from dominating, controlling retailers' market power, and maintaining wholesalers' and retailers' financial stability. The statute did not violate the equal protection clause because the classification was rationally related to legitimate state interests and applied to all retailers and wholesalers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court was clearly convinced of the sincerity of the employee's complaints and by his repeated attempts to return to some sort of gainful work activity. Considering the evidence, the court found no manifest error in the trial court's determination that the employee was totally disabled through September of 1986. However, the court held that the trial court committed manifest error in finding that the employee was disabled beyond that date. His L4-L5 subluxation had been corrected, he had returned to work in October and did not miss any more work because of his back condition. The court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1225(B) provided for a week-for-week credit, not a dollar-for-dollar credit, as it specifically stated that for any week in which the employee received unemployment compensation benefits, he would not be entitled to receive worker's compensation benefits, regardless of the amount of unemployment compensation benefits received. The court also held that &sect; 23:1225(B) was constitutional as the state had a legitimate interest in discouraging employees from falsely certifying that they are capable of working in order to obtain unemployment compensation benefits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the judgment of the trial court to provide that plaintiff was only entitled to worker's compensation benefits through September 30, 1986.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the 31st Judicial District Court for the Parish of Jefferson Davis, State of Louisiana, which convicted him of simple burglary of a chemical warehouse in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that he was improperly sentenced as a habitual offender. The court found that the trial court's failure to advise defendant of his right to remain silent during the habitual offender hearing was harmless because the trial court established habitual offender status by other evidence in compliance with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(F). The court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(B) did not contain a sequential requirement for use of predicate felonies, other than that a prior conviction was required to precede the commission of the principal offense. The court found that evidence demonstrated that the five-year cleansing period for defendant's first federal offense, theft, had not elapsed and found that the theft was analogous to a state felony because it exceeded $ 500. The court found that defendant failed to object to the introduction of the documents supporting his prior convictions and concluded that the documents' admissibility was, therefore, not properly preserved for review. Finally, the court held that the imposition of a life term was not unconstitutionally excessive, despite the fact that defendant's prior convictions were nonviolent crimes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The camper was injured on park grounds after she stepped in a hole and fell. She filed suit action against the parks service. Initially, summary judgment was granted based upon immunity principles but that decision was reversed and a trial occurred. As a result, the parks service was found negligent, but there was an equal finding of fault on the part of the camper. The parks service appealed the judgment. On review, the court examined whether the recreational land immunity statutes,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 9:2791 and 9:2795, applied to an accident which occurred on a covered campsite at a state park. The court noted that there would have been no issue if the accident occurred in the true outdoors but, since the park covered the area where the accident occurred with clam shell, a more in depth analysis was required. The court determined that, just because the park covered the ground with clam shell, this did not take the property out of the purview of the immunity statutes, and the parks service was protected. There were no allegations of deliberate, willful, or malicious conduct, and the park was not a commercial profit-making enterprise.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment in favor of the camper and against the parks service was reversed and rendered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant property owners appealed from the judgment of the Twenty-Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Charles, State of Louisiana, which awarded them compensation and damages in an expropriation suit. Plaintiff state answered the appeal and sought a modification of the interest award pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:455.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court awarded the property owners interest from the date of the taking. On appeal, the state argued that the amendment to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:455, which provided for an award of interest from the date of the demand, applied retroactively. The court agreed and held that the statutory amendment did not create or remove any vested right to seek legal interest on excess award because the property owners' right to interest did not accrue until judgment was rendered. The court concluded that the property owners' substantive right to bring a claim against the state for the expropriation of their property was not abridged by the amendment. The court found that because the sole effect of the amendment was to alter the date from which interest was calculated, the change was remedial rather than substantive. The court reasoned that prior to judgment, the property owners' right to assert a claim for interest was contingent upon a finding that they were entitled to compensation in excess of the amount that the state had deposited into the registry of the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended that portion of the judgment to award interest from the date of the demand, rather than from the date of taking. The court affirmed the judgment, as amended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with forging an endorsement and cashing a tax refund check. On appeal from his conviction, he argued, among 19 points for error, that the trial court erred in not granting a mistrial and in refusing to allow his self-representation and that the verdict of guilty of attempted forgery was improper. In affirming, the court ruled that the trial court properly required appointed counsel because defendant had proceeded pro se in another case and based an appeal on ineffectiveness of counsel. The court also ruled that the prosecution's remark that defendant had filed the tax return without the taxpayers' knowledge did not necessarily imply that he had also forged the return, that it was necessary to explain to the jury how he could have obtained the check without their knowledge, and that a mistrial was not mandated under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 770. The court held that attempted forgery was a responsive verdict to the offense of forgery under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 815 and that, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:27(C), the conviction for attempt was proper even though the evidence established that he committed the offense pursuant to that attempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant department of revenue and taxation appealed a decision of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which reversed a board of tax appeals decision upholding a use tax assessment on certain transportation expenses incurred by plaintiff taxpayer and granted judgment in favor of the taxpayer on the basis that the assessment of use tax on transportation expenses was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer entered into a contract to purchase stone from a stone company in Kentucky. The stone was transported at the taxpayer's expense from Kentucky to Louisiana. The taxpayer paid Louisiana use tax on the price of the stone itself, but not on the transportation expenses. The department argued that the transportation expenses had to be included in the cost price of the stone for assessing use tax. The district court held that the assessment of use tax on the transportation expenses would unconstitutionally violate the U.S. Constitution because a comparable use tax was not imposed on intrastate transportation expenses incurred by an in-state purchaser-user that arranged its own transportation. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court noted that the taxpayer arranged and provided the transportation. The court concluded that insofar as use tax provisions imposed a use tax upon the transportation expenses incurred by the taxpayer in shipping the stone from Kentucky to Louisiana, they were in violation of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution and, therefore, were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant snatched a purse off the arm of a woman as she entered a store. Defendant fled, but was later apprehended. Defendant contended that his sentence was excessive. The court held that defendant's sentence was not excessive, but that it was illegal. The trial court gave adequate consideration of the sentencing guidelines contained in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. The trial court considered defendant's youth, the fact that he may have been goaded by others to commit the offense, that defendant caused emotional harm, but not serious physical harm, that defendant indicated he would like a second chance, and that the offense was somewhat violent. The sentence imposed was in the lower range of possible sentences. The sentence was not so grossly disproportionate to the severity of the offense as to shock the sense of justice. The sentence was illegal because La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893 (A) required that in non-capital felony cases, probation must be under the supervision of the division of probation. The trial court erred in ordering unsupervised probation.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the stop was lawful as there was no evidence it was pretextual.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to complaints, DEQ inspectors investigated the polluter's facilities, found discharges, and issued a compliance order for the polluter to conduct clean-up. Although the polluter's manager alleged that clean-up efforts were made, the DEQ found that the measures did not comport with DEQ regulations and the compliance order. The DEQ assessed penalties for the violations and the court affirmed. The court held that the warrantless searches of the polluter's facilities did not violate U.S. Const. art. IV and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 5 and that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:2012 permitted searches where there was a reasonable belief of violations. The statute, which authorized warrantless administrative searches, was constitutional because the oil and gas industry was a pervasively regulated industry in which the state had a substantial interest, the statute ensured compliance with environmental laws, and the two basic functions of a warrant were satisfied. The court held that the penalties were neither excessive nor arbitrary and capricious as the hearing officer considered all of the factors under La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after he tried to cash a stolen check by using a fake identification. Three months after his conviction, the prosecution filed a multiple bill and one year later obtained defendant's adjudication as a fourth felony offender, resulting in his resentencing to 20 years of hard labor. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's contention that the fact that he wore prison garb during his trial constituted reversible error. The court noted that defendant was not required to wear the prison clothes and that he actually refused to wear other clothes offered to him. Furthermore, any potential jurors who indicated that they would be prejudiced by defendant's wearing prison clothes were excused. The court found that delays in adjudicating the multiple bill were not unreasonable. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's requests to represent himself because the motions were essentially delay tactics. The court vacated the multiple sentences and remanded for resentencing, finding that the State failed to offer evidence of the prior convictions and to prove that defendant was the same person who committed those felonies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the verdict but vacated the multiple bill proceedings and remanded for a new hearing on that matter only.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant port pilot had his state pilot commission suspended for a positive drug test. The pilot filed suit under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 against the defendant port pilot board and appellee laboratory. The laboratory moved for summary judgment, arguing that it was a private entity that took no part in suspending the pilot's commission. The Civil District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), granted the laboratory's motion. The pilot appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The laboratory was responsible for urine testing of pilots for the board. On appeal, the pilot argued that the trial court clearly erred in granting the motion for summary judgment, as the laboratory's conduct was indeed state action within the meaning of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The pilot contended that the laboratory refused to allow him an opportunity to have the second urine sample resubmitted for independent testing and that refusal constituted action in concert with the state agency in denying the pilot his constitutional rights. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err in granting the laboratory's motion for summary judgment. The laboratory's only participation in the termination of the pilot's commission was the performance of laboratory tests on the urine samples submitted to the laboratory by the board and the preparation and submission of reports on the results of the laboratory tests. Simply furnishing information to the board did not create a sufficient nexus between the board and laboratory so as to make the laboratory a joint participant in the termination of pilot's commission.</SPAN></P>

The Fourteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Calcasieu, State of Louisiana, entered a judgment committing defendant until his 21st birthday. Defendant challenged his adjudication and judgment of disposition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found to have committed the offenses against his eight-year-old niece and nephew. Defendant first contended that the trial court improperly allowed hearsay evidence to be admitted at the adjudicatory hearing. He claimed that testimony by the victims' mother, aunt, and uncle regarding statements made by the victims was improperly admitted. The court found no error. The court noted that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:447, 15:448 (repealed by 1988 La. Acts 515, &sect; 8), which provided for exceptions to the hearsay rule, had been interpreted to allow hearsay testimony in criminal cases of the original complaint made by a young child who was the victim of a sex crime. Although the original complaint took place about one month after the last offensive contact, there was justification for the delay because defendant lived with the victims, the victims' mother refused to believe that anything wrong was happening, and the victims had previously been subject to sexual abuse by their stepfather. Thus, the hearsay statements were properly admitted. The trial court did not impose an excessive punishment on defendant given the nature of his crimes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant heirs appealed from the judgment of the 22nd Judicial District Court for the Parish of St. Tammany (Louisiana), which denied their motion for summary judgment and granted plaintiff purchaser's motion for summary judgment. The purchaser sued the heirs to quiet tax title to certain land, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2228. The heirs alleged that the tax sale, at which the purchaser's vendor acquired the land, was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vendor, from whom the purchaser acquired the subject land by quit claim deed, had acquired the property at a sheriff's tax sale. At the time of such sale, the property was assessed in the decedent's name, who had died in 1978. One of the decedent's heirs paid the 1979 taxes and returned the tax bill to the sheriff, noting a change of address. However, the change of address was ignored and the 1980 tax bill was again sent to the decedent's address. Thus the heirs never received the 1980 tax bill and did not pay taxes for that year. The sheriff sent a delinquency notice, by certified mail, to the decedent's address. Yet the sheriff took no further action when the notice was returned as undeliverable. Unknown to the heirs, the property was sold in 1981 for nonpayment of the 1980 taxes. Thereafter the heirs paid the delinquent taxes. In reversing the judgment below, which granted summary judgment to the purchaser, the court concluded that the tax sale was null and void where the heirs were deprived of their property without due process of law. Nor did their failure to comply with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1965, in and of itself, defeat their attack of the tax sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment granting the purchaser's motion for summary judgment in his suit to quiet tax title. The court entered a judgment in favor of the heirs annulling and voiding the tax sale in question.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All parties applied to the court for a writ to consider whether the trial judge erred in overruling exceptions of prescription directed at the suit filed by plaintiffs, the widow and children of a deceased cancer patient, whose death was allegedly caused by the medical malpractice of defendants, physicians at a hospital where decedent sought medical care and the hospital. Plaintiffs had filed suit in October of 1988 though plaintiffs knew of a potential medical negligence claim in May of 1987. Defendants had filed several exceptions. The court affirmed the trial court overruling exceptions of prescription, and remanded to the trial court. The court held that wrongful death and survival actions in medical malpractice cases were governed by a three year prescription period, thus plaintiffs filing suit within a year of the cancer patient's death was allowable. Wrongful death actions were to be brought within the three year period, but within one year of the act or its discovery, or within one year of the date of the death of the patient, whichever was later except where the patient knew of the alleged malpractice but neglects or refuses to act for more than a year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being convicted of molesting his stepdaughter, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81.2, defendant raised several arguments on appeal. He contended that the statute was unconstitutional in two respects. Because the maximum penalty was 15 years if the offense was committed by someone who had control or supervision over the juvenile, and 10 years if the offender used force, threats or intimidation, defendant contended that the legislature created two distinct crimes, thereby violating La. Const. art. III, &sect; 15 by including both crimes in the Act. Alternatively, defendant argued that the statute was overbroad and confusing and failed to give adequate notice of what conduct was proscribed. According to the court, the fact that there were alternative ways of committing the crime of molestation, with a corresponding difference in the maximum sentencing exposure, did not make the statutory provisions so unrelated as to render their joinder in one act unconstitutional. The court also stated that it could not agree that the statutory definition of the offense or the penalty scheme was confusing to a person of ordinary intelligence.</SPAN></P>

The school board filed a motion for partial summary judgment. The school board alleged that the cafeteria worker was not entitled to the procedural safeguards of &sect; 17:523 because La. Rev. Stat.

Ann. &sect; 18:443.1 provided that in all the state democratic committee districts, Office A was reserved for female candidates while Office B was reserved for male candidates. As a result, male incumbents from Office A qualified for election for Office B, where the candidate was the incumbent. The candidate lost his bid for re-election, placing third in a field of four candidates. The appellate court held that a &quot;justiciable controversy&quot; did exist as his right to run for either office A or B and his right to vote for any candidate, male or female, has been restricted by &sect; 18:443.1. However, the appellate court held that the statute was not unconstitutional as it did not restrict his right to seek election to a Democratic State Central Committee political office or his right to vote for candidates of his choice in elections for Democratic State Central Committee. A gender limitation on eligible candidates as a means to broaden public participation in party affairs did not exceed the associational rights of the political party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed an action for workmen's compensation based on a job injury against defendants.

In an amended judgment, the engineering corporation was allowed a offset for social security benefits received by the employee with the offset commencing at the time of judicial demand. The engineering corporation appealed. The employee answered the appeal seeking a holding that the governing offset law was unconstitutional, and in the alternative, that the district court erred in allowing the offset to begin at judicial demand. The court affirmed, finding that the district court judge was not clearly wrong in his determination that the engineering corporation had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in terminating the employee's benefits, but also held that the offset law, La.

The court held that the statutory authorization did not attempt to increase the power of the judicial branch, via the sheriff's office, at the expense of the executive branch, via the Wildlife and Fisheries Commission, in violation of La.

The commission was not deprived of any authority and in fact was aided by the additional resources. The court also held that the amendment to La. Rev. Stat.

Defendant did not object to the procedure at trial, and neither did his attorney. A United States Supreme Court decision that invalidated a statute similar to &sect; 15:283 did not require reversal of defendant's conviction; in that case it was held that there must be individualized findings by a judge that a particular witness needed special protection before an exception to the right of confrontation could be considered.

After being charged with second-degree murder, defendant pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to 21 years at hard labor, the maximum term, a sentence that he deemed excessive. The court disagreed. The court ruled that the trial court fully considered the sentencing criteria in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1, namely, such aggravating factors as the seriousness of the crime, previous convictions involving violence, and age, and such mitigating factors as defendant's limited education and lack of steady work experience. Also considered was the lack of provocation for such a crime and the risk that he would commit another. Moreover, the sentence was not excessive, given his reduced exposure to life imprisonment on a murder charge, the facts that elements of the murder charge were present, the crime's seriousness, and that only by the narrowest of margins was the offense reduced.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendants claimed, inter alia, a black juror was excused on a state peremptory challenge without a race neutral reason. The court found that the prosecution showed that the juror was not qualified because she knew both defendants and their families. Defendants argued that the trial court erroneously refused to allow them to challenge statements made by one of the officers. The court held that the trial court correctly sustained the objections because defense counsel failed to lay a proper foundation and the denied statements were not relevant. The court also found that the cocaine was properly admitted, and the sentences were not excessive. Defendants acted as principles in the drug transaction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and an accomplice robbed a store, and during the robbery the accomplice killed the storeowner. Defendant was indicted for second degree murder and convicted of manslaughter. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence as being excessive. The court held that the trial court properly denied defendant a mistrial, after learning of a possible relationship between the victim and the juror, because the juror testified that any possible relationship would not prevent him from being impartial, and therefore the defendant did not suffer any prejudice. The court also determined that defendant's confession was correctly admitted at trial, because defendant failed to file a motion to suppress and defendant freely and voluntarily made the confession. In addition, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow defendant to ask potential jurors about their view concerning capital punishment, and objections to the jury instructions were not correctly before the court because defendant failed to object before the trial court. The court concluded that defendant's conviction was proper and his sentence was not excessive or disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was born 81 days after the mother's dissolution of her marriage to her ex-husband, who was not the natural father. The mother and the natural father then signed an acknowledgment as to the child's correct parentage, and added the natural father's name to the birth certificate. Subsequently, the mother took the child out of state and surrendered the child for private adoption. The natural father challenged the adoption and ultimately the issue came before the Louisiana trial court, wherein the adoptive parent's petition for the adoption of the child was granted. On appeal, the court held that despite the fact that the natural father's name appeared on the birth certificate, he was not the legitimate father. The natural father's rights as the biological father, even if proven, did not equate to those of the ex-husband, who was presumed under La. Civ. Code Ann. arts. 184 and 185, to be the legitimate father because he was married to the mother at the time the child was conceived. Furthermore, evidence of the natural father's extensive criminal record, drug abuse and tendency toward acts of violence rendered the adoption to be in the child's best interest.</SPAN></P>

The court found that, although the trial court did not personally inform the accused of their rights to a jury trial, the waiver was valid because defendants consulted with their attorney before the waiver. The court examined additional alleged errors presented by one of the defendants. The court found that the warrant and the arrest were based on probable cause and found that defendant's presence at the preliminary hearing was not essential to its validity. The court also found that the state's withholding of information regarding testimony was not in violation of Brady because the testimony was not exculpatory and found that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. Finally, the court found that, while the judge did not specifically enumerate for the record the factors he considered and the basis for imposing sentence as mandated by La. Code Crim. Proc.

A vice squad detective registered at the motel and viewed a movie that contained graphic and explicit sex acts of an obscene nature. Defendant was charged and convicted of the crime of obscenity.

Specifically, defendant argued that the state failed to prove that defendant intentionally displayed an obscene movie, and defendant asserted that there was no proof that he was the person who displayed the movie. The court held that the circumstantial evidence was favorable to the prosecution, as defendant was the only person behind the registration desk and in the area when the detective registered and the equipment used to show the movie and the movie itself were found behind the desk. The court held that a reasonable trier of fact could have concluded that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentencing judge indicated that the offenses were very serious because of the great bodily harm inflicted on the victim. He also pointed out the past criminal records of each defendant. He went through a detailed consideration of the mitigating factors contained in La. Code Crim. Proc.

The judge found that neither defendant acted under provocation and that the crime was in fact planned in advance and entered into consciously by each defendant. He further stated that there were no grounds tending to excuse either defendant's conduct and that the victim did not facilitate the commission of the offenses. The court found that, from the statements of the sentencing judge, it was clear that the judge properly applied the sentencing guidelines of article 894.1 and that he adequately stated the considerations taken into account and the factual basis therefor in particularizing each defendant's sentence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of his conviction and sentence from the 28th Judicial District Court, Parish of Lasalle (Louisiana). Defendant was indicted by a grand jury for the second-degree murder of his wife, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30.1. He pled not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. Following sanity hearings, he was found competent to proceed to trial. The jury, by a verdict of 10 to 2, found him guilty as charged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for the attempted murder of his wife. After being advised of his rights, he voluntarily gave a recorded statement confessing to the shooting of his wife, who was shot once in her head and once in her back. The shooting occurred in the couple's home while only the couple was present. After the victim died, the grand jury indicted defendant for second-degree murder. All doctors examining defendant opined that he was competent to proceed to trial. Defendant urged that the verdict was contrary to the law and evidence as his defense of insanity was substantiated by a preponderance of the evidence. In affirming his conviction and sentence, the court found that the verdict was not contrary to the law and the evidence. Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the state, the court concluded that any rational trier of fact could have determined that defendant knew the difference between right and wrong at the time he shot his wife, and thus he failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he was insane at the time of the offense.

She was charged with attempted first degree murder, manslaughter, and drug manufacture. On appeal from her convictions for lesser-included offenses, defendant argued that she was improperly convicted for the death of the other perpetrator and that the evidence supporting her other convictions was insufficient. In affirming, the court ruled that La. Rev. Stat.

The court noted that, when she and her cohorts initiated their attempt and armed themselves as part of their scheme, they set in motion a chain of events which led to the reasonably foreseeable death of one of them while resisting arrest. The court also ruled that the evidence established that the drug operation permeated the home, that she regularly purchased items used to fabricate the product, and that her plea of ignorance of the activity was not credible.</SPAN></P>

The patient argued that the trial court improperly granted the doctor's exception of prematurity based upon the patient's failure to submit the claim to a medical review panel as required by the Medical Malpractice Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.47B.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient filed a medical malpractice action against the doctor. The doctor filed an exception of prematurity based upon plaintiff's failure to submit the claim to a medical review panel. The trial court sustained the exception of prematurity. The patient appealed, and argued that the requirement of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.47B(1)(a)(i) that medical malpractice actions were to be brought before a medical review panel prior to the commencement of a suit was in violation of the requirement of Louisiana Declaration of Rights, art. 1, &sect; 22 that persons were to have open access to the courts. The court examined the available precedent to reach its conclusions. The court found that in other cases that challenged the validity of medical review panels, courts had concluded that the requirement that claims were to be submitted before a medical review panel prior to the institution of suit had a real and substantial relationship to a legitimate state purpose, i.e. the need for health care for citizens at reasonable costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a decision dismissing the claims of a husband and as curator of his wife, and their four children, in a personal injury action, the court affirmed. The wife suffered severe hypoxic brain damage when she stopped breathing for an undetermined amount of time while in surgical recovery. A hospital settled with the husband for its maximum statutory liability of $ 100,000 under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.42(B)(2). The husband reserved his right to seek damages in excess of $ 100,000 from the Louisiana Patient's Compensation Fund. The husband asserted that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.42(B) violated equal protection of the laws. The court rejected the argument that the statute should be interpreted as a limitation on each separate claim for a single action of malpractice, as opposed to a limitation on the total amount recoverable for all malpractice claims for injuries to a patient. Further, the language of the statute was clear that the limitation applied to all malpractice actions, for which recovery was limited to $ 500,000 in total. The clear language of the law would not be ignored in search of the intent of the legislature. La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 9.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff in reconvention, a video deposition taker, appealed from a judgment of the Civil District Court, Parish of Orleans, Division H, State of Louisiana, which sustained an exception of no cause of action, dismissing plaintiff's action to recover damages from defendants in reconvention, a state licensing board and its individual members, suffered when plaintiff was improperly enjoined from taking video depositions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deposition taker argued that a previous appellate decision setting aside the injunction constituted a finding that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:2551 et seq. never applied to him and therefore the actions of the Board constituted a tort. The court found that the Board's action was unauthorized because it did not have the power to require the deposition taker to obtain a license. The court found that, although the Board may have had an affirmative defense of good faith, a decision as to the presence or absence of good faith could not be made in ruling upon an exception of no cause of action. The court found that the reconventional demand did not allege that the Board or its members acted in bad faith and thus did not state a cause of action, but held that he must be allowed to amend. The court also found that he failed to state a cause of action for selective enforcement because his demand failed to allege that the Board's actions were based upon an unjustifiable. Finally, the court found that the individual members were not immune from 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 liability, but found that the claim did not particularize the facts enough to demonstrate a &sect; 1983 constitutional deprivation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and vacated the trial court judgment and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced defendant to 10 years at hard labor on each count of molestation, with the first 5 to run consecutively, and five years on each count of sexual battery, with one count to run consecutively to the molestation charges. All other counts were to be concurrent with the 55-year sentence. The main witnesses at trial were defendant's sons. They testified that defendant forced them to engage in various sexual acts with their mother in defendant's presence. The trial court's judgment was affirmed on appeal. Contrary to defendant's contention, the court found from the totality of the evidence that defendant had ordered the boys to perform various sexual acts with the mother with the intent of arousing or gratifying his sexual desire.

The court held that defendant's refusal to answer whether he wished to waive his right to trial by jury did not constitute contempt of court. The court reasoned that defendant's refusal did not constitute contempt in much the same way that a defendant's muteness at arraignment dd not constitute contempt of court under La. Code Crim. Proc.

At the forfeiture hearing, the State asserted that defendant was involved in drug trafficking based on hearsay testimony that the items seized were intended instruments of a planned crime to buy and sell marijuana. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in permitting hearsay testimony and double hearsay about defendant on the basis that it was admissible as res gestae statements of a crime or as statements of a co-conspirator admissible against another co-conspirator. The State failed to present any of the hearsay declarants, to whom the witnesses referred, to testify at defendant's forfeiture proceeding or to prove their unavailability to testify at trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant former husband appealed an order of the 24th Judicial Court of Jefferson, Division J, Louisiana, which adjudged him in contempt of court and ordered his incarceration for 90 days &quot;flattime&quot; in connection with plaintiff former wife's action for alimony arrearages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former husband had repeatedly been in arrears in paying alimony to his former wife. After the former husband was again in arrears, the trial court rendered a judgment making the alimony arrearages executory, awarding the former wife attorney's fees, court fees, judicial interest, and costs. It also adjudged the former husband guilty of contempt of court and ordered his incarceration for &quot;90 days flattime.&quot; The court held that a trial court's imposition of a determinate sentence in a civil contempt hearing was required to include a purge clause. Because the trial court's imposition of a determinate 90-day sentence did not contain a &quot;purge clause,&quot; the contempt proceeding was criminal in nature, and the former husband was due the constitutional protections afforded in criminal matters. The court declined to address the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4611(1)(d), as that issue was not raised at the trial nor was an assertion of unconstitutionality pleaded prior to the appellate brief's filing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee crashed a seaplane into a pipeline embankment. Blood tests performed after the accident showed that the employee was intoxicated at the time of the fatal accident. The widow and surviving children sued the employer and its insurance carrier for death benefits, statutory penalties, and attorney's fees. The district court granted the employer/carrier's motion for summary judgment based upon La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1081(1)(b), which precluded workers' compensation benefits for work-related injuries caused by an employee's intoxication. On appeal, the survivors contended that &sect; 23:1081(1)(b)&nbsp;unconstitutionally discriminated against alcoholics. The court held that &sect; 23:1081(1)(b) did not discriminate against alcoholics as a class. In fact, an alcoholic could recover benefits so long as intoxication did not cause his injuries, and a non-alcoholic could not recover benefits if intoxication caused an accident. Because a diseased person was responsible for effects resulting from his disease, the court affirmed the summary adjudication of the suit.</SPAN></P>

The court found no indication that the Commission either intended to or actually did deter travel from Louisiana to other states. The employees were denied additional step increases because their prior employment was not with the State of Louisiana. A second group of employees contended they were denied additional step increases simply because of their date of hire. The court rejected this contention, finding that the employees hired after a certain date were not similarly situated to employees hired before that date. The court determined that equal protection applied to groups that were similarly situated. A third employee group complained they were denied additional step increases because they lacked certification. The court rejected this contention, finding that certification appeared rationally related to the legitimate goal of encouraging employees to meet certain standards to continue their state employment.</SPAN></P>

The state claimed that the loans actually came from the major owner of an insurance company that was subject to the regulations of the Louisiana Department of Insurance and its Commissioner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case arose out of a car accident in which a teenage girl was seriously injured. The girl's parents brought a lawsuit on behalf of themselves and their child's estate against several defendants, including the driver of the colliding car and various insurers. The trial court ruled against several defendants, including several insurers. The insurers and the colliding driver sought review. The court rejected an insurer's argument that its policy specifically excluded payment under uninsured motorist (UM) coverage and that therefore the insurer did not have UM exposure. According to the court, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21: 1406(D)(1)(a), automobile liability insurance policies issued in Louisiana were required to include uninsured motorist coverage unless it was rejected by the insured. The court found that the UM exclusion in the insurer's umbrella policy was violative of Louisiana's UM statute and therefore unenforceable.The court also found that the award of $ 180,000 in loss of consortium damages to the parents of the injured girl was excessive and reduced the award to $ 60,000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part the judgment below, but vacated and amended the judgment to adjust the amounts owed under two of the insurance policies, and reduce the award to the injured girl's parents for loss of consortium.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a custody dispute over an illegitimate child whose mother had died, appellant, the child's aunt, appealed from the Eleventh Judicial District Court for the Parish of DeSoto (Louisiana), which entered a judgment granting custody to appellee, the child's biological father.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The custody dispute was over an illegitimate child whose mother had died. Following the death, the decedent's sister took her niece to Texas to live in her home. The biological father who was living with the child's mother when the mother conceived, when she gave birth, and when she died, had his name entered on the child's birth certificate as &quot;father&quot;, filed a Writ of Habeas Corpus, and petitioned the court for the permanent legal custody of the child. On appeal from an award of custody to the father, the aunt claimed that La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 256 gave her, a sibling of the child's deceased mother, a paramount right to the custody of the child since the father did not formally acknowledge the child while the mother was living. The court rejected this argument and held that art. 256 did not require a &quot;formal&quot; acknowledgement. The court thus affirmed the grant of custody to the father holding that he had protection equal to that of a caring father of a legitimate child under the Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered the home of a couple that she knew without their consent and threatened them with a knife. The evidence showed that defendant struggled with the husband and he was injured by the knife. Defendant was charged and convicted of aggravated burglary in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:60, and sentenced to serve 15 years at hard labor. On review, defendant argued, among other things, that the sentence was excessive. The court found merit in this contention. The court noted that defendant had obvious emotional problems involving her hostility toward the family she threatened. She also had unresolved feelings concerning the suicide of her son. According to the court, the evidence demonstrated that the defendant's conduct was, to a great degree, a result of these emotional problems, misperceptions, and stresses. It found no justification for the imposition of a sentence of 15 years for defendant, who had no prior criminal record and who had a fairly stable employment history, but who was obviously under emotional stress at the time the offense occurred. The court stated that the sentence shocked its sense of justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a strip of land was statutorily dedicated as an alleyway, the police jury sold the strip to the purchaser under the authority of &sect; 33:4711.

The court affirmed, holding that when a political subdivision formally determined that a thing dedicated to public use was no longer needed by the public, the thing ceased to be public and became a private thing of the political subdivision. As such, the private thing was alienable but only in accordance with applicable law. The police jury could only revoke the dedication. Although &sect; 33:4711 provided the general authority for police juries to dispose of public property, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:701 was a special law that specifically applied to streets and alleyways dedicated to public use, and required that the land revert to the contiguous owner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a driver and the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD), sought review of a decision from the 34th Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Bernard, Division C (Louisiana), awarding plaintiff motorcyclist $ 7.6 million for personal injuries suffered when his motorcycle collided with a car making a left-hand turn at an ill-marked intersection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorcyclist collided with the right rear fender of the driver's car when the driver turned into the motorcyclist's path of travel at night from a rural two-lane highway onto a four-lane road divided by a wide median. Although a blinking traffic signal was located at the intersection, no street lamps or road markings defined the proper turning area. The driver was precluded from seeing oncoming traffic because the glare of security lights from a plant obscured the motorcyclist's headlight. The 24-year-old motorcyclist suffered brain injuries that rendered him unable to move or speak. The trial court found the State to be 85 percent liable for negligence and the driver, 15 percent liable. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err by choosing to credit testimony from the plaintiff's expert that the intersection's inadequate safety markings caused the accident. The $ 7.6 million verdict was not excessive because the motorcyclist required medical care for the remainder of his projected 23-year life span. However, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5106(B)(1) was retroactively applied to cap the general damage award against the State at $ 500,000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the liability findings of the trial court as well as the trial court's damage award against the driver but reduced the damage award against the State by $ 2.5 million pursuant to a statute limiting tort damages recoverable from the State to $ 500,000.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parish filed an action for a declaratory judgment that 1988 La. Acts 875 was unconstitutional because it interfered with its home rule charter, in violation of La. Const. art. VI, &sect;&sect; 4 and 6 (1974), and because the statute was a special law that was not advertised twice in the local official journal as required by La. Const. art. III, &sect; 13 (1974). The trial court upheld the statute as constitutional and the court affirmed. The statute did not impermissibly interfere with the parish home rule charter because the power to appoint members of the GNOEC was not a power within the purview of charter and the charter's enabling provisions under La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 3(c) (1921) did not authorize inclusion of the appointive power within the charter. The enabling provisions related to governmental structure and organization and not to the powers granted to the GNOEC. The court held that the powers of the GNOEC were limited to those enumerated under La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 22(g) (1921) and that only the legislature could expand those powers. The court held that the statute was not a local law because no private interests were involved and advertisement was not required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer had defendant under surveillance based on information that defendant was selling drugs. The officer knew defendant was driving with a suspended license, and he saw defendant engage in what appeared to be a drug transaction.

The trial court denied the motions, and defendant pleaded guilty to charges of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and operating a motor vehicle with a suspended license in violation of La.

In affirming the judgments of the trial court, the court found that based on the officer's knowledge of appellant's prior criminal record regarding narcotics activity, and the officer's lengthy experience in narcotics investigations, the initial stop of was justified. A drug dog alerted on defendant's car, giving rise to probable cause to search. The search led to the discovery of narcotics. Thus, the trial court correctly denied the motion to suppress the evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant the former district attorney appealed from a judgment of the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Parish of Sabine (Louisiana), which favored plaintiff current district attorney in an action to recover two payments the former district attorney made to himself from funds that were paid to the district attorney's office for services it provided in the enforcement of child support obligations under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The current district attorney brought an action against the former district attorney for the return of funds the former district attorney paid to himself before he left office. The Office of the District Attorney received the money for services provided in the enforcement of child support payments. The former district attorney claimed the money was for earned but unpaid compensation. The current district attorney claimed that the payment was an illegal bonus because the district attorney's salaries were set by statute. On review the court held that the statutory fixing of district attorneys salaries and parish supplemental salaries was not meant to limit them to that amount of income for the performance of their duties, rather they were meant to instruct the State Treasurer and the parish governing authorities what should be paid. As to the specific payments made to the former district attorney, the court confined itself to the question of whether the funds were unauthorized bonuses. Notwithstanding the former official's claim that the payments were back salary, the court found that the claim was not sufficiently proven.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the judgment of the trial court to require the former district attorney to return only the sum that the current district attorney had requested, plus interest.

The judgment creditor petitioned the trial court to make the Nevada judgment executory, and the trial court granted the motion. The judgment debtor appealed and contended that the Nevada judgment was null and void because the foreign court lacked personal jurisdiction over him and full faith and credit should have been denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class members were employees of the New Orleans Fire Department consisting of fire alarm operators, dispatchers, and fire inspectors. They filed suit seeking compensation pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. art. 33:1992 and back pay for a period of three years. The trial court rendered judgment for the class members. The issue on appeal was whether the trial court's application of art. 33:1992 violated the constitutional authority to adopt a uniform pay plan granted the New Orleans Civil Service Commission in La. Const. art. 10, &sect; 10. The court reversed, finding that because the evidence was clear that the class members were receiving substantially more than the minimum pay, the trial court's interpretation of art. 33:1992 was tantamount to a legislative increase in civil service employees' wages in violation of La. Const. art. 6, &sect; 14. The court interpreted La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1992(A)(9) and (10) to mean that the minimum wage of a fire alarm dispatcher or operator, and the minimum wage of an inspector, had to be 25 percent above the state-required minimum wage of a fireman, as set forth in the statute, and not the wage the fireman actually received.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant was arrested on a drug charge, a bonding company, acting as agent for a surety, agreed to underwrite the bail bonds. As a condition for providing the bonds, defendant agreed to waive any rights to the bond premium if he was returned to jail. Later, after having been released from jail, defendant requested that he be returned to jail. Upon return, defendant filed an ex parte motion for refund of the bond premium paid to the bonding company. On the basis of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 338(D), which required a surety to refund a premium when a surety surrendered a defendant who had not failed to appear, a refund order was issued. The bonding company filed an application for writs when the trial court denied its motion for return of the premium, which it had deposited in court. The court ruled that the trial court erred in ordering the bonding company to refund the premium, explaining that under the statute it was the surety that must refund the premium, and the bonding company was not the surety, to whom the order should have been directed, but only its agent. As an agent was not the proper party to proceedings under art. 338(D), summary proceedings were improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second degree murder of his wife and sentenced to life imprisonment. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal. The court held that there was no evidence of a hostile or overt act by the victim at the time of the murder. Defendant had no cuts, marks, or other indications of any physical injury. Therefore, the testimony was properly excluded to show the victim's violent character. The court ruled that at worst, the exclusion was harmless error. The State proved that defendant was the aggressor in the altercation. The murder was not the result of sudden passion because he knew about the victim's infidelity approximately two months prior to the killing. Thus, his plea of self-defense or his motion to modify the verdict to the lesser-included offense of manslaughter was denied. Finally, the court concluded that the mitigating factors were not proven by a preponderance of the evidence. The evidence showed that defendant planned the murder and used gasoline to destroy evidence of the crime.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 23:1102C(1) as applied merely removed from defendants the option of compromising with plaintiff without the intervenor's approval and having a full trial on the merits at that point.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1940, the board appropriated, for the purposes of constructing a levee, certain servitudes or rights of way located on property owned by the landowners. A burrow pit was dug on a portion of the land. In 1941, the landowners were paid for the 21 acres of land. In 1977 construction companies began entering the land to prepare it to increase the size and strength of the levee. The landowners contended the companies were trespassing and they were entitled to damages. The court held that when the board had the burrow pit dug back in early 1940, it preserved its servitude over the entire tract of land, which never prescribed. As for the landowners argument that they were entitled to damages for expropriation, the court noted the landowners had already received compensation and they were not entitled to be paid for the same land again. The landowners' contention that they were entitled to recover damages for the recent cutting of timber and digging of burrows; the court held that those acts were simply an exercise of the board's rights obtained back in 1940. The trial court properly found that the board possessed the power to evict the tenant from the land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the court discussed the consolidated cases, the court only issued one decree. The trial court judgment which held that the board was within its power to evict the tenant from the land was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business owners initiated suit against the parish alleging that due to the parish's unconstitutional legislation they were precluded from engaging in their usual business activities resulting in lost profits, damage to their business reputation, and mental anguish. The parish filed an exception of no cause of action. The trial court granted judgment in the parish's favor. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that there was no authority for imposing liability upon a governmental entity for passing an ordinance which was subsequently found unconstitutional due to improper drafting, overbreadth, vagueness, or preemption by either state or federal law. The unconstitutional regulations were not unreasonable, per se, and did not deprive the business owners' of any basic federal constitutional rights. Moreover, the parish was immune form liability because the enactment of an ordinance was a legislative act and legislative acts of the parish could not be characterized as tortious, however mistaken or unwise they might be.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of one count of purse snatching. A multiple offender bill was filed and the trial court sentenced him to 40 years at hard labor as a third felony offender. On appeal, defendant's conviction was affirmed, but the matter was remanded for resentencing because defendant was only a second felony offender. On remand, he was resentenced to 40 years at hard labor. The court reversed and remanded for resentencing, finding that while purse snatching was a serious crime, and the trial court was correct in finding that because of defendant's past criminal record a long period of incarceration was required in order to effectively punish him and to protect the public, a term of imprisonment at hard labor for 40 years was excessive to achieve those goals. The court noted that the crime was not committed in the worst way, the defendant was not one of the worst offenders, the victim was not injured, nor was a large sum of money stolen. The court further found that because the defendant was only 20 years old when the offense was committed, his youth mitigated strongly in his favor and a sentence of no more than 25 years was more appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff crop duster sought review of a judgment from the 19th Judicial District Court, in and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which affirmed the decision of defendant Commissioner of Agriculture who had adopted the finding made by the Advisory Commission on Pesticides (ACP) that the crop duster had violated the Louisiana Pesticide Law (LPL), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3:3203.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The crop duster was the sole shareholder of a corporation, which was engaged in the business of the application of pesticides. Both he and his corporation had become the subjects of investigations and proceedings by the Department of Agriculture, the regulating agency responsible for issuing the certification and the license of the corporation. He was charged with the application of pesticides while his certification and license were suspended in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3:3252(A)(2). The court reversed in part and affirmed in part. The court held that when the corporation appealed a previous suspension of the corporation's license, the license suspension was delayed pending the appeal. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:961(B), however, did not serve to extend an expired license. Therefore, when the license expired during the appeal process, it was without a license. The court found that it was unfair for the department to circumvent the maximum penalty provision by bringing multiple charges for the same offense ,and reversed one of the charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed one charge of the judgment from the trial court and affirmed the three remaining charges, and the revocation of the crop duster's commercial applicator certificate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction after a jury trial in the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parrish of Jefferson, State of Louisiana, for theft of intellectual property under La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and an accomplice entered a competitor's business and made copies of software and documents for use in his own business. The court held that defendant's failure to raise a vagueness defense at trial waived the issue on appeal. A search warrant was properly executed and evidence seized was within the common sense of the scope of the warrant and properly admitted. Substantial evidence, including unauthorized entry, and the fact that copies of the programs, manuals, and software bearing a serial number linking it to the victim's software and found in the offices of defendant's new business, supported the conviction. The jury's failure to return verdict on a burglary charge did not compromise the theft verdict. The denial of a motion for a new trial based on allegations of witness sequestration violations was a proper exercise of the trial court's discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for theft of intellectual property because defendant failed to raise the issue of unconstitutional vagueness at trial, substantial direct and circumstantial evidence supported verdict, and the denial of a motion for a new trial was not an abuse of discretion. The sentence was amended to provide for credit for time served and, as amended, affirmed the sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with several crimes including two counts of manufacturing methamphetamine, manslaughter, possession of methamphetamine, and possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute. He pled guilty to two counts of manufacturing methamphetamine. He also pled guilty to possession of methamphetamine with an intent to distribute. After pleading guilty, the remaining charges were nolle pross'd. Defendant argued that the district court failed to comply with La. Code Crim. Proc. art 894.1, and erred by sentencing him to an excessive term of imprisonment. Defendant argued that the judge failed to state the reasons for sentence in violation of art. 894.1 and contended he took too lightly defendant's employment history, lack of a prior record, and lack of likelihood of recidivism. On review, the court held there was no abuse by the sentencing judge, as defendant's offenses occurred over a one-year span. In addition, defendant could have been sentenced up to 10 years on each count. Finally, the court noted that defendant was dealing with a very large volume of drugs.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A search of defendant's residence by deputies yielded 119.6 grams of cocaine. Defendant plead guilty in exchange for the district attorney nolle processing similar charges against defendant's wife. The trial court sentenced defendant to serve the minimum sentence, five years at hard labor plus a fine, in default of which he was to serve one year in a parish jail. The trial court suspended the prison term, and defendant was placed on three years supervised probation and given special conditions that he serve six months in the parish jail. Defendant argued that the trial court failed to articulate reasons for sentencing, and failed to consider certain mitigating factors; and challenged the sentence itself as excessive, and cruel and unusual punishment. On review, the court affirmed. The court determined that not only was defendant's sentence not excessively harsh under La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20, it was excessively lenient. The court found that defendant received the minimum sentence which was subsequently reduced so that he then, in essence, received a sentence below the minimum.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was subsequently arrested and convicted of negligent discharge of a firearm, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:94. On appeal, the court affirmed. Despite defendant's contrary contention, the court explained that the statute did not require that the discharge of the gun actually result in death or harm to another, but only that it was foreseeable that such might occur. Moreover, the statute was not &quot;void for vagueness,&quot; because a reasonable person could foresee the danger to life of shooting a gun in a populated area across a busy thoroughfare. The trial court did not erroneously rely upon the uncorroborated testimony of the business visitor, notwithstanding the contradictory testimony of defense witnesses, as he was the only witness to the firing and the others only stated that they did not hear a shot. Moreover, injury was foreseeable, given the neighbors, children, and traffic in the area.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Marijuana, cash, and financial records were seized from the claimant's home after officers purchased drugs from him several times.

Ann. &sect; 32:1550(A)(7)(c)&nbsp;unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof to him. The court found that this provision regarding factually innocent persons did not apply; thus, the issue was not before the court. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1356(A)(1) provided that all property used, intended for use, derived from, or realized through illegal drug sales was subject to civil forfeiture. The court found that the State met its burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the funds in the two savings accounts were derived from the sale of drugs. The claimant had a history of drug-related activities, numerous bank accounts in others' names, and no identifiable source of income as stated on his income tax returns. Also, the cash found in his home could not be traced to a legitimate source.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, plaintiffs, an unsuccessful candidate and a voter, appealed from judgments of the Civil District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which dismissed their petitions for mandamus. In their actions against defendants, a successful candidate, the commissioner of elections, the secretary of state, and the board of supervisors of elections, plaintiffs sought to have the election results overturned and a run-off declared.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three names appeared on the ballot for a school board election. One candidate withdrew from the race before the election. The withdrawn candidate received 787 votes, while the unsuccessful candidate received 5,920 votes. The successful candidate received 6,416 votes. The unsuccessful candidate argued that the withdrawn candidate's votes should have been considered, making the total number of votes cast 13,123 and a majority 6,561. Under this scheme, the successful candidate (with 6,416) would have fallen short of a majority and a runoff would have resulted. The voter, who cast his vote for the withdrawn candidate, argued he was deprived of the right to vote where the state failed to notify him of the withdrawal and failed to consider his vote in the total count. The district court dismissed the petitions. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:502 controlled. The effect of the withdrawal was that the votes could not be counted toward the majority. Because the withdrawal of the candidate was a matter of the public record, there was not further requirement to notify voters of the withdrawal, and the voter's constitutional right to vote was not abridged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant husband was granted a writ of certiori of the decision from the Family Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which dismissed his exception of lack of personal jurisdiction filed in response to the suit for alimony filed by plaintiff wife after the husband had moved out of state and obtained a judgment of divorce in another jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband moved out of state and obtained a divorce from the wife in the other jurisdiction. The wife then sued for alimony and argued that the Louisiana family court had jurisdiction under La. Rev. Stat.

The trial court granted the petition and the husband appealed. On review the court also noted that the long-arm statute could be applied to a nonresident who had minimum contacts with the state on the basis of an amendment to the statute. The court found that the former residency of the husband in the state was sufficient to satisfy the minimum contacts issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of Jefferson, State of Louisiana, which denied his motion for a severance of the offenses, which convicted him of attempted simple burglary and possession of a stolen car under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:62 and 14:69, and which sentenced him to respective, concurrent terms of six years and 20 years at hard labor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a friend drove a stolen car into a ditch, walked a half-mile to another car where the friend broke one of the car's window's while defendant kept a lookout, then walked away. As a result, defendant was convicted under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:62 and 14:69 of attempted simple burglary and illegal possession of a car worth more than $ 500, and was sentenced to six years at hard labor on the burglary charge and to 20 years at hard labor on the possession charge. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the two offenses were similar, were separated by less than a half hour in time and less than one mile in location, and there was no evidence that the jury was confused or that defendant was prejudiced by being tried for both offenses in one trial. Thus, the joinder of the offenses was proper under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 493 and defendant was not entitled to a severance of the offenses under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 495.1. Witnesses saw defendant getting out of the car in the ditch and standing by the other car. Thus, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:438, the circumstantial evidence and the direct evidence was sufficient to support the convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in all respects, but remanded the case to correct a clerical error because a minute entry erroneously showed that defendant was convicted of simple burglary instead of attempted simple burglary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant homebuilders complained of a judgment of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, State of Louisiana, which dismissed their exceptions of prematurity and of no cause of action that were directed toward plaintiff homeowners' redhibitory action brought under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2520 et seq. praying for rescission of the sale or alternatively damages because of alleged defects in a house.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homebuilders' exceptions were grounded in their contention that the homeowners' remedy was limited to that provided by Louisiana's New Home Warranty Act (NHWA), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:3141 et seq., rather than the redhibitory action. The homeowners contended that the trial court correctly dismissed the exceptions, and argued that because the codal provisions providing for the redhibitory action were part of the contract of sale, to interpret the NHWA so as to eliminate their redhibitory action or to require them to first give the homebuilders an opportunity to correct the defect, would be to give the NHWA retroactive effect and, hence, render it unconstitutional as an impairment of a contract obligation or the taking of a vested right. The court held that the NHWA was substantive because it changed the substantive provisions incorporated into the contract of sale, i.e., (1) the right to a rescission of the sale under a proper set of facts, and (2) the right to a rescission without first giving an opportunity to seller to repair the defects. La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2520, therefore, was the applicable law, and the exceptions were properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial judge and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the owner and operator of oil production leases, appealed the assessment of a fine against him by the Department of Environmental Quality (Louisiana). He argued that the oil and salt water discharges did not constitute pollutants, and the quantity of the spill did not give rise to notification requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department issued a compliance order to the owner of oil production leases for violations of the Environmental Quality Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 30:1091-1098. A civil penalty of $ 5000 was assessed. Upon the owner's request, an administrative hearing was held. The findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended penalty of the hearing officer were adopted, and the owner was assessed $ 56,000 in penalties. He appealed, and the court held that the statutes, rules, orders and regulations provided adequate qualitative and quantitative guidelines to determine which substances and quantities of substances constituted pollutants. It determined that the record supported the department's finding that the salt water and oil were discharged in sufficient quantities to pollute the environment. Further, the court held that the owner was required to report the oil spill. Yet as the factors constituting the basis for the amount of penalty were considered when the $ 5000 penalty was assessed, the court ruled that the hearing itself was the only basis for the $ 51,000 increase in the penalty assessment. As such, the penalty increase was arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the order to reinstate the original $ 5,000 penalty, and in all other respects, the matter was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded and held that if the state police were to be enjoined, the order must be fairly exact.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the State on behalf of the Louisiana Department of Health and Human Resources (DHHR), sought a reversal of a disposition of the Juvenile Court, Jefferson Parish, (Louisiana), which awarded joint legal custody of appellee, a juvenile adjudged delinquent, to DHHR and other state agencies. DHHR argued that it should be relieved of legal custody or any financial responsibility for the juvenile pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1580.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the juvenile was adjudicated as a delinquent, the juvenile court awarded legal custody of the juvenile to a state correctional agency. The disposition was modified to award legal custody jointly to DHHR and the agency. DHHR's appeal effectively acted as a stay order, but the juvenile court again modified the judgment. The juvenile court was divested of jurisdiction to render any further dispositions when DHHR appealed; thus, the court reviewed the first modification order. Once the juvenile court awarded legal custody of the juvenile to the agency, it had sole custody and the exclusive right to choose the appropriate placement, care, and treatment of the child as provided under La. Code Juv. Proc. Ann. arts. 84-86. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1580, DHHR only had authority to place a child in an appropriate facility where the child was initially referred to DHHR for treatment. The statutory scheme allowed for the possibility that DHHR could be awarded custody of a juvenile who had been adjudged delinquent, but it prohibited an award of joint custody of a juvenile to a private or public institution or agency.</SPAN></P>

She was sentenced to two year's imprisonment and court costs or 30 days additional imprisonment in default of payment. On appeal, the court noted that the sentence was illegally lenient because it did not impose the minimum fine prescribed by statute. Because the State did not address this error on appeal, it was waived. Defendant argued that she was erroneously convicted of being a third offender because her two predicate convictions had occurred on the same day. The court found that this argument had not merit. Further, defendant claimed that her sentence was excessive. The court noted that the sentence was the minimum allowed by statute. Finally, she contended that the jail term in default of payment of court costs was inappropriate because she was indigent. The court agreed with this contention. Accordingly, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence, but amended the sentence to delete the portion imposes jail time upon default.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with six counts of distributing marijuana and one count of distributing a false controlled dangerous substance. Defendant pleaded guilty to five counts of distributing marijuana. The remaining charges nolle prosequi'd. The trial court sentenced him to serve three years at hard labor for each count, concurrently. Defendant appealed, contending that the trial court failed to comply with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 and that his sentence was excessive. On review, the court held that defendant's sentence was not excessive and noted that the trial court had wide discretion in imposing the sentence. The court stressed that defendant could have received up to 10 years on each count, but received a sentence in the lower range of possible sentences. The court also found merit in defendant's assertion that the trial court failed to comply with art. 894.1. The trial court reviewed defendant's presentence report, but failed to consider his status as a first-time offender, his marriage and fatherhood, or his veteran status. However, the sentence was proper given the sentencing range, defendant's prior misdemeanor record, and the seriousness of the charges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the 16th Judicial District Court, Parish of Iberia (Louisiana) that convicted him of three counts of cocaine distribution in violation of La.

Ann. &sect; 40:967, arguing that the trial court erred in granting his motion for a new trial where a juror was unqualified, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction, and that his sentence was impermissibly excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of three counts of distribution of cocaine. He appealed his conviction and sentence. In affirming, the court rejected defendant's argument that his conviction should be reversed where it was subsequently discovered that a juror was functionally illiterate and, therefore, unqualified to act as a juror under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 401. Where the only written evidence submitted was read to the jury and where no written exhibits were taken into the jury deliberation room, defendant suffered no prejudice by the juror's illiteracy, and no error was committed, therefor, in denying his motion for a new trial. Likewise, defendant's evidentiary sufficiency challenge, premised upon the police officer's lack of credibility, failed as well. Determinations of witness credibility were vested in the finder of fact, the jury, and the jury's acceptance of the officer's testimony was within its discretion. The court also rejected defendant's challenge to his sentence. Where the sentencing range was not less than 5 years nor more than 30 years of incarceration, a sentence of 6 and 1/2 years on each count, running concurrently, was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of raping three of his children, aged 6 to 10 years. The trial judge sentenced defendant to life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence on each count, with the sentences to run consecutively. On appeal, defendant alleged several counts of error. Defendant alleged that the trial court incorrectly overruled five of his challenges for cause during jury selection. Defendant complained that five jurors were partial or biased, either because they were familiar with the family, were a district attorney or a policeman, or because someone in their family was involved in a rape case. The court held that the challenges were properly overruled, as each juror demonstrated a willingness and ability to be an unbiased, impartial juror and to make a decision based only on the law and the evidence. The court held that the trial court properly admitted the testimony of two of the children's foster parent as expert testimony. The court noted that bias did not preclude a witness from being qualified as an expert, but could be considered by the jury in deciding what weight to give the testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parish and the commission proposed to issue bonds to finance the cost of improving the sewer system. The taxpayer filed a motion to enjoin them from issuing and selling the bonds and for a declaratory judgment that the local service agreements were illegal. The trial court granted the taxpayer's motion for judgment, finding that the resolution and intergovernmental agreement were unconstitutional. The parish and the commission appealed to the supreme court, which transferred the case for an expedited hearing. The court noted that without the annual contribution of the parish, the sewer user fees were insufficient to meet the project costs and the debt service. As there was no evidence in the record identifying the exact source for the parish's contribution, the court held that the contribution was derived from other funds and was not legally available for this purpose. To the extent that the resolution required the illegal use of this money, it constituted a charge upon other income and revenues of the Parish in violation of La. Const. art. 6, &sect; 37, making the resolution invalid.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, while it was error for the trial court to fail to instruct itself as to the elements of negligent homicide, the failure was not prejudicial. The court noted that the trial court, as the trier of fact, had sufficient information to understand that if one defendant was guilty only of negligent homicide, that defendant would be found not guilty of manslaughter. The court held that the record supported the trial court's finding that both defendants were guilty of manslaughter.

The court held that defendant was not entitled to good time credits under La. Rev. Stat.

In affirming defendant's sentence, the court noted that the acquittal involved the same basic modus operandi as defendant alleged in this case. The court held that despite the acquittal, the fact of the prior arrest was a relevant and permissible aggravating factor at sentencing. The court also held that defendant's sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive, noting that the trial court had considered the La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 sentencing guidelines and specifically his prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon that derived from a similar assault and other assaults on women for which defendant had been arrested. As for the conviction, the court held that defendant's ineffective assistance claim was not reviewable on the record, and that his claims of error in rulings on various motions, the admission of evidence, and closing argument were all without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Fifteenth Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of Lafayette (Louisiana) denied relator eye surgeon's motion to quash an indictment charging him with 37 counts of computer fraud, violations of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:73.5, the court granted a writ of certiorari in order to fully consider the surgeon's claim that &sect; 14:73.5 was unconstitutional under the United States Constitution and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The surgeon was charged with computer fraud with respect to his computerized billing. On appeal, the court held that, because the indictment charged computer fraud by using language similar to &sect; 14:73.5, the surgeon had standing to raise the issue of the constitutionality of &sect; 14:73.5. But, because &sect; 14:73.5 did not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct, his overbreadth challenge had to fall. However, the court held that, under the definition of &quot;access&quot; in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:73.1(1), unlawful conduct could involve only incidental access or use of a computer and remain within the broad parameters of the conduct proscribed by &sect; 14:73.5. Therefore, the definition of &quot;access&quot; set forth in &sect; 14:73.1(1) was unconstitutionally vague insofar as an accused could be subject to prosecution without any awareness that access to a computer had taken place. Likewise, the meaning of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:73.5(A)(2) was vague as to what conduct was proscribed, because there was no mens rea required to violate &sect; 14:73.5(A)(2). Because the unconstitutionally vague definition of &quot;access&quot; was applicable throughout &sect; 14:73.5, the entire statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court made the writ peremptory, reversed the trial court's ruling, and granted the eye surgeon's motion to quash the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Thirty-First Judicial District Court, Jefferson Davis Parish (Louisiana), which sentenced him to four years at hard labor on his conviction for attempted simple burglary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a large burglary of a farm warehouse, several co-defendants pled guilty to burglary in exchange for three-year prison terms if they would testify against defendant. On review from the judgment on a jury verdict finding defendant guilty of only attempted burglary, defendant argued that the four-year prison sentence imposed by the district court was excessive because the jury convicted him only of attempt, he was a first time offender, and several co-defendants received lighter sentences. The court affirmed the sentence and held that: (1) the district court judge had sufficiently articulated his findings for sentencing under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1(A); (2) any suggestion that the jury's responsive verdict mandated a lesser sentence was without merit because it misstated the role of judge and jury under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 790; and (3) any sentence received by a co-defendant as the result of a plea bargain indicated that the co-defendant was more likely to be rehabilitated. The court reasoned that to require a judge to impose an equal or lesser sentence on defendant would discourage the effective use of plea-bargaining.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted that the victim engaged in consensual sex. The court affirmed the judgment, rejecting defendant's contention that the trial court erred in denying his motion for post-verdict judgment of acquittal. The court found that a rational jury could have found defendant guilty of sexual battery beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also concluded that the trial court did not err in allowing the State to present a rebuttal witness who testified as to the true circumstances surrounding defendant's prior conviction for simple battery. Because defendant's testimony denied the sexual nature of the previous attack, the court found that the testimony of the victim of the previous attack became a justifiable impeachment tool. The court held that notice of the State's intent to use the prior conviction was not required because the prior conviction was used for impeachment purposes. Finally, the court concluded that imposition of the maximum sentence was warranted by defendant's conduct.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed and alleged error in the trial court's denial of defendant's motion in limine to exclude the statement as to the decapitation. The court affirmed the conviction and held that defendant did not have the right to exclude the statement because the statement was necessary to prove the elements of manslaughter and contained no mention of other crimes. The court held that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his constitutional rights on each of the three occasions when he gave a statement regarding the incident. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction because defendant's statement was corroborated by evidence of blood in the galley and the captain's clothes in the water.</SPAN></P>

Defendant found the victim, handcuffed him, and placed him in defendant's automobile. Although defendant did not dispute that the victim was shot a short time later, there was conflicting evidence as to the circumstances leading to the shooting. Defendant contended that he shot the victim after he jumped from the car and began fleeing. The victim testified that defendant pushed him from the moving vehicle, and that as he was getting to his feet, he was shot. The victim denied trying to escape and maintained that he was shot from a distance of about 10 yards, while defendant testified that the victim was 200 to 500 meters away when he shot him. The court found that the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intentionally shot the victim three times without provocation, while the victim was handcuffed.

Defendants claimed that La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The OWCA recommended defendants be required to pay the laborer temporary total disability benefits until he was physically able to return to gainful employment.

The district court granted the laborer's motion for summary judgment. Defendants appealed arguing that &sect; 23:1310.1 because the OWCA recommendation process did not require a hearing, the statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed finding that although the statutory scheme did not provide for a hearing prior to issuance of the recommendation, defendants had the right to negate the recommendation by simply completing a form within 30 days. In addition, the administrative procedure was subject to judicial review under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1311(A) which further met due process requirements. The statutory scheme also provided for de novo consideration and appellate review; under La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Criminal District Court for the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) on two counts of armed robbery and one count of aggravated rape. He was sentenced to concurrent 50 year terms on each armed robbery count and to life imprisonment for the aggravated rape. Defendant appealed his convictions and alleged error concerning jury selection, statutory overbreadth, jury instructions, and admissibility of evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that his case should have severed in order to preserve his right to peremptory challenge. He argued deprivation of the right when co-defendant peremptorily rejected jurors who were acceptable to defendant. However, he had no vested right to shield certain jurors from another's challenge. Defendant next argued error in the denial of his motion to quash La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42(A)(5) on grounds of unconstitutional overbreadth. He alleged it criminalized &quot;group sex&quot; by creating a presumption that an act of intercourse was without the victim's consent when more than two people were participating. The court disagreed.The statute clearly defined the crime as &quot;rape&quot; committed under specified circumstances. Also, it was generally inappropriate to invalidate a statute for overbreadth when it affected conduct rather than speech. Defendant also argued error in the jury charge concerning La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42(A)(3). Yet, the charge correctly stated the law and adequately explained the burden of proof. In light of the evidence, the jury could have reasonably concluded defendant knew co-defendant was using a gun and thereby aided him in committing aggravated rape.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the jury instructions erroneously defined &quot;contemporary community standards,&quot; included the word &quot;lustful&quot; in the definition of &quot;prurient interest,&quot; and failed to address a diversionary agreement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the owner of an adult bookstore, was convicted of obscenity after officers obtained certain pornographic videos from his store. The court found that numerous errors with respect to the jury instructions were committed by the trial court.

The court held that language which included no reference to a particular geographic area would have been acceptable. The court also found that the language did not make reference to particularly liberal or susceptible persons living within the community. The term &quot;lustful&quot; was used in the jury instructions, but the trial court failed to instruct the jury that obscenity excluded a normal, healthy, wholesome interest in sex. The trial court also erred when it failed to give a requested limiting instruction on the use of a diversionary agreement which was entered into by defendant after officers obtained the first of the three videos. An officer, testifying that defendant had breached the agreement, stated that the materials sold by defendant were obscene.</SPAN></P>

The defendant also challenged his sentence. The appeals court affirmed the defendant's conviction and sentence. First, the court held that the statutes were presumed to be valid, and the constitutionality of a statute should be upheld whenever possible. Because a state statute was presumed constitutional, the party challenging the statute had the burden of proving its unconstitutionality.&nbsp;Section 14:62.4 was constitutional because it was a derivative of section 14:62, which was found constitutional. The court further held that the statute was not vague because it fully described the term business and because no person of ordinary intelligence would consider a state employment office in any other capacity than a place of business. The defendant's sentence was not excessive because the defendant had prior convictions for burglary and had served time in prison. The sentence was within the statutory range.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that the aggravated rape statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42, and the forcible rape statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat.

The court held that the legislature had determined the punishment for each offense and the jury determined which verdict was appropriate after reviewing the evidence on the amount of force employed. The court also held that the trial court properly disallowed the defense to question defendant's friend who had accompanied him to the victim's trailer on the night of the rape, as to his prior sexual conduct with the victim as bearing on the consent of the victim and prohibited by the rape-shield statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:498.

Contrary to defendant's assertion, the sentence imposed was not handed down solely to discourage others from criminal activity. Rather, the trial court considered the aggravating and mitigating factors. Defendant was a first offender who pleaded guilty and who suggested he was remorseful. Defendant was also a family man with five children and imprisonment would have worked a hardship on his family. Among the aggravating factors, however, was the fact that defendant was transporting a significant quantity of marijuana, 75 pounds, and the fact that the trial judge believed that defendant might have again become involved in criminal activity if the sentence did not serve as a deterrent.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. He admitted that the testimony of the victim, if believed, would have been sufficient, but contended that her testimony contained enough inconsistencies to discredit her. The court was not in a position to assess the credibility of a witnesses. The testimony of the victim was sufficient to establish the essential elements of the offense, as she graphically described the activity engaged in, which included the necessary acts. Defendant also alleged that life imprisonment was excessive because force, threats, or violence were not involved, and because his older brother initiated the activity. Even if his brother was the first of the child's uncles to rape her, defendant willingly engaged in the activity numerous times over a lengthy period. Also, the child, under 12, was not capable of consenting; thus, the use of force, violence, or threats was not necessary for aggravated rape. Further, perpetration of the offense by one related by such a close degree of consanguinity was especially offensive to society. Lastly, compared with the sentencing statutes of other states, the statute was not facially excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of contraband in a penal institution. The law utilized for the prosecution was La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:402(C) [prior to amendment by 1986 La. Acts 989]. On appeal, the court rejected the argument that &sect; 14:402(C) was unconstitutional. The basis for the argument of unconstitutionality was that there was a violation of the La. Const. art. 2, &sect; 2 because items prohibited could be authorized by the officer in charge of the respective institution. The court also rejected the argument that there was erroneous admission of prejudicial testimony by a deputy. He testified that two pieces of wire were found beneath defendant's mattress and that they could have been used as a dangerous weapon. He also testified about an occurrence in which he was injured by a prisoner other than defendant. Generally, a witness could testify only as to facts within his knowledge and not as to any opinion he had. According to the court, because defendant objected to the deputy's qualifications to give testimony about the wire's possible uses as a dangerous weapon, it was appropriate to admit evidence that established the basis of the deputy's personal observations.</SPAN></P>

While on probation, a warrant was issued for his arrest but was not executed until after the probationary period had expired.

Defendant applied for supervisory writs, contending that under La. Code Crim. Proc.

The court found that art. 899D was clear in its statement that the probationary period was suspended by the issuance of an arrest warrant. The court further found that reasonable efforts were made to execute the warrant and the main reason the warrant was not executed was because of defendant's moving; therefore, art. 899D, as written and applied to defendant, did not deprive defendant of liberty without due process of law in violation of U.S. Const. amend.

Ann. &sect; 42:1411 was not unconstitutional because it did not provide a method of removal from public office which was not provided for in the state constitution. Furthermore, the court found that &sect; 42:1411 was properly applied to the school board member because an act in a prior term of office may furnish the grounds for removal during a subsequent term.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, in and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, State of Louisiana, which convicted him of molestation of a juvenile, in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was defendant's niece, who was six years old at the time of the incidents. The victim's parents were divorced and she lived with her mother and step-father in Texas. The offenses occurred while the victim and her younger sister were visiting their father, defendant's brother. Defendant was convicted and sentenced to concurrent terms of seven years at hard labor for each conviction. Defendant sought review arguing that the trial court erred by requiring that defendant be screened from the victim's view during her testimony. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the trial court had not erred in finding that the victim was competent to testify because the determination that a child witness was competent to testify was based not only upon the child's answers to questions testing his understanding but also on the child's overall demeanor on the witness stand. The court found that during the hearing to determine her competency, the victim testified that she knew what it meant to tell the truth and that she knew what a lie is. The court ruled that the testimony of the victim was sufficient to establish the elements of the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, school director, sought review of a decision of the Commission on Ethics for Public Employees (Louisiana), which found that he had violated La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 42:1112A and 42:1116, imposed a fine of $ 5,000, and ordered him demoted from his position as school director.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school director was appointed to his position on the condition that he obtain a master's degree. He enlisted the assistance of a subordinate employee at the school in typing and editing papers that he was required to submit in pursuit of a master's degree. When the subordinate advised him that the typing and editing work was taking too much of her time, and that she was not competent at using a memory typewriter, the school director paid his secretary at the school to finish the work during school hours and using school equipment. The Ethics Commission found that the school director violated La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 42:1112A and 42:116. The court held that the finding of a violation of &sect; 42:1116 was manifestly erroneous because the subordinate who initially typed and edited the papers was not compelled or coerced into doing the work. However, the court affirmed a finding that the school director participated in a transaction in which he had a personal substantial economic interest involving the governmental entity, and thus violated La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:1112A. Because the conduct was not expressly prohibited, the court reduced the penalty to a $ 1,500 fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Ethics Commission's decision was affirmed insofar as it found that the school director participated in a transaction in which he had a personal substantial economic interest involving the governmental entity by which he was employed, but amended the judgment to reduce the penalty to a fine of $ 1,500, and reversed the remainder of the decision.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the owners complained that their assessments were unequal and not uniform relative to assessments of similar classes of property in adjacent assessment districts. Thus, the court determined that their complaint was a correctness challenge. As such, the owners were obliged to follow the procedures mandated by La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 18 and provided for in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1998: suit must be filed within 30 days of the decision of the tax commission. Yet the owners failed to file their petitions timely.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with armed robbery at an incident that occurred at a bus stop. Defendant was picked out of a photographic line-up. Defendant's first trial for armed robbery ended in a mistrial. Defendant was convicted of two counts of armed robbery on the second trial. Defendant was sentenced to serve 13 years of hard labor on each count without the benefit of parole. The trial judge set aside the original sentence and sentenced defendant as a habitual offender. The trial court held that the minimum statutory sentence was unconstitutionally excessive. The court granted the State's writ application and vacated the sentence. The trial court then resentenced defendant. On review, the court found that the enhanced penalties imposed under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529 did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The court stated that the trial judge erred in imposing the first sentence because it was lesser than the sentence mandated by Louisiana law. The court determined that the officer's testimony regarding similar robberies did not foster a conclusion that defendant was being sought for any crimes other than those for which he was standing trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Fifteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Vermilion, State of Louisiana, which convicted defendant of forcible rape, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42.1, and sentenced defendant as an habitual offender to 60 years at hard labor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he was entitled to a mistrial because the court clerk at the arraignment mentioned that defendant was present with court-appointed counsel. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's denial of a mistrial was not erroneous because the clerk's statement did not amount to a prosecutorial attempt to argue guilt from poverty. The court determined that the victim's testimony was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a rape occurred and that defendant was the rapist. Although defendant was not informed when he pleaded guilty to forgery that the guilty plea could be used as the basis for the filing of a future multiple offender bill, the court ruled that the prior forgery conviction provided a sufficient basis for the multiple offender bill. The court concluded that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1) of Louisiana's Habitual Offender Law was not unconstitutionally vague because the only interpretation that a person of ordinary intelligence could make of &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1) was that a second felony offender's sentence would be not less than one-third the longest term and not more than twice the longest term prescribed for a first conviction.</SPAN></P>
