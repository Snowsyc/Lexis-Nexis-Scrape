</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee was seriously injured at work. He filed suit against respondent employer to recover damages for his injuries. The trial court dismissed the action, concluding that the action was barred by the Workers' Compensation Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 8306, &sect; 3, 3(a), and 5, because the statute was the exclusive remedy available to appellant. Appellant sought review of the decision, claiming that the dual capacity doctrine was applicable to his claim and that art. 8306, &sect; 3, 3(a), and 5 were unconstitutional. The court affirmed, concluding that the dual capacity doctrine did not permit appellant to maintain a separate suit against respondent because the Act was the sole remedy available to an injured worker and the dual capacity doctrine had been consistently rejected by the Texas courts. Further, the court concluded that art. 8306, &sect; 3, 3(a), and 5 did not deprive appellant of his due process rights because he did not have a vested right in the common law remedies that the Act extinguished. Lastly, the court concluded that the Act did not violate the open court's provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee mother of deceased 19-month-old baby filed an action for wrongful death and medical malpractice against appellant hospital. The evidence showed that appellant's nurses failed to follow doctor's orders in treating the deceased, which caused his death. The jury found appellant hospital liable. The court affirmed and held that under Tex. R. Civ. P. 327(b) and Tex. R. Civ. Evid. 606(b), an article that the jury read during deliberations, which discussed trial events, did not constitute an &quot;outside influence.&quot; The court further held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing an undisclosed expert witness to testify because good cause was shown and because there was no surprise. Additionally, the court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to consider appellant's supplemental motion for new trial where it was filed late. The court also held that there was some evidence to support the finding of gross negligence and exemplary damages and that matters of pain and suffering were necessarily speculative, and therefore, were particularly within the province of the jury to resolve.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was charged by information with violating Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect; 104.01(5) (Supp. 1989). According to the information, while appellant was employed by a person authorized to sell beer on premises licensed under the laws of Texas, she permitted an intoxicated person to remain on the licensed premises.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found appellant guilty of violating Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect; 104.01(5) (Supp. 1989) in that, as an employee of a person licensed to sell beer, she permitted an intoxicated person to remain on the premises. Appellant argued that the information did not allege facts sufficient to give her precise notice of the offense with which she was charged. Specifically, the term &quot;permit&quot; did not adequately describe how she committed the offense or what conduct was required to prevent commission of the crime. The court concluded, however, that the information contained all the constituent elements of the offense and that it was obvious that the gravamen of the offense was not removing an intoxicated person from the premises. The court ruled that a determination of how one would accomplish the result was evidentiary, and need not be alleged in the information. In affirming the conviction, the court also ruled that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it used ordinary terms to express ideas that could be interpreted with reasonable certainty by a person of ordinary intelligence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Criminal Appeals (Texas), vacated the court's affirmance of defendant's conviction of burglary of a motor vehicle because the conviction was upheld based on an unconstitutional parole jury charge given under Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of burglary of a motor vehicle, found one enhancement paragraph true and assessed punishment. The trial court gave the statutory parole instruction under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4. The trial judge ended the instruction, however, with an admonishment not to consider the manner in which the parole law could be applied to a particular defendant. Though defendant's conviction was initially affirmed on appeal, the affirmance was vacated and the case remanded to the court when the statutory instruction was declared unconstitutional. On remand, the court was directed to consider whether defendant was harmed by the unconstitutional parole charge. In light of defendant's prior criminal record and the curative instruction given by the trial court, which was re-emphasized by both the prosecution and defendant, the court held, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant suffered no harm as a result of the parole charge; the presumption that the jury followed the trial judge's instructions to disregard parole was not rebutted by the record. Defendant's conviction was thus affirmed on remand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant perpetrator forced his way into victim's apartment, brandishing a revolver. He raped and then forced victim into a closet. While appellant gathered items to steal, victim escaped. Appellant pled guilty to a jury to the offenses of aggravated sexual assault and aggravated robbery. He was sentenced. The court affirmed the lower court's conviction because it was not necessary for the lower court to admonish appellant's wife about her right not to testify against her husband. Also, she testified voluntarily. The court held that sergeant responses did not naturally and inevitably refer to any extraneous offense and the jury could have reasonably concluded that when the sergeant dealt with appellant, he was already in jail on this charge. Appellant's counsel purposely did not specify appellant's objections nor did appellant request an instruction to disregard that testimony.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant moved for a rehearing, arguing that the court erred in affirming the 181st Judicial District Court, Potter County (Texas), decision because Texas law did not permit the appointment of joint managing conservators without joint written agreement on the date of commencement of this suit and because legislative amendments to Tex. Fam. Code Ann. ch. 14 regarding appointment of joint managing conservators could not be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought a rehearing to challenge the court's earlier ruling regarding retroactive application of Tex. Fam. Code Ann. ch. 14 amendments. Appellant argued, among other things, that by holding that the amendments could be applied to a suit already pending at the time of their adoption took away or impaired a vested right belonging to appellant at such time. The court overruled appellant's motion for rehearing .The right of appellant to be considered for appointment by the district court as sole managing conservator was not taken away or impaired by the amendments here in question. The entitlement of appellant to be sole managing conservator would not become fixed or vested within the constitutional purview until and unless she was so appointed by the court. Such an appointment had not occurred by the effective date of the amendments. The court's interpretation did not deprive or impair of any vested right of appellant and did not violate either statutory or constitutional limitations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the District Court of Dallas County (Texas), which convicted him of aggravated sexual assault of two children under 14. The issue before the court on remand was whether the trial court's submission of an unconstitutional good time and parole instruction to the jury contributed to the jury's assessment of his punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted in two cases of aggravated sexual assault of a child under 14. On appeal to the court, appellant argued that the trial court erred in submitting good time and parole instructions to the jury because the charge was predicated on an unconstitutional statute. The court rejected the constitutional challenge. Appellant then petitioned for discretionary review. The court of criminal appeals granted the petition, holding that the statute at issue was unconstitutional, and remanded the case for a harm analysis. On remand, the court considered whether the unconstitutional parole instruction contributed to the punishment assessed. The court determined that there was a rebuttable presumption that the jury followed the trial court's curative instruction, and the court found that there was nothing in the case to rebut the presumption. The court further concluded that submission of the instruction and the jury's consideration of the instruction did not contribute to the jury's assessment of appellant's punishment. The court held that the error made no contribution to the punishment assessed and thus affirmed appellant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of attempted capital murder. The jury made a finding of use of a deadly weapon. Appellant sought review, arguing that the deadly weapon finding should be deleted from the judgment because he had no notice respondent state would seek the finding and he was thus denied his right to know when his parole eligibility would begin, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 42.12, &sect; 3g(a)(2); 42.18, &sect; 8(b). The court affirmed, holding that the witness's testimony that appellant told him that he shot the police officer because he did not want to go back to jail was not erroneously admitted as an extraneous offense, because the testimony provided the jury with an explanation for the shooting. The court found that the submission to the jury of appellant's parole charge under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a) which had been ruled unconstitutional, did not contribute to appellant's punishment, because the trial court instructed the jury not to consider the charge in assessing punishment.

The trial court entered judgment, but refused to award appellant pre-judgment interest on the amount of money it overpaid appellees pursuant to the finding of the special commissioner. Both parties appealed. The appellate court affirmed, holding that the value of appellees' property did not include the &quot;goodwill&quot; or &quot;going concern&quot; of is business. Relying on precedent, the appellate court held that the value of appellees' business was not a relevant concern in a taking of their real property. The appellate court also affirmed the denial of prejudgment interest to appellant.

Finally, the court held that appellee had not violated Tex. Loc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant flew a planeload of cocaine into the country after he had earlier flown in marijuana. The trial court instructed the jury about the sentence for delivery of controlled substance, gave curative instruction and told the jury not to consider the extent to which good time be awarded or forfeited or the manner in which the parole law might be applied. The court of criminal appeals recited that appellant argued the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the law concerning good time and parole because the charge was based upon an unconstitutional statute,&nbsp;Tex.

The court further held that art. 4476-15, &sect; 3.10(a) was not unconstitutionally void for vagueness because it gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of the substances that were treated as controlled substances. Finally, the court held that appellant could not question Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 2.09 because he had not been charged or convicted under that statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Texas corporation sought review of the decision of the 38th District Court of Uvalde County (Texas), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee administrator of estate and successor in interest of an Ohio company after appellee filed a notice of filing a foreign judgment and affidavit of filing a foreign judgment pursuant to the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 35.001 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee administrator of estate and successor in interest of an Ohio company filed suit against appellant Texas corporation in Ohio. A default judgment was entered. A judgment nunc pro tunc was later entered which changed appellant's name to its actual business name. Appellee then filed in Texas a notice of filing a foreign judgment pursuant to the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 35.001 et seq. Appellant filed a petition to set aside the foreign judgment and an application to stay the judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee and the court affirmed. The court held that appellee satisfied the requirements of the Ohio service of process rule. The court also held that there were sufficient minimum contacts to satisfy the requirements of due process and entitle the judgment to full faith and credit. The court held that appellant was not misled by appellee having the wrong name on the original case as appellant was the only target of the suit. Finally, the court held it could not pass upon the validity of &sect; 35.001 et seq. because appellant failed to show that he was injured by its operation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment in favor of appellee administrator of estate and successor in interest of an Ohio company and held that appellee satisfied the requirements of the Ohio service of process rule, there were sufficient minimum contacts to satisfy due process and entitle the Ohio judgment to full faith and credit in Texas, and it was unnecessary to determine if the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act was valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of promoting obscene material. He argued that the trial court erred in refusing to give him ten days after the criminal information was amended to prepare and file written pleadings. The court agreed, reversed, and remanded for a new trial. The court held that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 27.11 (1966) afforded defendant ten full days in which to familiarize himself with the charges that the information recited against him so that he could respond to those charges appropriately. The court held that when appellee state modified those charges by amending the information, defendant was still entitled to the full ten-day period to examine the amended charges and to prepare and file any necessary pleadings. Further, the court held that the information was amended not, as appellee contended, when the trial court granted its motion to amend, but later when the information itself was changed by the addition of certain words. The court reasoned that the actual amendment controlled because, under article 27.11, defendant would not have had notice of the amended charges against him until the wording of the charges was physically changed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant picketed a place of business, carrying a sign with an anti-abortion message on it. His picketing and haranguing induced a deliveryman to avoid the main walkway, and make his delivery to the business by cutting across the lawn. Defendant was arrested and convicted under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.03 (1974) for obstructing an entrance to a place of business to which the public had access. On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 42.03 was unconstitutional and that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. The court affirmed. The court held that state had the right to regulate the use of city streets and other facilities to assure the safety and convenience of people in their use, that this right constituted a compelling state interest, and that &sect; 42.03, consequently, did not encroach on defendant's rights under U.S. Const. amend. I. The court also rejected defendant's argument that, under &sect; 42.03, he had not received a proper order to move out of the way. The court held that the statute required that such an order could be given by any affected person, including the deliveryman who, in no uncertain terms, told defendant to move away from him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a city and its sign administrator, challenged the order of the 281st District Court Harris County (Texas), which entered judgment awarding appellee billboard owner damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, based on a jury finding that appellants had effected an unconstitutional taking of appellee's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a city and its sign administrator, had admittedly misinterpreted the city's sign ordinance by erroneously noticing a deadline for taking down billboards. After the error was acknowledged, appellants refused to allow appellee billboard owner to erect new signs, resulting in the destruction of appellee's business. Appellee brought suit under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The trial court awarded damages based on a jury finding that appellants had effected an unconstitutional taking of property. The court modified the amount of the judgment and otherwise affirmed. The issue was whether the error which damaged appellee constituted an official &quot;policy&quot; sufficiently to give rise to municipal liability under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court defined this issue as whether appellee sign administrator qualified as a policymaker, reasoning that if appellee administrator's conduct failed to qualify as execution of official policy, appellee city could not be liable under &sect; 1983 for his actions. The court held that government policy could be executed by an administrator whose acts represented official policy, and that the acts of the city sign administrator fairly represented official policy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the amount of damages awarded appellee billboard owner and otherwise affirmed the judgment. Appellants, a city and its sign administrator, violated appellee's civil rights by unconstitutionally taking their property through acts which fairly represented municipal policy, even though carried out by appellant administrator in error.</SPAN></P>

After the legislature amended the Free Port Law, Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 11.01(d) (1982), appellant paid the taxes on its property in full for everything other than the tea. The attorney general later found the Free Port Law unconstitutional. Appellant then tendered checks for the principal taxes assessed on the tea. Appellee county refused the tender because it did not include penalty and interest. The trial court found in favor of appellee and appellant challenged the judgment. The court reversed and remanded the cause back to the trial court for computation of penalty and interest due together with the assessed tax on appellant's tea stock and inventory only.

The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the statute did not violate the section of the Texas Constitution prohibiting incarceration in the penitentiary unless on an indictment of a grand jury because the petition by which appellant was charged with delinquency functioned as an indictment. The court rejected appellant's equal protection and equal rights arguments as premature, holding that appellant's transfer to the Texas Department of Corrections would occur, if at all, only after a hearing and a court order. The court held that the determinate sentence statute, under which appellant was sentenced, was enacted to provide for the care, the protection, and the wholesome moral, mental, and physical development of children.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found appellant guilty of burglary of a building and assessed his punishment to a life prison term based on his plea of true to three enhancements.

Although the trial court gave the jury an instruction on parole law that was held to be unconstitutional, the court found that the error was harmless. Noting that the trial court gave a curative instruction, the court found that appellant's prior criminal record, the weapon found near him at his arrest, testimony about his reputation, and the seriousness of the offense clearly supported the punishment assessed by the jury.

Tax Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 33.44 -33.54 to recover the delinquent taxes that appellant was attacking as invalid in his action. The trial court granted appellee summary judgment in its action. The issue on appeal was whether the trial court could render final judgment in appellee's &sect; 33 action for delinquent taxes, while appellant's &sect; 42 action, protesting the appraised values upon which those taxes were calculated, was still pending. The court noted that there was no express statutory bar to recovery of delinquent taxes in a taxing unit's &sect; 33 suit against a property owner whose &sect; 42 action, challenging those taxes, was pending; but held that the Tax Code implied that a judgment could not be recovered in the &sect; 33 suit until the &sect; 42 suit had been finally determined.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the 339th District Court, Harris County (Texas), in which a jury found appellant guilty of robbery and assessed an enhanced sentence at life imprisonment. Appellant argued that the indictment was incomplete, that he did not receive a speedy trial, that a prior statement was erroneously excluded, and that he had ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted by a jury of robbery. Based on prior convictions, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. The court affirmed the conviction and rejected each of appellant's arguments. The indictment, which was properly read aloud to the jury, was not required to allege the exact words of the aggravated robbery statute; it was sufficient because it charged appellant with the crime and stated every essential element of it. The Speedy Trial Act had been held unconstitutional by Texas courts; in any event, delays to appellant's trial were attributable to agreed resettings and were therefore waived. Appellant's argument that his counsel failed to require the state to make a prior statement available for cross-examination had no factual basis in the record. Counsel's decision not to call two witnesses did not support appellant's ineffective assistance of counsel argument because it was an isolated act and there was no showing that but for the decision the verdict would have been different. The evidence was sufficient to prove the sequence of appellant's prior felony convictions based on admission of a penitentiary packet; thus the sentence enhancement was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the jury verdict. The robbery indictment, properly read aloud by the prosecutor, charged appellant with the offense and stated all elements of the crime. The Speedy Trial Act had been declared unconstitutional. Other factors that caused delay were attributable to appellant's own resettings. Isolated acts of counsel, such as refusal to call certain witnesses, did not meet the ineffective assistance standard.</SPAN></P>

The court set aside its order staying the Court of Inquiry hearing, and overruled relator's petition for mandamus. The court did not have jurisdiction to consider the petition because no evidence had yet been presented in support of the hearing, and the court could not render an advisory opinion on an unripe factual situation that may or may not arise in the future. Respondent's order was not void for cause because it stated good cause in support of convening the hearing. The court could not address whether respondent was disqualified from presiding at the hearing because there was an earlier hearing involving recusal and the court did not have the outcome of the hearing in the record before it, and relator had a method of appeal from that hearing if he did not agree with the outcome.

Appellant argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and that the trial court erred in refusing to quash the information and in allowing the prosecutor to misstate the charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of driving and operating a motor vehicle in a public place while intoxicated under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 67011-1 &sect; (a) 2 (A) (Vernon Supp. 1989). His argument that the statute was unconstitutionally vague was not adopted by the court, which observed that the statute gave adequate notice of the prohibited conduct and did not have to specify what substances were forbidden. Appellant moved to quash the information based on the state's alleged failure to allege how he was intoxicated, but because the record did not show a ruling on the precise question of which intoxicant the state alleged, the error was not preserved for appeal. Defects in the form of the information would not render it defective absent prejudice to appellant's substantial rights. The record made it clear that the state would charge him for excess alcohol consumption and hence appellant was able to prepare an adequate defense. The prosecutor's misstatements about the charge were not preserved for appeal because the trial judge made no ruling about excluding them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the jury verdict. The statute, which focused not on what substance was introduced into the body but on the conduct of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, was not unconstitutionally vague. Possible errors, including denial of the motion to quash the information and prosecutor's misstatement of the charge, were not preserved for appeal.</SPAN></P>

Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 17.151. The state indicted defendant after the habeas writ issued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested in June 1988. In September 1988, she was charged with capital murder. In December 1988, defendant filed for writ of habeas corpus. Before the court ordered her release on the habeas corpus appeal, the state split defendant's capital murder charge into murder and aggravated kidnapping. The trial court granted bond on the murder charge only. By the time state obtained indictments defendant had been in custody for 249 days before the murder indictment and 261 days before the aggravated kidnapping indictment. Defendant sought a writ of mandamus to compel respondent trial court to release her on the personal recognizance bond ordered by the court in the habeas proceeding. The court held pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 17.151, defendant must be released on bond. The court held by refusing to release defendant on personal recognizance bond for all charges that grew out of the same criminal episode, respondent ignored a specific order and mandate of the court The court ordered respondent to release defendant on a personal recognizance bond.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested operating a cash register in a sexually oriented business located within city limits without first having secured a permit required by City of Houston, Tx., Ordinance &sect; 28-122(a). Defendant argued that his motion to dismiss and motion to quash the information were improperly denied because the ordinance, was void for vagueness, due to it being imprecise. The court held that a statute was not to be struck down for vagueness because of imprecision. Furthermore, defendant did not have standing to challenge the ordinance because he did not specifically state how the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague in its application to him. The court found that legislation authorizing the enactment of the ordinance led to the conclusion that the county court at law did have jurisdiction over this matter. The court held that the statute was not void for vagueness and affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, natural mother, voluntarily relinquished her parental rights. Appellant's petition to adopt her minor child was dismissed by the trial cout. The trial court held that appellant lacked standing to adopt her own child because she was a former parent whose parent-child relationship had been terminated by a court decree. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 11.03(g)(1) (1986). On appeal, appellant argued that the amendments to the adoption provisions of the family code did not apply to her. Appellant contended that she had a vested right to adopt her minor child, before the effective date of the amendment. The court held that appellant's petition to adopt was barred by &sect; 11.03(g)(1), because her parental rights were terminated without provision for any right of continuing access or possession, and appellee, children's center, did not consent to the suit. The court held that appellant had no legal rights with respect to her minor child. A decree terminating the parent-child relationship divests the parent of all legal rights, duties, and powers, with respect to the child. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 15.07 (1986).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Criminal Appeals (Texas) vacated the original judgment of the court, which had affirmed appellant's conviction of murder, for consideration as to whether the erroneous jury instruction on the law of parole under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a) (Supp. 1989), constituted harmless error under Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, the jury was given the standard instruction on the law of parole as required by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.03, &sect; 4(a) (1989). Appellant was convicted of murder. Appellant challenged the conviction and asserted that the trial court erred in this instruction because art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a), had been declared unconstitutional. The court held that although art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a), was unconstitutional it was not automatically reversible error to give the instruction. The court held that the trial court's error had to be analyzed under Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2). The court set aside the trial court's judgment for reconsideration of the punishment. The court held that in light of the nature and facts of the crime, appellant's eligibility for probation, the potential range of punishment, and the uncontroverted testimony that appellant was a peaceful and productive citizen, it could not determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury instruction on parole did not contribute to the punishment assessed.</SPAN></P>

Ann. art. 67011-1, &sect; 24(c) (1989), provided that the fact of the lack of a videotape was admissible at trial, but that there was no statutory provision for a dismissal when no videotape was made. The court held that the trial court had no authority to grant a motion to dismiss made by defendant, because state's attorney was the only party authorized to file a motion to dismiss under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32.02 (1966). The court held that defendant's right to counsel did not attach at the time of the arrest or at the time the breathalyzer and videotape were offered.

Appellants argued that the judge's order granting the raise under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 52.051 (1988), did not create a legal duty to perform a nondiscretionary ministerial act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge for whom appellee court reporter worked issued an order under Tex.

Appellee brought a motion for summary judgment seeking a writ of mandamus to compel appellant commissioners court to fund the salary increase. The trial court granted the motion. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision. However, the court's original decision was reversed on appeal. On remand, the court affirmed the summary judgment and held that a district judge's order issued pursuant to &sect; 52.051, to increase his court reporter's pay by 10 percent or less of the court reporter's previous annual salary created &quot;a nondiscretionary ministerial&quot; duty on appellant's part to pay, and the county auditor to approve, the salary increase.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the decision of the 171st District Court of El Paso County, Texas, which convicted and sentenced him to 40 years imprisonment for murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellant's conviction and sentence of 40 years imprisonment for murdering his wife because given appellant's repeated version of his wife's departure and the testimony of his sister, the jury was free to reasonably conclude that appellant was lying about the time of his wife's departure by two hours, and that the vehicle was positioned and the tire punctured for purposes of deception. The court concluded that the jury had sufficient credible evidence to conclude that appellant lied about the time of his wife's departure, that he lied about her having packed her suitcase for a voluntary departure because the suitcase's contents attracted suspicious attention, and that he altered the evidence in his possession prior to police seizure. The court concluded the jury could have reasonably reached its verdict when considering the other evidence such as appellant's inconsistent statements as to the car keys, his fortuitous finding of the victim's missing keys in the woods away from the car, and the restaurant incident where he said he had two boys to &quot;get rid of&quot; depicted by the waitress provided circumstantial support to support the verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction and 40 year imprisonment sentence for murdering his wife because the jury was free to reasonably conclude that appellant fabricated the time of his wife's departure from their house, positioned the vehicle she had been driving to deceive, and lied about her having packed her suitcase because of the unusual contents inside, as well as other circumstantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Criminal Appeals vacated the judgment of the court and remanded the cause for the court to consider whether appellant was harmed by a parole charge that was based on an unconstitutional statute,&nbsp;Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a). The court affirmed its prior judgment after it analyzed the harm under the guidelines of Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2), which provided that the court must reverse a judgment unless it determines, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error did not contribute to the punishment. A jury convicted appellant of aggravated robbery and assessed his punishment at 12 years confinement. During closing arguments at the punishment stage, the prosecutor recommended a punishment of 50 years and did not mention the parole laws. Defense counsel asked the jury to consider probation or the minimum sentence of five years. The statutory instruction telling the jury not to consider the parole laws creates a rebuttable presumption that the jury followed the instruction and there was no evidence to rebut the presumption. The court concluded, beyond a reasonable doubt, the parole instruction did not contribute to the punishment assessed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trial court found appellant guilty of driving while intoxicated. Appellant was fined and sentenced to probation for two years. Appellant sought review and the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in accepting the jury's punishment verdict because the jury did not set a term for probation. The jury's verdict assessed a punishment of 730 days in jail plus a fine. The jury recommended that jail time be probated but did not specify the probationary period. The trial court entered a judgment probating the punishment for two years. Appellant argued that only the jury, and not the court could determine the probationary period pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 3a(b) (1989). The court held that since appellant did not object to his sentencing in the trial court, any error was waived pursuant to Tex. R. App. P. 52(a). The court disagreed with appellant's contention that the driving while intoxicated statute, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 67011-1 (1989), was an unconstitutional extension of the state's police power.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the absence of jury inquiries regarding parole, together with the curative instruction, the heinous facts of the case, the fact that the sentence imposed fell in the mid-range of permissible punishment, and the absence of references to parole during argument, indicated that the jury did not consider the existence of parole for any purpose.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the decision of the County Court at Law No. 1 of Potter County (Texas), which convicted him on a guilty plea for possession of less than two ounces of marijuana and sentenced him to jail, after the trial court refused to suppress marijuana found during an inventory search of his pockets following his arrest under a warrant for violation of parole under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.18, &sect; 14(a) (1989).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Marijuana was found during an inventory of appellant's pockets after his arrest for violation of parole. Appellant challenged the trial court decision which convicted him on a guilty plea for possession of less than two ounces of marijuana and sentenced him to jail. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that because the full panoply of rights due a defendant in an ordinary criminal proceeding did not apply in parole revocations, the warrant for parole revocation, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.18, &sect; 14(a) (1989), was sufficient for arrest without a supporting affidavit, and &sect; 14(a), allowing the parole board to issue arrest warrants on less than probable cause, did not violate U.S. Const. amends. IV, XIV or Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The issue of whether the warrant under &sect; 14(a) should have stated that the parole board had &quot;reason to believe&quot; that appellant violated his parole was not preserved for review. Section 14(a) did not violate the separation of powers doctrine, where the parole board's authority derived from Tex. Const. art. IV, &sect; 11. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.18, &sect; 15(a), provided sufficient due process protection for termination of a parolee's liberty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, holding that under the lesser constitutional protections afforded to parolees, the parole board's arrest warrant for parole violation, which was not supported by an affidavit, issued by a magistrate, or based on probable cause, was sufficient, the parole board's authority properly derived from the Texas Constitution, and parolees received sufficient statutory due process protection for termination of their liberty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant burned a truck and a house, and was convicted by jury of two counts of arson, arising from a single criminal episode. His sentence was enhanced because of prior convictions. Defendant represented himself, but also had appointed counsel. Defendant appealed that his right to self-representation was violated and other errors. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict. It reversed the judgment as to punishment only, and remanded for hearing under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.29(b). The court held that defendant was properly afforded his right to self-representation, that the trial court did not err in permitting defendant's wife to testify against him, and that defendant received effective assistance of counsel. The court held that the trial court erred in submitting a single jury charge on punishment because Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 2(c) (1981) and Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 3.03 (1974) mandated that punishment be assessed on each count arising out of one episode, and that the sentence for each offense be pronounced.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellant, a bank, filed an action against the appellee, a school district, and sought a refund of ad valorem taxes paid by the appellant on its stock. The lower court entered summary judgment in favor of the appellee. On review, the court affirmed the lower court's summary judgment ruling. In so holding, the court held that a decision by the United States Supreme Court, American Bank and Trust Co. v. Dallas County, 463 U.S. 855 (1983), which invalidated the ad valorem tax at issue, did not have retroactive application. Moreover, the court rejected the appellant's contention that the appellee incorrectly assessed the taxes against the appellant, instead of the appellant's shareholders. The court explained that the tax was assessed against the true owners, the shareholders, even though the appellant's name appeared as record owner. The court further explained that nothing restricted the appellant from passing the assessment on to its shareholders. Lastly, the court rejected the appellant's other bases for its entitlement to a refund.</SPAN></P>

The court considered the curative instruction, the nature of the offense, and appellant's prior record. The court affirmed, because the trial court gave a properly curative instruction, because appellant sold the drug to a police officer, who had investigated after neighbors' complaints and watching pedestrian and vehicle traffic to and from the house, and who saw approximately 10 other rocks of cocaine, and becauseappellant had a prior drug conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that the statement in appellant's articles of incorporation that appellant furnished a water supply for general farm use and domestic purposes did not amount to a charitable dedication of appellant's assets as contemplated by Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 11.18(f)(1). Appellant's bylaws did not expressly pledge its assets for use in performing charitable functions, nor did they provide for the exclusive performance of a charitable function, which justified the trial court's conclusion that appellant was not a charitable organization.

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. It found that the trial court properly admitted appellant's confession because appellant was not in custody and nothing in his testimony on his motion to suppress suggested that he thought he was being restrained. The court further found that even if appellant had been in custody his confession was properly admitted because it was freely and properly made following proper warnings given to him. The court concluded that the trial court properly admitted hearsay testimony about the child's allegation of abuse under Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 38.072 (Supp. 1989) because the trier of fact had evidence to conclude that the witness was not fabricating what the child had told her and the judge had evidence to conclude that the child's declaration was sufficiently reliable under art. 38.072.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant of aggravated robbery and assessed punishment at 20 years confinement. In his appeal, appellant asserted that the parole charge given to the jury pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. P.

The court affirmed the conviction and sentence and found that neither appellee nor the defense mentioned the effect of parole law, and appellant was subject to a potential punishment range of 5 to 99 years or life. The court held that while the record did not indicate any prior convictions for appellant, it did amply indicate appellant's participation in the violent crime from its beginning to end. The record showed that appellant initiated the contact, drove the car, and wielded a gun during the actual robbery. Thus, the court held that because the trial court properly included a curative charge, and neither side focused on parole during final arguments, the parole charge did not affect the jury's assessment of punishment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, holding that appellants' claim was barred by the Texas Tort Claims Act, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 101.001 et seq. The court affirmed, holding that appellants had sovereign immunity and appellant did not come within the use of tangible personal property exception to sovereign immunity contained in &sect; 101.021(2). The court determined that appellants had simply routinely used the telephones, the paging system, the medical forms, and the gurney apparatus and that these devices played no substantial role in the death of the family member. In ruling for appellees, the court also decided that no leave to amend would be granted to appellants because the particular acts of appellees which appellants alleged as being negligent plainly failed to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

The court found that a jury instruction given to the jury by the trial court regarding art. 37.07, which dealt with issues of parole, had contributed to the jury's decision on punishment. The court was persuaded by the testimony of jurors from a hearing held after appellant filed a motion for a new trial based on allegations of jury misconduct.

The jury found that defendant used or exhibited a deadly weapon in the commission of the offense. After the court directed the trial court to conduct a hearing to determine whether and how the prosecution notified defendant that it would seek an affirmative jury finding on defendant's use of a deadly weapon, the trial court found that defendant had adequate verbal notice through plea negotiations with the prosecution. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. A witness who was staying at defendant's apartment at the time of the murder testified that when defendant and the codefendants returned, defendant reenacted the crime. He demonstrated how he used a pipe and a knife to strangle and stab the victim. Her testimony satisfied the statutory definition for use of both weapons, and the trial court properly submitted the deadly weapon issue to the jury. The trial court's jury instruction on the law of parole during the punishment phase of the trial was harmless error.

The court held that the outcry statements of other children, implicating appellant in the sexual abuse of children in addition to complainant, evidenced offenses extraneous to the offense for which appellant was on trial. The state did not discharge its burden to show the extraneous offenses with third parties were relevant to any material issue in the prosecution, so as to outweigh their inflammatory or prejudicial potential.

Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07(4)(a). The criminal appeals court held the statute unconstitutional, stating that Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2) was the standard and remanded the cause to determine if reversible error resulted from the charge. The court identified the factors to be used in applying Rule 81(b)(2) which were whether a curative instruction was given, whether the facts of the offense militated in favor of the sentence imposed, whether any reference to the parole law was made in closing argument, and if the defendant had prior felony convictions. The proof showed that appellant had no prior felony convictions. There was no argument by either side on the parole charge and the court submitted a curative instruction charging the jury that it should not consider the application of the parole law to appellant. Additionally, the jury properly assessed punishment. After examining the factors, the court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the unconstitutional parole charge made no contribution to appellant's conviction or punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a hurricane moved the vegetation line to a point landward of appellant land owners' property, appellants built a retaining wall on the beach in front of their home and constructed numerous improvements on the seaward side of the wall. Appellee Attorney General of Texas filed suit pursuant to the Open Beaches Act, alleging that a public easement and right of use existed on the seaward side of the natural vegetation line across appellants' property and that appellants had encroached upon that right of use by placing structures and objects on the easement. The trial court granted appellee's summary judgment motion, ordered the removal of the obstructions on the easement, and enjoined appellants from further activity which restrained or interfered with the public's right of access to the beach. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, holding that there was no unconstitutional taking of appellants' land because the Open Beaches Act did not empower appellee to take rights from a land owner, but furnished a means to enforce the public's existing rights of acquiring its easements through prescription, dedication, and custom.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the error in the trial court's instruction to the jury on the parole law did not contribute to the punishment in this case. Because the trial court gave cautionary instructions which the jury was presumed to have followed; defense counsel admonished the jury to consider only the facts of the case and not be misled by the parole laws and both the defense and the state made further cautionary remarks regarding the parole laws; proof of defendant's guilt was overwhelming; and the jury assessed fewer years of imprisonment than were asked for by the prosecution, the court concluded that the statutory parole law instruction did not affect defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's conviction was reversed and the case remanded for a new trial. Subsequently, a criminal appeals court ruled that a harmless error analysis should be applied to the review of cases decided prior to the voiding of art. 38.071. Defendant's case was again reviewed on appeal, and the court affirmed his conviction, holding that the trial court's error in admitting the videotaped interview made no contribution to the conviction because defendant's attorney was given the opportunity to cross-examine the child, who testified in the state's case-in-chief immediately after the videotape was shown.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment by the 174th District Court, Harris County, Texas, which convicted defendant of aggravated sexual assault and assessed punishment at 60 years confinement. Defendant claimed that the charge given the jury pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 3707(4)(a) violated the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his companion pulled over the victim by using a red light on the dashboard of their pick-up, making the victim think she was being pulled over by police. Defendant struck the victim on the head, hand-cuffed her, and then defendant and his companion had sexual intercourse with her. Afterwards, they forced the victim to withdraw money with her automatic teller card. Defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault and assessed punishment at 60 years confinement. Defendant appealed, contending that the trial court violated the separation of powers doctrine by giving the parole charge to the jury pursuant to Tex. Code. Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 3707(4)(a). The court overruled the error and affirmed the judgment. After giving the statutory parole charge, the trial court gave a curative charge that the jurors were not to discuss the effect of parole on the sentence, and that the issue of parole was one for the executive branch. The state reiterated the curative charge during the punishment phase. The court applied Tex. R. App. Proc. 81(b)(2) to determine that it found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant suffered no harm as a result of the parole charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled defendant's point of error and affirmed the judgment entered upon the jury's determination that defendant was guilty of aggravated sexual assault, and assessed a punishment of 60 years confinement, because the trial court's parole charge in violation of the separation of powers doctrine was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who sold and delivered a small amount of cocaine to an undercover police officer, was ultimately convicted after a jury found him guilty of actual delivery of cocaine weighing less than 28 grams, found one enhancement paragraph true, and assessed punishment at 40 years confinement. Defendant appealed, and the court reversed and remanded to the trial court for a new trial on the issue of punishment only, and affirmed the remainder of the judgment. The court held that the trial court erred in giving the unconstitutional parole instruction, and that, after applying the harm analysis set forth in Tex. R. App. Proc. 81(b)(2), the court could not find beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the punishment assessed. The trial court did not give the curative instruction that parole matters came within the exclusive jurisdiction of the executive branch and, thus, were no concern of the jury. Additionally, the state argued in closing that defendant could earn time off the sentence through an award of good conduct time and that the sentence could be reduced by the award of parole. Thus, the court could not say that the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating of the Bingo Enabling Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 179d, &sect; 11(q) (1989), which prohibited the award of any prizes to persons present at a bingo occasion, other than prizes for the games themselves. The appellate court reversed and reformed the conviction to reflect an acquittal, holding that defendant did not violate the statute by awarding a door prize during the intermission between two bingo sessions. Because the statute did not define &quot;bingo occasion&quot;, the court looked first at the plain meaning of the word &quot;occasion&quot; and the legislative history of the Act and held that the statute did not apply to the intermission. The court noted that the Act required the issuance of a license, and that there were specified time limits on the series of games an organization could operate. Viewing the statute as a whole and under the rule of strict construction, the court held that &quot;bingo occasion&quot; referred to the time during which a series of successive bingo games were conducted by a licensed organization, and time outside of an organization's licensed hours could not be considered part of the &quot;bingo occasion&quot;.</SPAN></P>

After defendant's motion to quash the complaint was denied, he entered his non-negotiated plea of nolo contendere which was accepted by the lower court. Defendant appealed and contended there were two points of error committed by the lower court in its denial of his motion to quash. As to defendant's first point, the court held that the statute prohibiting the sale of obscene material was not unconstitutionally vague. Not only did defendant not request a prior determination of obscenity, but the material purchased did not constitute an unconstitutional &quot;seizure&quot; that would require a pre-seizure hearing to determine whether the material was obscene. As to defendants' second point, the court held that defendant could not argue on appeal that his conviction was invalid because no timely and proper determination of obscenity was raised. Even if defendant's second contention had once been correctly predicated by defendant's later plea of nolo contendere, he admitted every element of the offense including the element that the material was obscene when he sold it.</SPAN></P>

Defendant petitioned for discretionary review contending that the trial court erred in submitting good time and parole instructions to the jury on the grounds that the charge was predicated on an unconstitutional statute,&nbsp;Tex.

Defendant's petition on the constitutional issue was granted and remanded for the court to conduct a harmless error analysis under Tex. R.

The court found that state made an erroneous summary of the parole law to the jury in its opening argument, providing the jury a reason to give the defendant maximum sentence, and attributed it to the trial court's charge. The state concentrated on the facts and the severity of defendant's offense and offered no evidence during the punishment phase of the trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant retailer operated a mail order catalog. Sales invoices assessed charges for &quot;postage and handling&quot; and appellant excluded that total charge from its taxable receipts. A sales tax deficiency notice was issued to appellant after an audit by appellee Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas. Appellant paid under protest and sought a refund in the district court. The court affirmed the district court's take-nothing judgment, holding that appellant had improperly commingled taxable and non-taxable charges. The court found that handling charges did not fall within the definition of &quot;transportation&quot; which excluded activities at the retailer's premises prior to loading goods on trucks for shipment. Charges for handling, the court held, could not be excluded from taxable receipts, although charges for postage could be excluded. The court went on to hold that appellant had not complied with the requirements of Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 151.007 which required that transportation charges be separately stated to customers because appellants' charges were commingled with handling charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the take-nothing judgment denying a sales tax refund to appellant retailer because the notice of tax deficiency issued to appellant by appellee Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas was proper, as appellant had commingled charges that were taxable with charges that were non-taxable and had excluded the total charge from its taxable receipts.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled that the act was not applicable to appellee, but refused to allow appellee's land to be taxed at full fair market value, and based the value on a self-imposed restriction filed by appellee in the county deed records. Both parties appealed, and the court reformed and affirmed the judgment, holding that the act provided a method of assessing value based on the reasonable classification of property and was therefore constitutional, and that appellee was entitled to appraisal under the act. The court found that deed restrictions limiting land use to recreational filed by appellee in accord with the act were binding on buyers and enforceable by the state, that use of the property for restaurants and a barbershop did not violate the mandate of Tex.

The court held that although the trial court improperly allowed prosecution to bolster the testimony of the complaining witness, the error was harmless. The court also found that testimony about information obtained from a computer search was not hearsay and was properly admitted. Prosecution's reference to defendant, during argument, a &quot;stone pathological liar&quot; was not manifestly improper and not reversible error. While the trial court committed error in giving an instruction on statutory parole pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art 37.07 &sect; 4, the court held that the error was also harmless based on a curative instruction that was given and the fact that the jury recommended a sentence at the low end of the punishment range. The court further found that there was no showing that any information that was material or that was in prosecutor's possession had been denied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of delivering over 400 grams of cocaine an sentenced to 15 years' confinement and a $ 250 fine, the minimum sentence under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art 4476-15 &sect;&sect; 4.02(b)(3)(D) and 4.03(d) (1989). Appellant alleged entrapment, and the court disagreed, noting that appellant failed both to meet his initial burden of showing that an inducement to sell cocaine occurred and to show that a party to the sale was a law enforcement agent or under the control of one. The court also rejected appellant's contention that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15 &sect; 4.03 (d)(3) (198) violated due process and equal protection because the mandatory sentence precluded the possibility of probation. The court held that constitutional due process and equal protection generally demanded only a rational basis for legislatively created classifications, and that the state's legitimate interest in deterring unlawful deliveries provided sufficient rational basis for proscribing probation. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, overruling both of appellant's points of error.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in submitting good time and parole instructions to the jury. The court affirmed defendant's conviction on remand and found that the submission of the unconstitutional instructions was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2). The court found that during jury argument at the close of the punishment phase, neither the state nor defense counsel mentioned the parole instructions. Although a note from the jury showed that they were considering the parole instructions included in the charge, the court found that it did not necessarily follow that such consideration contributed to defendant's punishment. Based upon the calculated, cold-blooded execution of a crippled, intoxicated, and sleeping man, together with the deadly weapon finding, and defendant's prior convictions which revealed a propensity for violence, the court held that beyond a reasonable doubt the error made no contribution to defendant's punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, bail bond principal and sureties, executed a bail bond in favor of appellee State of Texas. The bond was then forfeited, and appellee was awarded the amount of the bond after a trial. Appellants challenged the judgment, arguing that the recently amended version of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 22.16 (1987), which provided that a final judgment could not be entered against a bond earlier than 18 months after the date the forfeiture was entered, should have been applied retroactively to their case. The court affirmed the judgment. The court found that Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 stated that the legislature could not make a retroactive law or a law impairing the obligation of contracts. The court then found that the bail bond was a contract between appellants and appellee. The court concluded that retroactive application of art. 22.16 would have impaired appellee's vested rights under the bond agreement. The court also held that art. 22.16 was a substantive change in the law and should not have been applied retroactively. As the case was determinable on other grounds, the court did not consider appellee's argument that amended art. 22.16 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the 179th District Court, Harris County, Texas, which convicted defendant of the felony offense of driving while intoxicated. Defendant alleged that the trial court erred by denying his requested jury instruction, that he was denied effective assistance of counsel, and that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art 6701L-1, under which he was convicted, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for driving while intoxicated and asserted that because his testimony was in direct conflict with the testimony presented by the officers, a factual dispute was raised over the legality of the initial stop, and as a result of this dispute, he was entitled to a jury instruction pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.23 (1959). On appeal, the court held that in any case where the legal evidence raises an issue, the jury shall be instructed that if it believes, or has a reasonable doubt, that the evidence was obtained in violation of the provisions of article 35.23, the jury shall disregard any such evidence so obtained. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and concluded that defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction regarding the admissibility of the officer's testimony. The court also held that in light of the above decision it was unnecessary to address the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel. In addition, the court noted that the issue of the constitutionality of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art 6701L-1 had previously been decided.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court convicting defendant of driving while intoxicated. The court held that the officers were justified in stopping defendant for the traffic violation of following too closely and thus he was not entitled to a jury instruction regarding the admissibility of the officer's testimony. Based upon the above holding, the court did not address the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of burglary of a building with intent to commit theft after he was identified by a county sheriff deputy as being seen leaving the building where a burglar alarm was triggered. At trial, defendant objected to the inclusion of the parole charge. At the end of the statutory parole instruction, the trial court gave an instruction telling the jury that they could not consider the manner which the parole law may be applied to defendant. The court found that the presumption that the jury followed was to totally disregard parole, coupled with defendant's prior extensive criminal record, lead to the conclusion that the statutory parole instruction did not affect defendant's sentence. The court applied the harm analysis required under Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2), and held that defendant was convicted of a non-heinous crime, the enhancement paragraphs found true were for two non-violent crimes, burglary of a building with intent to commit theft and felony theft, and his punishment fell within the range of the allowed by statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal defendant challenged a judgment of the 228th District Court, Harris County, Texas, which convicted him of aggravated sexual assault following the submission of parole law instructions to the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault after the trial court submitted an instruction to the jury on the existence of the parole law pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07 (1989). On appeal, the court found that art. 37.07 had been deemed unconstitutional, and it then stated that reversal was required under Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2) unless it determined, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error made no contribution to the punishment assessed. The court concluded that the error was harmless and affirmed appellant's conviction. The court found that appellant not only did not object to the parole charge, he argued it as a fact in his favor. Moreover, he made his argument over the state's objection. Thus, the court held that the record reflected that inclusion of the unconstitutional parole charge was viewed at trial by both sides as favorable to appellant and harmful to the state. Under the facts of the case, the court found that it was apparently part of appellant's trial strategy to have the jury receive this charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate challenged the order of the 349th Judicial District Court of Anderson County, Texas, dismissing his suit upon the trial court's determination that it was frivolous. Appellant alleged that appellee, Director of the Texas Department of Corrections (TDC), violated his rights guaranteed by the Texas Constitution. Appellant also contended that three TDC disciplinary rules were unconstitutionally void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate complained of a policy denying him a cassette player in his cell. He asserted that a tape player was necessary in order for him to meditate three times daily, a practice of his religion. Appellant claimed denial of a tape player violated Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, as well as &sect; 19 (due process), &sect; 13 (cruel or unusual punishment), and &sect;&sect; 3 and 3a (equality under the law). He also contended that three disciplinary rules were unconstitutionally void for vagueness. The court, in affirming the dismissal of appellant's suit as frivolous, held that realistic chances of ultimate success for the claim were slight. Appellee Director of the Texas Department of Corrections (TDC) had the power to promulgate reasonable rules governing the treatment and discipline of prisoners with the consent of the TDC. The court held that a rule denying inmate's unfettered possession of objects, which could be used for weapons, was reasonable. The court held that appellant's complaint regarding the disciplinary rules was equally frivolous. Although he asserted that the rules were void for vagueness, appellant failed to allege or show how he was harmed by any of the rules.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In affirming the order of the trial court, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the cause as frivolous. The court further concluded that appellant, inmate's chance of succeeding on any of his allegations were slight, and that he did not have standing to litigate any matter regarding the rules.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was indicted for the offense of delivery of a controlled substance. He pled guilty and was given a probated sentence of five years' confinement and a $ 750 fine. Later, appellee state brought a motion to revoke probation, which the trial court granted. On appeal the court affirmed the trial court, holding that the trial judge was within her discretion to find that appellant had failed to report to his probation officer as ordered during three months, or to the required Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, given appellant's admission that he falsified the forms that would prove he attended. The court also held that the cover sheet, a copy of the indictment, and a specific recess taken by the trial court indicated that the trial court was laboring under the constitutionally correct range of punishment when she sentenced appellant. Finally the court held that substances containing quantities of barbituric acid were designated by name in the controlled substances act as a penalty group three drug, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.02(d)(2) (1988), so that it was not necessary for appellee to allege and prove that the drug was a controlled substance.</SPAN></P>

The lower court found in favor of appellee and awarded damages and attorney fees to appellee. Appellant challenged the ruling, contending that the evidence did not support the submission of special issues to the jury or the verdict and that the trial should have been severed. The court reformed the lower court's judgment by awarding attorney fees to appellee instead of his lawyer. The court affirmed the rest of the judgment, concluding that appellant waived some objections by failing to preserve them in the record, that the lower court had discretion to deny severance of issues at trial, and that interest of 10 percent was proper.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the solicitation of another to commit capital murder and the trial court assessed punishment at 38 years confinement in the Texas Department of Corrections. On appeal, the court affirmed. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, the court found that the witness testimony, even disregarding the testimony of the alleged person who was solicited, sufficiently corroborated both the solicitation and defendant's intent that the murder be carried out. The trial court had not erred in not excluding evidence of several extraneous offenses because the evidence was admissible to show the context and circumstances surrounding the crime charged. The trial court's charge properly informed the jury under what circumstances they could have considered defendant's extraneous offenses. The trial court's charge properly informed the jury to consider the testimony of the solicited person only if they determined that his testimony was corroborated by evidence showing the solicitation itself and defendant's intent that he act on the solicitation. Any delays in bringing defendant to trial were caused by defendant and therefore he waived his right to speedy trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a church where he shot and killed a pastor. Defendant subsequently surrendered to authorities and was arrested. At trial, defendant pled not guilty and raised the affirmative defense of insanity. After rejection of defendant's not guilty plea, defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to 50 years imprisonment. Defendant sought review of the decision alleging that the lower court erred in allowing his recorded confession into evidence because it was taken in violation of his right to counsel. The court affirmed and reformed the judgment holding that the totality of the circumstances did not show any waiver of defendant's request for counsel. The court held that the lower court did not commit reversible error by allowing in defendant's confession because there was an abundance of evidence demonstrating defendant's guilt and the state did not need the statement to establish that guilt. The court held that defendant did not receive notice of the state's intent to pursue a deadly weapon finding and therefore the affirmative deadly weapon finding could not be employed against defendant and was stricken from the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of injury to a child and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 65 years. Defendant was alleged to have beaten a 21-month old child for a period of a week, eventually resulting in the child's death. Defendant's conviction was affirmed on appeal, but vacated by the Court of Criminal Appeals after discretionary review of defendant's petition. The prosecution mentioned during the punishment stage of the trial of defendant's eligibility for parole which resulted in a motion for rehearing. On review, the court overruled the motion for rehearing and affirmed defendant's judgment of conviction. The court reasoned that the repeated brutality alleged to have been committed in this case by the defendant was the cause of defendant's lengthy sentence. The court found nothing to suggest that the jury ignored a trial court instruction to not consider how parole or good behavior would affect their sentence. Thus, the court found the prosecution's erroneous statement harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction and overruled the motion for rehearing because the erroneous parole instruction was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt and did not compel reversal of defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in a jury trial for the offense of burglary of a habitation and the jury assessed punishment at 99 years confinement. Defendant appealed and argued that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the law concerning good time and parole as the charge was based on an unconstitutional statute,&nbsp;Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4. The trial court rejected defendant's constitutional challenge. The court of criminal appeals subsequently held the statute unconstitutional and upon defendant's petition for discretionary review, reversed and remanded the trial court's decision for a determination of whether the error was harmless. The court held that without a curative instruction, the court could not find beyond a reasonable doubt that submission of the unconstitutional parole law instruction did not contribute to the verdict of 99 years when the minimum punishment was 25 years confinement. Thus, reversal was necessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder for intentionally and knowingly causing the death of two persons during the same criminal transaction by shooting them with a firearm. The trial court assessed punishment at life imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The indictment was not unconstitutionally void for vagueness because the indictment properly alleged an act prohibited by statute and defendant failed to show that it was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him. In reviewing the sufficiency of evidence, the court found that the evidence supported a finding that a pistol, admittedly fire by defendant, was used in a deadly manner, and that defendant intentionally and knowingly caused the two victims to be shot in the head, resulting in their deaths. The trial court had not erred in refusing defendant's requested instruction on the lesser-included offenses because there was no evidence that defendant was guilty of only the lesser-included offenses. The trial court had not erred in dismissing a prospective juror for cause because he failed to meet the requirement of the ability to write and express his ideas in writing where he was unable to fill out juror questionnaire.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.021 (1989). He challenged his conviction, alleging that the trial court's parole instruction under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 constituted reversible error. The court disagreed, and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that the parole instruction was unconstitutional but that the error was harmless. The court applied the following factors for determining whether the error was harmless under Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2) : (1) whether a curative instruction was given; (2) whether the prosecution invited consideration of the instruction; (3) whether the facts of the offense militated in favor of the sentence imposed; and (4) whether the defendant had a history of prior felony convictions. Finding that the unconstitutional instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and made no contribution to the punishment assessed, the court held that there was no reversible error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the County Criminal Court at Law No. 8 of Harris County, Texas, which entered a judgment of conviction for a misdemeanor offense of resisting arrest, Tex. Penal Code &sect; 38.03, after defendant allegedly attempted to grab a uniformed officer's gun while the officer was attempting to restrain defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for resisting arrest, a misdemeanor offense under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 38.03, after he allegedly attempted to take a uniformed officer's gun while the officer attempted to restrain defendant to investigate a possible auto theft. The court affirmed the conviction because there was sufficient evidence to prove the offense, and the jury was not bound to accept defendant's testimony that he was unaware that he was being apprehended by a police officer. The court found that a failure to define terms in &sect; 38.03 such as &quot;arrest&quot; was at most harmless error and the admission of evidence of the extraneous offense of auto theft was proper to show the context in which the resisting arrest offense occurred. The court further found that defendant's own testimony as to whether he knew of the police officer's status abrogated the necessity of a defensive instruction of mistake of fact or other defenses. The court held that a motion to suppress filed on the day of trial was untimely and properly denied, and any error in the examination of witnesses was not preserved. The court found that &sect; 38.03 was not unconstitutionally vague and gave fair notice of prohibited acts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for resisting arrest because the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of guilt where defendant attempted to grab an officer's gun while being restrained.

The court also held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider defendant's argument that an independent, pre-arrest, judicial determination of obscenity was a prerequisite of a constitutional prosecution for the sale of obscene material. The court found that because &sect; 43.21 tracked the Miller test for obscenity and did not inject considerations of community standards into the separate determination of the work's value, it passed constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried and convicted for delivery of cocaine.

The court held that based on the applicable standards and evidence presented, defendant received reasonably effective assistance of counsel during the guilt-innocence stage and punishment stage of trial under the U.S. Const. amend. VI. The court determined that the trial court's instruction to the jury was based on an unconstitutional parole charge, but the instruction did not constitute reversible error because it made no contribution to defendant's conviction or punishment.

At trial, the trial court gave an instruction to the jury which allowed them to speculate with regard to the amount of time that would be served. The appellate criminal court remanded the matter to the court to determine whether defendant's conviction should be affirmed or reversed in light of a recent decision by the appellate criminal court regarding the fact that this type of instruction was based on an unconstitutional statute. On appeal, the court held that the situation and facts in the present case were entirely different from that in the recent appellate criminal court opinion. The court also held that the jury reached the correct verdict. However, the court held that its hands were tied by the recent appellate criminal court opinion which simply forbade the verdict to stand. Therefore, the court reversed and remanded as to the punishment phase of the proceeding only, because the court held that it could not be said that the charge had no effect whatsoever on the punishment assessed.</SPAN></P>

The criminal appeals court vacated and remanded the case back to the court for a harmless error analysis under the guidelines of Tex. R.

The court considered the fact that a curative admonishment instructing the jury not to consider the effect of parole on any sentence had been read, and that the record had not reflected or even suggested that any juror did otherwise, defendant's determined attempt to break into the complainant's home militated in favor of the sentence imposed, and the fact that defendant had five prior felony convictions.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that 31 Tex. Admin. Code &sect; 57.376 (1988), as adopted by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission and as applied, was inconsistent with Tex. Parks &amp; Wild. Code Ann. &sect; 66.201(f) (1989) as adopted by the legislature. Under 31 Tex. Admin. Code &sect; 57.372(e)(1) (1988) an invoice was required to accompany all intrastate shipments of redfish and &sect; 57.372(f) provided that failure to comply would be a Class A misdemeanor.

Parks &amp; Wild. Code Ann. &sect; 66.201(f). The court found defendant's contention that Tex. Parks &amp; Wild. Code Ann. &sect; 66.201 (1989) was unconstitutional because it delegated to an administrative agency the power to make a law prescribing a penalty to be without merit because the legislature itself mandated the failure to account for an invoice was unlawful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, wife and child of man who committed suicide with a handgun, appealed from order of 172nd District Court of Jefferson County, Texas, which granted summary judgment to appellees, owner of store that sold the handgun to the man and the gun's manufacturer, in appellants' personal injury suit against appellees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife's husband committed suicide after purchasing a gun from appellee storeowner that was manufactured by appellee manufacturer. Appellant wife, individually and on behalf of her minor child, filed a personal injury suit against appellees. The trial court granted appellees' summary judgment motions. The court reversed the summary judgment for the storeowner. While suicide generally constituted an intervening force that broke the line of causation from the wrongful act to the death, it was not an absolute bar. Although the storeowner alleged suicide as the sole cause of death in his summary judgment motion, he gave no proof in his brief in support of the motion. Thus, summary judgment could not be sustained on this ground. There were fact issues relating to another ground for summary judgment raised by the storeowner. The court affirmed the summary judgment for the manufacturer. There was evidence that all it did was manufacture the gun. The sale of handguns was not an ultrahazardous activity for purposes of strict liability in tort. There was no duty to warn the storeowner of the dangers of handguns because the manufacturer submitted proof that he knew of such dangers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed summary judgment for storeowner because there was no evidence to support his affirmative defense of suicide and because there were fact issues relating to his other ground for summary judgment. It affirmed summary judgment for manufacturer because it had no duty to control improper use of firearms.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee landowners sold a motel in 1977, but retained a deed of trust lien on the property. In 1981, appellant city enacted a hotel occupancy tax, which the motel did not pay for the year 1983. In 1984, appellant was preparing to file a tax lien on the motel's property when appellees foreclosed on their deed of trust. Appellees then filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment that the deed of trust lien was prior to appellant's tax lien, and that appellees' foreclosure extinguished the tax lien. The trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment and extinguished the tax lien and removed the cloud on the title. Appellant sought review, and the court reversed, holding that appellees were not entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law because appellees did not meet their burden of proof by establishing appellant's tax ordinance was a retroactive law that impaired the obligation of appellees' contractual rights under their deed of trust.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon a jury verdict, the trial court convicted appellant of murder. Appellant claimed on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to prove his intent beyond a reasonable doubt, basing his claim upon a statement of facts in which he indicated to police that he accidentally shot the deceased. Also, appellant contended that the trial court committed reversible error because the jury charge contained both counts of the indictment in one paragraph. The court rejected appellant's arguments and affirmed the conviction. In examining the sufficiency of the evidence, the court concluded that there was enough evidence for the jury to have found intent on the part of appellant based on appellant's statements to a police officer on the scene, his statements to the deceased's wife, appellant's written statement, and the fact that appellant and the deceased were gambling and intoxicated. Further, the verdict was upheld because there was sufficient evidence to support a finding under the charge, which alleged different ways of committing the same offense of murder rather than different offenses.</SPAN></P>

Appellant claimed lack of jurisdiction, statute of limitations, lack of evidence showing appellee's jurisdiction over the automobile and of authority, and other procedural errors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer disputed the six years delinquent ad valorem taxes assessed by appellee Lavaca County Appraisal District, and appealed the trial court decision awarding appellee $ 364.75. Rejecting appellant's argument that the amount involved did not meet the minimum under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 33.41 (1982), the court ruled that the trial court retained jurisdiction because appellant never alleged the valuation was made in bad faith or fraudulently. However, the court rejected appellee's argument that Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 55 permitted its suit for all six years, saying that Tex. Prop. Tax Code &sect; 33.05 (Supp. 1989) set the limit at four years. Therefore, the court reversed the decision for two of the years, and affirmed liability for the other years. The court added that appellant waived wrongful inclusion of his property by failing to exhaust his administrative remedies and waived any complaint under Tex. R. Civ. P. 296. The court also held that a compilation of delinquent taxes was admissible under Tex. Prop. Tax Code &sect; 33.47(a) (Supp. 1989).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, state medical college and its officials, challenged the order of the 212th District Court of Galveston County (Texas), directing appellants to award appellee student his medical degree and declaring invalid appellant college's determination to dismiss student for poor academic performance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court held that academic dismissal of appellee student by appellants, state medical college and its officials, violated the student's constitutional rights of procedural and substantive due process and equal protection, as well as a contract between the student and appellant college created by the college catalog. On appeal, the court reversed and held that, in light of the limited role allowed to the trial court in reviewing academic decisions of educational institutions, as well as a de novo review of trial record, appellant college and its officials did not exceed their authority in dismissing the student for academic reasons. The court also held that, regarding the student's contract claim, appellants' defense of sovereign immunity had been waived by appellants' failure to plead it as an affirmative defense; however, the court held that no contract arose out of appellant college's catalogue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dissolved the injunction against appellants, state medical college and its officials, reversed the trial court's judgment, and rendered judgment against appellee student in his action to compel appellants to award him a medical degree. Appellants' academic dismissal of student did not violate due process or equal protection, and no contract existed between the parties preventing academic dismissal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of two offenses of obscenity under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23(c)(1). Appellant raised two points of error, asserting that the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motion to quash the informations. In his first point of error appellant attacked the constitutionality of the state's obscenity statute maintaining that the statute made the basis of his prosecution indefinite, uncertain, and vague. In his second point of error, appellant contended that the statute was violative of U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV. The court affirmed, finding that appellant failed to preserve error. The court held that a point of error, which did not comport with the objection made at trial, failed to preserve anything for review. Here, appellant's motions to quash complaint did not mention the state's obscenity statute at all, instead mounting an attack upon a city adult arcade ordinance. The trial court was never confronted with the questions of whether the state's obscenity statute, which served as the basis of these prosecutions, was void for vagueness or whether that statute was constitutionally infirm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted appellant convict on one charge of obscenity in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23(c)(1). Appellant challenged the conviction and his sentence of four days confinement and a fine of $ 650. Appellant asserted that the obscenity law was void for vagueness and that the trial court erred in its denial of his pre-trial motions to quash the information because there was not a timely and proper determination of obscenity. The court affirmed and found that appellant failed to specify which part of the statute was vague. The court also noted that appellant failed to direct attention to any statutory language that he alleged to be indefinite, vague or uncertain. There was nothing in the record that supported appellant's contention that there was no prior judicial determination of probable cause with respect the whether the allegedly obscene material sold by appellant was in fact obscene. The court held that the statutory standard of obscenity mirrored the federal standard in that it regulated works taken as a whole and determined by the average person who applied contemporary community standards to have appealed to a prurient interest in sex.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, school district, association, and agency, declared appellee student ineligible for extracurricular activities under Tex. Educ. Code &sect; 21.920 (1987) when appellee failed a course. The lower court enjoined appellants from preventing appellee's participation in a track competition because appellee did not receive statutory notice of his failing grade, and track was not an extracurricular activity under 19 Tex. Admin. Code &sect; 97.113(m). On review, appellee moved to dismiss on mootness grounds. The court found that appellee's graduation extinguished actual controversy. The &quot;capable of repetition, yet evading review&quot; exception to the mootness doctrine did not apply because appellee challenged section 97.113(m). Appellee agency could avoid repetition and review by changing its rules. The court rejected appellants' claim of collateral consequences to persons who would have received a medal but for appellee's competition participation. Appellants would not suffer collateral consequences, and the potentially aggrieved persons had not joined suit. Further, collateral consequences contemplated serious prejudice.

The court affirmed appellants' convictions.

The court held that the fact that the statute could be unconstitutional as applied to others was not sufficient. The court stated that appellants did not have standing to challenge the statute because appellants did not demonstrate or even allege that the ordinance was unconstitutional as it was applied to them. Next, the court held that the county court had jurisdiction over the case because a violation of section 28-122(a) was a class B misdemeanor and jurisdiction over class B misdemeanors lied with the county court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted appellee relief and an appeal ensued. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and dissolved the injunction. According to the court, it was well settled that a court of equity could not enjoin the enforcement of a penal ordinance unless the ordinance was unconstitutional or otherwise void and the enforcement of the ordinance caused irreparable injury to vested property rights. The court held that because the ordinance was a penal statute, the court lacked jurisdiction to issue the injunction because appellee expressly stated that it was not contending that the ordinance was unconstitutional or otherwise void. The court continued and held that the rule denying injunctive relief against enforcement of the criminal laws applies with equal force to a declaratory action construing a penal ordinance. The court stated that a mere allegation that a penal ordinance was misapplied did not confer jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Voters adopted the Fire and Police Employee Relations Act (FPERA), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5154c-1 (1987), which gave firefighters and policemen the right to organize for purposes of collective bargaining. Furthermore, FPERA prohibited strikes and provided &quot;reasonable alternatives&quot; to the right to strike. Subsequently, the lower court authorized an ordinance that repealed an earlier ordinance of appellee city that required binding arbitration in collective bargaining impasses between appellant union and appellee. Appellant argued that the repealing ordinance conflicted with FPERA, which was state law. The court held that an ordinance could not be legally enacted by the governing body of a city which conflicted or was inconsistent with a state statute; however, the court found that, because nothing in FPERA required binding arbitration, the ordinance which repealed the ordinance requiring binding arbitration was not inconsistent with FPERA. As such, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that defendant failed to prove purposeful discrimination by the prosecution in its use of peremptory challenges.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction in the trial court of five counts of selling obscene videotapes to police officers in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23(c)(1) and his sentence of six days in jail and $ 150 fine on each count, and asserted that the trial court erred when it refused to quash on the basis that the statute was vague, indefinite, and uncertain, and because there was not a timely determination of obscenity. The court affirmed and found that appellant's general attack on the statute was unsupported by prior decisions of the federal appellate court. The statute was not void for vagueness. The court found that the definition of obscenity that was originally crafted by the United States Supreme Court was only later enhanced and not reversed by subsequent decisions. The court found that the test was not whether an ordinary person who applied community standards would have found an allegedly obscene work to have had serious value, but whether a reasonable person would have found such value. The court held that the Texas statute was not offended by the subsequent federal decisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A conviction of the sale obscene videotapes was affirmed because the statute was held by both federal and state courts to have not been void for vagueness, because the standard for the determination of obscene material was whether a reasonable person who applied community value found serious value in the work, and because the federal definition did not counter the statutory state definition.</SPAN></P>

Responding to appellant's eight points of error, the court reversed and rendered, remanded in part, and affirmed in part. The court affirmed that the finding that appellees had standing to bring the suit, but reversed and rendered judgment because suit was not filed until after four years from enactment of ordinances; thus, the statute of limitations barred appellees' claims. Also, there was no evidence to support the trial court's findings and conclusions. The court further held that the trial court had no power to redraft the ordinance to remove annexation the floating islands; thus the ordinances were valid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction by a jury of the offense of murder. Appellant argued that the court erred in failing to submit to the jury the lesser included offenses of negligent homicide and involuntary manslaughter. The judgment was affirmed because the evidence did not establish that if appellant were guilty at all, he was guilty only of the offense of negligent homicide or of involuntary manslaughter. There were only two theories presented by the evidence as to how appellant's child suffered the injuries that caused her death. One theory was that appellant caused it by grabbing the victim's hair and slamming her head against the floor. The other theory was that the injury might have been caused when the child fell over the coffee table and hit her head on the couch. The jury found that appellant intentionally, with intent to cause serious bodily injury, committed an act clearly dangerous to human life, which caused the child's death. The judgment was affirmed because the evidence was consistent with the offense of murder as found by the jury, and there was no evidence reflecting a lack of intent to cause serious bodily injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for murder was affirmed because appellant was not entitled to an instruction on any lesser included offenses because appellant intentionally caused the death of his daughter by beating her without mercy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction in the trial court wherein he had entered a plea of nolo contendere to the offense of obscenity under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23(c)(1). Defendant claimed that the trial court erred by denying his pretrial motion to quash the information and raised two points of error on appeal. He asserted that &sect; 43.23(c)(1), which was the basis of his prosecution, was unconstitutionally indefinite, uncertain and vague and that his pretrial motion to quash should have been granted because there was not a timely and proper determination of obscenity. In affirming his conviction, the court did not reach the merits of defendant's points of error, finding that he failed to preserve error for review. The court observed that his motion to quash the complaint had not mentioned &sect; 43.23(c)(1) but instead had mounted an attack upon City of Houston, Tex., Adult Arcade Ordinance &sect;&sect; 28-91(a), 28-84 and thus the trial court was never confronted with the points of error raised on appeal regarding &sect; 43.23(c)(1).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was caught exiting a closed restaurant's window. When the restaurant manager was called to the scene, he determined that the window had been damaged and that a cigarette machine had been tampered with. Officers searched defendant, finding $ 95 in quarters and a screwdriver. Defendant waived a jury trial and was convicted and sentenced for burglary of a building. On appeal, defendant claimed the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because the manager was not the owner of the building. The court noted that the manager was a statutory owner because he was an employee who exercised control or management of the property and had a greater right to possession of the property than defendant. Under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 42.03(2)(a), the defendant was entitled to credit for all time spent in jail from the day of his arrest until his sentence. Because defendant was not given the proper credit, the sentence was modified to reflect credit for time served. Defendant's constitutional challenge to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. 1.15 was rejected because he waived his right to a jury trial and did not offer evidence at trial. The judgment, as modified, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his obscenity conviction under Tex. Penal Code &sect; 43.23(c)(1) on grounds that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and that there was not a timely and proper determination of obscenity. The court found that defendant failed to specify what part of &sect; 43.23(c)(1) was vague or how it reached constitutionally protected conduct. There was nothing in the record to support defendant's contention that there was no judicial determination of probable cause as to whether the materials he sold were obscene. The court noted that defendant did not properly preserve the issue for review. Defendant also claimed that the obscenity definition of &sect; 43.23(c)(1) applied an inappropriate standard to determine a work's value. The court rejected that argument, noting that &sect; 43.23(c)(1) properly applied an average person standard to determine if a material or performance taken as a whole appealed to the prurient interest in sex. This average person standard was not linked to the statute's second inquiry, which required a determination of whether the material or performance as a whole lacked serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific value.

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23(c)(1). Appellant challenged the conviction and sentence to three days confinement and fine of $ 300 on each offense, and asserted that the obscenity statute was vague, indefinite, and uncertain, and because the trial court erred when it failed to quash because there was no timely determination of obscenity.

The court affirmed the conviction without reaching the merits of defendant's points of error. Assertions in defendant's brief that his motion to suppress was denied were not accepted because there was nothing in the record indicating that his motion to suppress was called to the attention of the trial court or a ruling obtained thereon.

Defendant did not point to any statutory language that was unconstitutionally vague and uncertain. There was nothing in the record that supported defendant's assertion that no prior judicial determination of probable cause was made with respect to whether the allegedly obscene material sold by defendant was in fact obscene. Moreover, because defendant did not raise this argument in his motions to quash, and did not obtain permission of the trial court to argue the issue on appeal, the court had no jurisdiction to consider it. The trial court's standard for &quot;obscenity&quot; did not use an unconstitutional &quot;average person&quot; standard to determine whether a work had serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.</SPAN></P>

The court held that these claims were insufficient to raise a material fact issue regarding the voluntary nature of appellant's payment. The appellate court held that the mistakes alleged were unilateral mistakes of law which were not an exception to the voluntary payment rule.

The jury assessed punishment at confinement for life for each offense. The person who fired the fatal shots testified at defendant's trial pursuant to a plea bargain agreement with the state. The court rejected defendant's argument that her convictions must be reversed because of insufficient evidence to corroborate the accomplice testimony, finding that the cumulative weight of the independent incriminating evidence was more than sufficient to corroborate the accomplice witness testimony. The court also held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting tape-recorded conversations between the accomplice and another person and in excluding testimony regarding prior violent acts by the accomplice. Because there was no specific finding that defendant used the deadly weapon herself, the court held that the trial court erred by including the affirmative finding. Thus, the court reformed the judgment to delete any mention of the affirmative finding and, as reformed, affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of possession of a controlled substance, cocaine, under 28 grams. The trial court imposed a probated sentence, then revoked defendant's probation and sentenced him to prison. Defendant's motion for new trial was denied without a hearing. On appeal, the court set aside the judgment revoking probation, the sentence, and the notice of appeal and remanded the case for a hearing on the new trial motion. The court concluded that the trial court erred in denying the new trial motion without a hearing because the hearing was a critical stage of the proceedings, the trial court abdicated its fact-finding function, and the trial court denied defendant the opportunity to make a record for review. The court ruled that defendant's statement, which constituted an unsworn declaration in substantial compliance with Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 132.001, 132.002, and 132.003, could be used in lieu of any sworn declaration, verification, oath, or affidavit requirement applicable to defendant's motion for new trial in a criminal case.

Penal Code Ann &sect; 43.23(c)(1) for selling obscene materials. A jury found her guilty and she was sentenced to six months confinement and a $ 500.00 fine, probated for one year. As a condition of probation she was also assessed 20 days confinement. Defendant appealed her conviction and sentence. The court affirmed and held that obscenity was not protected speech under Tex. Const. art I, &sect; 8, and that the Texas obscenity law was not unconstitutional. The court also held that even if the prosecutor's jury argument was improper, an instruction by the trial judge to the jury to disregard the improper argument was sufficient to cure the error. Reversible error occurred only when a statement to a jury was so inflammatory that its prejudicial effect could not reasonably be removed by such admonition. There was no reversible error.</SPAN></P>

In support of its ruling, the court held while the state could not justify at least 10 months of a year delay in bringing appellant to trial, appellant's rights were not violated as appellant did not assert any constitutional rights to a speedy trial. The court further held that even though the original motion on statutory speedy trial grounds was on file for a year, appellant did not request a hearing, urge the motion at any subsequent trial setting, or otherwise attempt to assert his rights to a speedy trial. The court also noted that while appellant experienced some prejudice from the delay, such prejudice was outweighed by appellant's failure to assert his right to a speedy trial on a basis upon which relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>

The boat the deceased was riding in included a motor manufactured by appellee. The court affirmed the judgment. Appellants failed to present any summary judgment evidence concerning appellee's alleged prior knowledge of the defect, and therefore, the court could not consider allegations of appellee's prior knowledge on appeal. With regard to the breach of warranty claim, the court held the action was barred by the four-year statute of limitations pursuant to Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. &sect; 2.725 (1968). The breach of warranty cause of action accrued when the engine was delivered. The court also affirmed the judgment with regard to appellants' negligence and misrepresentation claims because they were premised on the contention that appellee had prior knowledge of a defect.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the 232nd District Court, Harris County, Texas, that convicted him of aggravated sexual assault. Appellant claimed that the trial court erred in admitting outcry testimony under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.072 (Supp. 1988), that art. 38.072 violated the confrontation clause of the U.S. Const. amend. VI, and that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The outcry testimony was properly admitted under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.072 (Supp. 1988). Appellant contended that the outcry witness was not the first person the complainant had spoken to after the offense. This was true, as another person had asked the complainant whether appellant had done anything to her, and the complainant had answered no. But art. 38.072 was applicable to statements describing the offense. The first such statement made by the complainant was to the outcry witness, and it was thus admissible. Art. 38.072 did not violate appellant's confrontation right under U.S. Const. amend. VI. The law itself provided for sufficient indicia of reliability, and furthermore, the complainant had testified and had been cross-examined by appellant. The evidence was sufficient to convict appellant. The complainant testified that appellant had stuck his &quot;thing&quot; in her, and described him by name, and she was found coming out of his house.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction. Outcry testimony was properly admitted, as it related the first statement made by the complainant that described the offense.

The financing system provided that approximately 50 percent of the costs for each school district was to be funded from local property taxes, creating a disparity between wealthier and less wealthy districts. The court rejected the assertions of appellees, parents, teachers, and students of certain district, that the school financing system, supported by appellant state officials, violated equal protection rights, the due course of law, and the efficient school system provisions of the Texas Constitution. The court held that education was not a fundamental right and that wealth was not a suspect classification. Applying the rational relation test, the court found that the school financing system did not violate equal protection rights. The court held that the school financing system was authorized by Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment entered after a jury found him guilty of aggravated sexual assault. Shortly after appellant was taken into custody after running down a street naked and jumping into a river, police received a report that a suspect in a sexual assault had fled the scene naked. Police later found appellant's clothes and wallet in the house next door to complainants. The court found sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that a deadly weapon was used as complainant and her sister testified that they were cut by a knife during the attack and that the sister saw the blade, the injuries were shown in photographs, and a cutting instrument was used in the break-in. The court rejected the complaint that a photo spread was impermissibly suggestive as the sister made a tentative identification from the first set of photos depicting appellant with wet hair and a positive identification from a second set of pictures taken with dry hair. The court also found that appellant's statements made to an officer that directly refuted statements made at trial were properly admitted for impeachment purposes under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.22(1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment after rejecting appellant's points of error and finding sufficient evidence to support the jury finding that a deadly weapon was used in the commission of the offense, that under the totality of the circumstances there was not a substantial likelihood that a misidentification occurred, and that statements made to an officer were properly admitted at trial for purposes of impeachment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the 228th District Court, Harris County, Texas, that convicted and sentenced him for possession of cocaine. On appeal, he contended that the trial court erred when it admitted the written affidavits of two police officers because he did not waive in writing his right to cross-examine those witnesses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of possession of cocaine. On appeal, he challenged the trial court's admission of the affidavits of two police officers against him. The affidavits recited the facts given to the officers by an informant, the surveillance of appellant prior to his arrest, appellant's arrest, and the subsequent seizure of a briefcase that contained the contraband. No other evidence presented by appellee linked appellant to the contraband or established his knowing and intentional possession of it. On appeal, the court determined that the affidavits were improperly admitted during the guilt/innocence phase of the trial because they violated appellant's right to confrontation and cross-examination under U.S. Const. amend. VI . The relevant question was thus whether the admission of the affidavits constituted harmless error. Given that the erroneously admitted affidavits were the only evidence that affirmatively linked appellant to the contraband or established his knowing and intentional possession, their admission was not harmless. The trial court's judgment was thus reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court that convicted appellant of possession of cocaine was reversed. The trial court's admission of the affidavits of two officer's violated appellant's right to confrontation. Accordingly, without the admission of the affidavits, there was no evidence that affirmatively linked appellant to the contraband or established a knowing and intentional possession necessary for conviction of the charged offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Real party in interest's attorney (attorney) failed to learn that a matter had been dismissed for lack of prosecution until well after the statutory period of time allowing motions for reinstatement had elapsed pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 306a(1), Tex. R. Civ. P. 165a(3), and Tex. R. Civ. P. 306a(4). Nevertheless the attorney filed a motion for reinstatement, which was then granted by the trial court. Petitioner insurer sought a writ of mandamus and argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant reinstatement. The court granted the writ of mandamus and set aside the trial court's order of reinstatement. The court stated that while attorney had not received notice of the judgment, part of the reason for the lack of notice was attorney's lack of diligence. The court also stated that while the trial court had no jurisdiction to grant reinstatement, the attorney was not left without a remedy because the judgment could still be attacked in a bill of review procedure to prevent unjustness. Finally, the court stated that Tex. R. Civ. P. 165a and Tex. R. Civ. P. 306a were not violative of the open courts provision under Tex. Const., art. I, &sect;13.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a jury sentence following a conviction in the 198th District Court of Kerr County (Texas) for the offense of burglary of a habitation with the intent to commit aggravated assault. Following a plea of guilty, the jury assessed punishment. Appellant contended that an erroneous charge to the jury of the laws relating to parole was reversible error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to the offense of burglary of a habitation with the intent to commit aggravated assault. The jury assessed punishment. The trial court instructed the jury in regard to parole and the prosecutor made argument on the same subject, but both admonished the jury to not consider parole. On appeal, the court held that both the instruction and argument were error. Case law relieved appellant of the obligation of objecting at trial to the charge which contained the unconstitutional parole law instruction. It was unclear if appellant was likewise relieved of the obligation of objecting at trial to the prosecutor's improper comments. The court analyzed harm in light of Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2). The presumption that the jury followed the trial court's instructions not to consider the parole law, the prosecutor's clear admonishment to the jury to ignore the application of the parole law completely, together with the past violent assaults of appellant, convinced the court that the errors complained of did not affect the sentence. The court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the errors made no contribution to the punishment assessed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reformed the judgment to delete a reference to use of a deadly weapon as agreed by appellant and the state, but otherwise affirmed the judgment because although the trial court's instruction and the prosecutor's argument were in error for referring to the parole law, the court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the errors made no contribution to the punishment assessed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of public lewdness by sexual contact under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.07(a)(3) and Tex.

On appeal, appellant challenged the constitutionality of the statutes and the sufficiency of evidence for her conviction. The court affirmed, holding that because the statutes did not attempt to regulate constitutionally protected activity, appellant's facial overbreadth challenge was without merit. Appellant's vagueness challenge was also without merit because the statutes clearly proscribed both the acts committed by appellant and her knowing intent. There was sufficient evidence that appellant touched the officer's genitals, that she knew she was doing so, and that she did so to arouse his sexual desire, in violation of the statutes. The denial of appellant's motion to set aside the state's amended information which substituted the term &quot;groin area&quot; for the term &quot;genitals&quot; in order to comply with the statutes was proper because the there was no prejudice to appellant.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the evidence did not establish evidence to support a jury charge for the lesser-included offense of resisting arrest because the victim was not attempting to arrest defendant when the assault occurred. The court found that the indictment provided defendant notice, in ordinary and concise language, of the charge against him and the manner and means by which it was committed. The court concluded that the prosecutor did not improperly make a plea for law enforcement in his summation to the jury because he did not indicate the community expected or desired that defendant be convicted or punished.

The court found that the evidence was replete with accounts of defendant using the knife in his possession as a deadly weapon during the commission of both crimes. The court concluded that the challenged language in Tex.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a decision from the 185th District Court of Harris County (Texas), which convicted him of aggravated robbery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated robbery and sentenced to five years in prison after robbing a grocery store at gunpoint. The indictment alleged that the store's money belonged to the sacking clerk, who was present at the time but who did not own the money or hand it over to appellant. Appellant sought review, but the court affirmed the conviction, finding that the clerk, while not being the owner of the store's money, still had a greater right to possession of it under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 1.07(a)(24) (1974) than appellant. The court also found that the trial court erred in charging the jury on parole law during the punishment phase, pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a), but found that the error was harmless where the state recommended a sentence of 20 years and appellant received five. Finally, the court held that the testimony of the store manager's psychiatrist was properly excluded as improper bolstering of a witness, where appellant wished the psychiatrist to rebut the state's implication that the store manager had cooperated in the robbery and, thus, was lying in testifying that appellant was not the robber.</SPAN></P>

Further, the reviewing court held that the trial court properly charged the jury on the definition of &quot;prostitution enterprise.&quot; Lastly, the Court of Criminal Appeals had on many occasions ruled on the constitutionality of &sect; 43.04, and had specifically upheld &sect; 43.04 in the face of an argument that the term &quot;prostitution enterprise&quot; was vague and ambiguous.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction for criminal trespass under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 30.05 (1988) in the County Court No. 1, Galveston County (Texas), because he was passing out anti-abortion leaflets on school grounds and did not leave when asked to do so. Defendant complained that the application of the statute violated his free speech rights under U.S. Const. amend. I and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was distributing anti-abortion booklets to students on a high school campus. He refused to leave when a school official asked him to leave, and was arrested, tried, and convicted for criminal trespass under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 30.05 (1988). The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that because the school was a nonpublic forum, officials had the power to restrict speech and not violate U.S. Const. amend. V or Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The charging instrument was sufficient per Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 21.09. Defendant waived his argument that the information failed to allege sufficient facts because he failed to raise it at trial. School officials could testify that they would have let defendant leave his booklets at the school, because it showed that they were not trying to stifle his speech, and defendant had failed to object to such testimony earlier. There was no error regarding inflammatory remarks by the prosecutor. Defendant successfully objected at the time, and did not request a jury instruction or move for a mistrial. There was no need to prove any criminal intent beyond defendant's refusal to leave the property when asked to do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that because a school is a nonpublic forum, speech may be restricted more strictly. It was not defendant's speech being regulated, but his conduct. The information was not defective, school officials could testify about their willingness to let defendant place pamphlets on school grounds, and the statute's only mental state required defendant to intend not to leave when asked.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his convictions for aggravated assault and murder in the 338th District Court, Harris County (Texas), after waiving a jury trial and pleading guilty to the charges. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.15 (1977) and claimed he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to trial by jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and murder. The court affirmed the trial court's conviction. Defendant claimed that Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

Defendant also claimed that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because he was not informed of his right to put on evidence. The court held that art. 1.15 did not deny defendant any rights, and the trial court had jurisdiction. Defendant never claimed he tried to put on evidence. The court also dismissed defendant's argument that the trial court committed error in failing to inform him of the rights he was waiving by pleading guilty. The record showed that defendant waived his privilege against self-incrimination, his right to trial by jury, and his right to confront accusers. There was no requirement that he be presented with a laundry list of constitutional rights that were waived by a plea of guilty or that he make a separate waiver of each for the purpose of the record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's aggravated assault and murder convictions. The court held that the statute in dispute was not unconstitutional. The statute provided an additional safeguard not required by the United States Constitution, and defendant did not claim that he tried to offer evidence. Because defendant waived his rights in writing, it was not necessary for him to specifically waive each one separately.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant horse breeder sought review of a default summary judgment of the District Court of Lubbock County, 237th Judicial District (Texas), awarding appellee veterinarian a money judgment for boarding care, stud fees, and veterinary services rendered to appellant's mare, plus attorney's fees, and a foreclosure of a stableman's lien.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee veterinarian filed a motion for summary judgment in his action against appellant horse breeder for damages for breach of contract. Notice of the motion was served on appellant, but not on his attorney, who as a result, did not file a response until after the hearing date. After entry of a default summary judgment, appellant filed a motion for new trial, which the trial court denied. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the summary judgment standard set forth in the Craddock rule should apply with equal force to a motion for new trial following entry of a default summary judgment. The court concluded appellant had met that test. The record showed that appellant's failure to file a response to the summary judgment motion was not intentional but was the result of a mistaken assumption regarding the time allowed to answer. Appellant's motion for new trial and supporting affidavit were sufficient to establish the existence of fact questions requiring resolution by a trier of fact. The motion for new trial was filed at a time when granting it would not have occasioned delay or otherwise worked injury to appellee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment in favor of appellee veterinarian was reversed and the case remanded for trial. The trial court erred in denying appellant horse breeder's motion for new trial following default summary judgment. The motion and supporting affidavit set up a meritorious defense; the default did not result from conscious indifference; and the motion was filed at a time when granting it would not have caused delay or other injury to appellee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator directors sought a writ of mandamus to compel respondents, presiding and visiting judges of the probate court, to dismiss certain litigation for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and in the alternative to compel respondent, visiting judge, to vacate an order assigning himself as a visiting judge to preside over the litigation or to disqualify himself from so presiding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator directors sought a writ of mandamus to compel respondents, presiding and visiting judges of the probate court, to dismiss the litigation for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and to compel respondent, visiting judge, to disqualify himself from the litigation. The court concluded that the probate court lacked subject matter jurisdiction of the second through the fifth causes of action because the administrators brought those causes of action not as personal representatives of deceased's estate but as shareholders in trust for the estate and, therefore, those causes of action were shareholders' derivative actions. The court also found that Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 25.0022, governing the assignment of judges, was not unconstitutional because Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 1 gave the legislature broad and general power to establish and prescribe the organization of courts. Finally, the court found that Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 74.053 providing for the automatic disqualification of a judge upon a party's objection did not clearly and unambiguously apply to an assignment under the Tex. Gov't Code and, therefore, respondent, visiting judge, had no clear legal duty to disqualify himself.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted relator directors' petition only to the extent that it directed respondent, presiding judge of the probate court, to dismiss relators for lack of subject matter jurisdiction as to the second through the fifth causes of action because those causes of action were essentially shareholders' derivative actions. The court also found that respondent, visiting judge, did not abuse his discretion in assigning himself to the litigation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated robbery. Defense counsel (counsel) initially filed a notice of appeal; however, counsel failed to timely file a statement of facts and made numerous requests for extensions. Finally, more than two years later, counsel filed a six-page brief. The court noted that the brief only alluded to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction. More importantly, counsel failed to raise the fact that the jury instructions of the parole charge was declared unconstitutional more than seven months prior to the filing of the brief. Therefore, defendant's brief was defective and constituted actual error. The court struck defendant's brief because it failed to meet the minimum requirements of state and federal law and ordered rebriefing of the case. Furthermore, the court ordered that should the trial court choose not to appoint new counsel, it was instructed to conduct a hearing to determine whether counsel was capable of rendering effective assistance and to advise the court of its findings within 30 days.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court determined that, on appeal, defendant was receiving ineffective assistance of counsel. Defense counsel made numerous delays in filing his brief and failed to raise the issue that a jury charge had been found unconstitutional.

Similarly, the officer's testimony regarding his initial encounter with appellant, such that appellant was a dealer of a different type of drug, was admissible to allow the jury to understand the facts and circumstances surrounding the commission of the offense. The appellate court held that the evidence did not warrant a jury instruction of the defense of entrapment. Although the giving of the parole instruction, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 (1998) was error, it was harmless error because it made no contribution to conviction or punishment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded nolo contendere to the misdemeanor offense of obscenity and was assessed a punishment of three days confinement along with a fine. Appellant sought review, challenging the constitutionality of Tex. Pen. Code Ann. &sect; 43.21(a)(1)(A), and arguing that the evidence was insufficient because the state failed to obtain a prior adjudication that the magazine appellant possessed was obscene. On appeal the court affirmed appellant's conviction. The court stated that a determination of the statute's constitutionality had been previously upheld by the court of criminal appeals, which noted that the statute was not unconstitutional in its use of the terms &quot;prurient interest&quot; and &quot;patently offensive.&quot; Further, the court held that in appellant's motion to quash, he failed to assert that it was error for the trial court not to have a prior adjudication regarding whether the magazine was obscene. As such, the court was without jurisdiction to consider the issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for aggravated robbery. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in granting the state's motion to shuffle because the venire already had been shuffled once. Existing case law on the issue was in conflict. The court reasoned that each party had an equal right to a shuffle under Tex. Code. Crim. Proc. art. 35.11; therefore, no error occurred. Defendant had waived his objection to lack of notice relating to the trial court's grant of state's motion to shuffle because defendant's objection, on this ground, was not timely. Defendant argued that the prosecutor committed reversible error by discussing victim rights during argument at the punishment phase of trial. Prosecutor's comments were a proper reminder to the jury to consider defendant's prior conviction in determining his sentence and that such comments were harmless. Defendant also contended that the trial court erred in charging the jury on the law of parole. The court found that the manner in which the charge was raised was harmful to defendant. Therefore, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, but reversed his sentence for a new trial on punishment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found defendant guilty. Defendant appealed and argued that the trial court erred in denying her pretrial motion to quash because Texas Penal Code &sect; 43(B) violated the U.S. Const. amend. I, XIV. The court held that defendant failed to enumerate what part of the statute was vague, and defendant did not detail a risk or detriment to which she had been exposed without fair warning. Thus, defendant presented nothing for the court to review. The court concluded that defendant had failed to enumerate a single example of an unconstitutional application, and, therefore, the presumption of the statute's constitutionality remained unrebutted. Defendant made two additional arguments on the trial court' denial of her motion to quash, and the court held that defendant did not raise those particular arguments in her motion to quash, nor did she obtain the trial court's permission to argue so on appeal; thus, the court lacked jurisdiction to address defendant's argument, and the conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Art. 581-29 required sellers of securities to be truthful and provide investors with all material facts, thus allowing them to make informed decisions. On appeal the court affirmed appellant's conviction, holding that the Act was constitutional because appellant was given fair notice that his conduct was forbidden by the statute. Moreover, the court held that appellant's U.S. Const. amend. V argument was meritless because neither the United States Constitution nor the Texas Constitution provided a cloak protecting criminal fraud. The court further held that the self-incrimination clause was not applicable because the Act required appellant to disclosure material facts to purchasers of securities.

The victim slammed the door into the chair of defendant's companion. A fight ensued, and defendant walked up behind the victim, shot him two times, and killed him.

The court held that defendant did not show that the jury failed to follow this instruction, and the fact that defendant's sentence was lower than the maximum punishment corroborated the presumption that the jury followed the curative instruction. The court concluded that the erroneous instruction did not affect defendant's conviction or punishment, thus the error in submitting the instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and made no contribution to the punishment assessed pursuant to Tex.

Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in refusing to dismiss the jury panel and grant a new trial following several of the prosecutor's remarks during voir dire. However, the court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion and that the errors were harmless. Defendant raised several points of error in relation to the trial court's charge to the jury, which the court found to be without merit. The court rejected defendant's argument that it was error for the jury not to take the jury charge and verdict form into the jury room pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 36.18 (1979). The court determined that penitentiary packets were properly admitted into evidence during the punishment stage of the trial. The court found the jury charge on punishment was unconstitutional, but determined that the error was harmless. The court found no error in either side's closing arguments. Since the court found no merit in defendant's numerous points of error, the court determined that defendant was not deprived of a fair trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.01(a)(5) of disorderly conduct by intentionally making unreasonable noise in a public place when he refused to turn down the volume on his stereo. Appellant sought reversal and challenged the statute under which he was convicted as being unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Appellant also contended that the judgment did not reflect the jury's verdict as to the fine assessed by it. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that the statute was constitutional. The court found that appellant's conduct fell clearly within the proscribed activity of the statute, and that he knew that his conduct was prohibited. Therefore, the court determined that the statute did not impede any of appellant's constitutionally protected conduct, nor was it impermissibly vague as to appellant's conduct. Further, the court reformed the judgment to reflect the fine that the jury assessed in their verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, school district, county, and city, sought review of a decision of the 236th District of Tarrant County (Texas), which rendered judgment for appellee church and held that the tax exemption application procedure violated appellee's right to the free exercise of religion under U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, school district, county, and city, filed suit against appellee church for delinquent taxes owed on property owned by appellee and used for a private school. The trial court held that procedure for claiming tax exempt status violated appellee's rights to the free exercise of religion under U.S. Const. I and entered judgment for appellee. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found that by substantially complying with the procedure for claiming tax exempt status, appellee ceded its constitutional complaint. Since appellee did not participate in an appeal to the appraisal review board to protest the assessment, appellee was foreclosed from contesting the validity of the assessment on factual grounds. Appellants established a prima facie case of delinquency and were entitled to delinquent taxes. Thus, the court rendered judgment for appellants. The court found that while the evidence of the religious use was conflicting, there was some evidence that the entire tract was used for religious worship on a regular basis. The evidence amounted to more than a scintilla and was ample enough that the jury's findings thereon were not manifestly unfair.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and rendered judgment for the delinquent taxes for the tax years 1982 through 1986, and affirmed that portion of the judgment stating that appellants, school district, county, and city, take nothing for the tax years 1977 through 1981. By substantially complying with the procedure to claim tax exempt status, appellee church ceded its constitutional complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the order of the 168th District Court of El Paso County (Texas) which convicted him of indecency with a child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant teacher was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment for indecency with a child, his student. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed because appellant's &quot;running objection&quot; did not preserve for review the admission of the victim's outcry statements to her mother. The court held that the statements were ripe for inclusion in the substantive evidence of the offense and that the child's case-in-chief testimony satisfied appellant's confrontation right. The court could not review the sufficiency of evidence, absent a recorded description of the scope of the victim's demonstrations regarding the misconduct. The court held that the testimony of the state's rebuttal witnesses, who were the victim's classmates at the time of the incident, were admissible for impeachment of appellant's testimony that he was unlikely to commit the charged offense and his overbroad assertion that nothing was ever done in his classroom to sexually arouse the victim. The court held that the testimony was admissible to show that the indicted and extraneous offenses were connected to a common criminal scheme to progressively exploit the teacher-student relationship.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction for indecency, because appellant waived objection to the admission of outcry statements, the child was subjected to full cross-examination before the jury, a sufficiency of the evidence review was unavailable from the record, and the trial court properly admitted extraneous offense testimony for the impeachment of appellant's testimony and as proof of a common criminal scheme.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of two counts of indecency with a child in the trial court. The complainants, aged 7 and 10 at the time of trial, were appellant's daughters. Appellant sought review of the convictions. The court affirmed the trial court. The court held that evidence of an extraneous offense regarding appellant's prior inappropriate sexual conduct directed toward the complainants was properly admitted because it placed the charged offense in context. The probative value of the extraneous offense outweighed any possibility of prejudice. The court ruled that an unconstitutional jury instruction concerning the parole laws that was given to the jury pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07(4)(c) was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that the state properly introduced evidence of the long-term effects of the offense on the complainants because appellant failed to preserve error and the trial court instructed the jury to disregard the questions. An objection by appellant to a witness's testimony about the coaching of the complainants' testimony was made after the question was asked and answered, which was too late to preserve error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a decision of the 228th District Court of Harris County (Texas), which convicted appellant of robbery, on grounds that the trial court improperly denied appellant's motion for a continuance under Tex.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of robbery and the jury found the enhancement paragraphs to be true and assessed a punishment of 70 years confinement. Appellant sought review of the conviction. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court that convicted appellant. The court held that the trial court properly denied appellant's motion for continuance on the day of trial pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 29.06 (1966). Appellant's motion for a continuance failed to comport with the requirements of art. 29.06 because the motion did not mention the subpoenaed witness and there was no evidence that appellant exerted any effort to secure service on the subpoenaed witness other than the instanter subpoena. The motion also failed to state what material facts were expected to be proved, that the witness was not absent by appellant's procurement or consent, and that the motion was not made for purposes of delay. Appellant was not denied the right to confrontation and cross-examination because appellant failed to show on the record why the cross-examination of the complainant about bias was relevant.
