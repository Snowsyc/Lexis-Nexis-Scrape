</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon certification from the New Mexico Court of Appeals, appellants, State and defendants already subjected to civil forfeiture under Controlled Substances Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 30-31-1 to -41, challenged judgments, alleging double jeopardy violations under N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 15, and N.M. Stat. Ann. 1978, &sect; 30-1-10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In five consolidated appeals, criminal defendants filed motions to dismiss criminal drug charges against them, based upon attachment of their right against double jeopardy under N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 15, and N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-1-10 (1978), alleging that civil forfeiture under the Controlled Substances Act (Act), N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 30-31-1 to -41, was penal in nature and thus, since the State had elected to obtain forfeiture before seeking criminal punishment, the State could not seek a second punishment in a criminal proceeding. In two cases, defendants' motions were granted and the State appealed. In three other cases, defendants' motions were denied, and defendants were convicted of narcotics charges. Upon certification, the Supreme Court of New Mexico reversed the convictions and affirmed the dismissals of the charges, holding that, unlike federal jurisprudence, civil forfeiture under the Act was punishment for purposes of New Mexico's protections against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three convictions were reversed, and dismissals of criminal charges were affirmed, because civil forfeiture of property, such as vehicles and currency allegedly associated with the crime, was punishment and was limited by the protections against double jeopardy guaranteed by the New Mexico Constitution and the state's double-jeopardy statute.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued, among other things, that there was insufficient evidence to prove the charge and aggravating circumstances against him, and that the trial court erred in instructing the jury and in sentencing him. The court found sufficient evidence to sustain the charge, because the force used to kidnap was not typical of attempted rape, and additional force was used to kill the girl. The court found that the jury had been properly instructed, and a death sentence was proper, because the aggravating circumstances, murder in the commission of a kidnapping and murder of a witness, had been properly weighed against the mitigating circumstances of defendant's remorse and his age.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed for relief from defendant's curfew that curtailed late-night activities of juveniles. Because none of the plaintiffs were stopped, arrested, cited, or prosecuted for violation of the curfew, defendant claimed that they lacked standing to challenge the ordinance. On appeal the court held that one need not first expose oneself to actual arrest or prosecution to challenge a criminal statute's constitutionality. The Children's Code, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32A-1-1 et seq., and the Delinquency Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32A-2-1 et seq., preempted defendant's curfew because it established criminal sanctions of incarceration and fines for juvenile activity which was not unlawful when committed by adults. The enforcement program was likewise invalid which authorized police to take children into custody without either a court order or a fact-specific showing to meet the conditions of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32A-3B-3(A)(4). The court was unwilling to expand the award of attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his death sentence and conviction for the murder of a nine year old girl pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-20A-4(A) from the District Court of Grant County (New Mexico).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his death sentence and conviction for the murder of a nine year old girl pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-20A-4(A). Many issues were raised on appeal, including an allegation that the trial court erred in striking potential jurors based on opposition to the death penalty, that the trial court erred in restricting presentation of mitigating evidence and in admitting evidence of the circumstances of the crime including victim impact testimony, and that his sentence was disproportionate. The court rejected defendant's contentions and affirmed. Absent a manifest abuse of discretion, which was not present, the court refused to disturb the trial court's decision to exclude jurors based on their opposition to the death penalty. Also, the trial court's jury instructions did not unduly limit the jury's review of mitigating evidence. The trial court properly excluded evidence directly related to proportionality when that issue was to be left to the court on appeal. The trial court's admission of victim impact evidence and the crime's circumstances were consistent with the Capital Felony Sentencing Act, and defendant's sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

In addition, evidence directed related to proportionality was properly excluded, and the admission of victim impact evidence and the crime's circumstances were consistent with the Capital Felony Sentencing Act.</SPAN></P>

The court found that plaintiffs were not entitled to an award of attorney fees or costs on appeal and affirmed the decision that plaintiffs' constitutional rights were violated. The court found that the district court did not err in declining to award attorney fees and rejected plaintiffs' argument that the private attorney general doctrine applied.

The court issued the writ of mandamus vacating respondent commission's order because the end result of the order was to deregulate the retail side of the electric power industry in the state in a manner inconsistent with the regulatory scheme that respondent commission was charged with administering, and, thus, respondent commission unlawfully intruded on the province of the state legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of vehicular homicide and other charges. Defendant's conviction was reversed after an appellate court concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in changing the trial's venue. The state appealed, arguing that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that a fair trial could not be guaranteed in the county where the crime was committed and that the county where the trial was held was more likely to be free from exception. The court ruled that when moving for a venue change over defendant's objection from the district in which the crime allegedly occurred, the prosecution must prove with clear and convincing evidence that a fair trial in that district was a practical impossibility. Further, the court held that the trial court must apply a reasonable-probability standard of proof when balancing conflicting claims regarding the likelihood of a fair trial in a venue. The court reversed the judgment, concluding that it was reasonably probable that the publicity surrounding the case tended to solidify the opinions of so many residents of the county where the crime took place that the trial's fairness in that community was questionable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversing defendant's conviction was reversed, and the judgment convicting defendant was affirmed, where substantial evidence supported the reasonable probability that a fair trial could not be obtained in the county where the crime took place, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by ordering a venue transfer to the county where the trial was held, and defendant failed to present evidence that the trial jury was biased.</SPAN></P>

The jury also assessed punitive damages against appellee. By directed verdict, the trial court awarded appellee $ 1,645,708 on its counterclaim for unpaid premiums by appellant. The trial court granted appellee's motion for remittitur. On appeal, the court held that, when a trial court granted a motion for remittitur or new trial in the alternative, a party could accept the remittitur under protest and appeal directly, with certain requirements set by the trial judge. The covenant of good faith and fair dealing could be enforced for a failure to disclose. The jury award of punitive damages in the amount of $ 4,500,000 was not unconstitutional or otherwise excessive.

The district court allowed appellant taxpayers to intervene as of right. The district court permanently enjoined enforcement of the rule. Appellants challenged the order, and the intermediate appellate court certified the issue to the court. The court concluded that the rule violated N.M. Const., art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two consolidated cases, plaintiff injured persons brought separate tort claims against defendant city pursuant to the New Mexico Tort Claims Act (TCA), N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-4-1 to 4-27 (1996). The District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico) invalidated the TCA cap and permitted recovery of the injured persons' full damages. The district court disallowed the injured persons' claim for post-judgment interest. All parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In both cases, the injured persons were awarded amounts exceeding the caps under the TCA. The injured persons challenged the constitutionality of the damages limitation in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-4-19(A), arguing that the cap violated their rights of equal protection under the New Mexico and United States Constitutions. The court held that the court previously should not have adopted intermediate scrutiny for the analysis of the claims. Instead, the court held that the rational basis analysis should have been applied, and such analysis was to have applied to such cases in the future. However, the law-of-the-case doctrine and principles of equity required application of intermediate scrutiny to the case because that standard was posited in the court's previous orders in the case. The court concluded that the city failed to meet its burden of proving a substantial relationship between the cap and an important government interest. The TCA cap did not implicate the right of access to the courts. Rational basis scrutiny was the appropriate equal protection analysis to be employed. Equal protection rights were not affected so substantially that intermediate scrutiny was warranted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the finding of the district court, invalidating the TCA cap and permitting recovery of the injured persons' full damages, but disallowing their claim for post-judgment interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to N.M. R. App. P. 12-102, the state appealed an order of the New Mexico Court of Appeals which reversed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for a new trial based upon the trial court's failure to administer the jury's oath found in N.M. Unif. Jury Instructions-Crim. 14-123 to the jury before it delivered its verdict. The court granted certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with vehicular homicide. A jury was impaneled, then dismissed without being sworn. The trial court conducted the trial a few weeks later and did not administer the jury's oath at that time; however, the trial court gave a pretrial instruction regarding the jury's duty to decide the case on all the evidence and to follow the law as fair and impartial jurors. After defendant was convicted and sentenced, defendant's counsel advised the trial court that the jury had never been sworn and filed a motion for a new trial. The trial court denied the motion after administering the oath and then questioning the jurors on their verdict. Defendant's counsel admitted that he was aware, during the trial, that the jury had not been sworn, stating that his failure to advise the trial court was a tactical move. The appellate court reversed, holding that the failure to swear in the jury was reversible error and could not have been waived by defendant. The court reversed, holding that defendant knowingly waived the jury oath and that the jury had complied with the oath that would have been given. Because defendant perpetuated the error, the conviction was not a nullity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff gamblers sought review from the New Mexico Court of Appeals, which certified this case to the court, in which the district court granted dismissal to defendant financial entities on the grounds that the Indian gaming tribes were indispensable parties and that plaintiffs did not state a claim for which relief could be granted. Defendant government entities sought dismissal on the same grounds plus federal preemption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After consolidating plaintiff gamblers' two cases, the court held that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1166, did not preempt state law claims because defendant government entities did not overcome a presumption favoring state police power due to the fact that during the relevant time, Indian gaming was illegal both on and off the reservation, as no valid gaming compact was in effect. The court asserted that within reservations the federal government was responsible for dealing with gaming violations and outside the reservations defendant government entities were responsible. The court held that the Indian gaming tribes were indispensable parties, but because of sovereign immunity they could not be joined, so the court reversed the trial court's failure to dismiss plaintiffs' claims against defendant government entities and affirmed the dismissal of defendant financial entities. The court concluded that because the requested relief would stop all Indian gaming funding and there were no protective provisions to insulate the tribes from an adverse judgment's effects, litigation could not continue. All claims were dismissed under N.M. R. Civ. P. Dist. Ct. 1-019.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed all of plaintiff gamblers' claims with respect to both defendant government entities and defendant financial entities, affirming the trial court's dismissal of defendant financial entities and reversing the trial court's failure to dismiss defendant government entities. The Indian gaming tribes could not be joined because of sovereign immunity, so because they were indispensable parties, the cases were dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that 1) the PEBA regulated public employees, 2) the institution would suffer no hardship nor injustice were it required to open the collective bargaining process to additional employees, 3) the grandfather clause of PEBA did not apply to the relevant portion of the institution's policy because it did not extend the right to all employees who were afforded that right under the PEBA, and 4) the collective bargaining requirements did not violate N.M.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant election contestees sought interlocutory review of a judgment of the district court of Taos County (New Mexico) that entered summary judgment for appellee election contestants on their consolidated actions that contested two separate elections of several individuals to the seats of commissioner and mayordomo for an irrigation ditch association.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee election contestants pursued a consolidated action contesting 1994 and 1995 elections of several individuals as officers for a local ditch association. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, and appellant election contestees sought interlocutory appeal. Because appellees failed to file a notice of election contest within the statutory mandate of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-2-2(G), the court remanded the 1994 election contest for dismissal. Appellees' 1995 contest was timely, so the court when on to evaluate whether appellees were entitled to relief relative that election. The court noted that the plain language of the relevant statute&nbsp;N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 73-3-3 provided that voting in ditch elections could be conducted based proportionately on interested persons' water rights, based proportionately on ditch ownership, or based on a majority of those using the ditch for the distribution of water. The parties disputed the manner in which the ditch association had chosen historically to conduct elections. In view of this genuine issue of fact, the court reversed the grant of summary judgment of the 1995 election and remanded the matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's grant of summary judgment on appellee election contestants' ditch election contest action was reversed and the matter remanded for a grant of summary judgment and remanded for further proceedings. The district court lacks jurisdiction over the 1994 election, so only the 1995 election was remanded for a determination as to whether the subject election administered in accordance with historical practice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state legislators filed a motion to hold respondent governor and respondent Secretary of the New Mexico Human Services Department in contempt of court, alleging that the governor and secretary were continuing to implement their public assistance changes despite a writ prohibiting such practice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor and secretary continued to implement public assistance changes despite a writ prohibiting them from doing so. The governor and the secretary argued that their actions were necessary to prevent the loss of federal funding for the state's welfare program. The court reasoned that the governor and the secretary did not have the discretion to continue their plan, which was found to have been unconstitutional as a violation of the state constitution's separation of powers clause. Moreover, it determined that they had more than adequate notice and were advised to comply with the previously entered writ. The court found that the governor and the secretary had not complied with the writ and, therefore, held them in indirect civil contempt. The court found that the most appropriate contempt sanction was an order directing the governor and secretary to cease and desist immediately from implementing their public assistance program within seven days.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought review and contended that his right to be protected from double jeopardy was violated. The court held that, to determine whether multiple punishments had been imposed unconstitutionally, it was required to inquire whether the conduct underlying the offenses was unitary, and if so, it was to determined whether the legislature intended to create separately punishable offenses for the unitary conduct. The court found that, because the conduct underlying the felony-murder and the robbery charges was unitary, convictions for both was in violation of the double jeopardy clause. The court held that defendant's conviction for felony murder was correct because the killing was apart from the consideration of the underlying felony. The court affirmed the convictions for felony murder and tampering with evidence and vacated the conviction for robbery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant's girlfriend was in the shower, the defendant penetrated her baby's anus. He also struck the baby's head, killing her. The defendant asserted that his girlfriend killed the baby. The court held, inter alia, that 1) due to the baby's unstable health and her head injuries, a rational jury could have found that the defendant committed the crime of criminal sexual conduct of a minor under circumstances dangerous to human life, thus supporting his felony murder conviction, 2) a rational jury could infer that the baby's head injuries were intentionally inflicted where a physician testified that the fracture was caused either by striking the skull against a hard object or by shaking the child and hitting her skull against a hard object, 3) there was sufficient evidence to prove that the murder was committed during the commission of the criminal sexual contact, 4) the evidence supported the remaining convictions, 5) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting autopsy photographs because they were more probative than prejudicial, and 6) the felony murder and criminal sexual contact were sufficiently distinct to warrant convictions for both.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions for felony murder and criminal sexual contact in the third degree, remanded the case with directions that the conviction for intentional child abuse resulting in death be vacated, and that the judgment and sentence be amended to reflect sentences for both criminal sexual contact of a minor and felony murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant stabbed victim to death, defendant was convicted of felony murder, second-degree murder, armed robbery, two counts of aggravated battery, and numerous other crimes.

Defendant's multiple convictions violated defendant's right to be protected from double jeopardy. The court affirmed his felony murder conviction. Defendant's remarks to the hostage negotiators in a suicide attempt were voluntary. The court affirmed one of his convictions for aggravated battery. A struggle was an intervening event between the initial battery and the acts that caused victim's death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While petitioner was in an Ohio prison, he incurred the animosity of prison officials by becoming a jailhouse lawyer and an advocate for the rights of Native American inmates. After he was placed on parole, he was warned by his parole officer to stop speaking out against the prison system and the parole board or his parole would be revoked. Petitioner was also told by inmates that if he was returned to prison, the prison personnel would cause him death or great bodily harm. After a minor incident, petitioner was advised by his parole officer that he would have to wait until after he was back in prison before he could present evidence of his innocence to the parole board. He then fled the State of Ohio and challenged his extradition from New Mexico. The trial court granted him a writ of habeas corpus and the court affirmed. It found that petitioner was not a fugitive from justice because the conduct of the State of Ohio forced him to flee the State under duress, as the persuasive and uncontroverted evidence reflected that petitioner left Ohio because he risked death or great bodily harm at the hands of prison officials if he had reported to be arrested by his parole officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of aggravated assault, criminal penetration, and false imprisonment, after the trial court precluded evidence of the victims' prior sexual conduct, pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-9-16, and N.M. R. Evid. 11-413. The New Mexico Court of Appeals reversed the verdict, holding the preclusion deprived the defendant of his U.S. Const. amend. VI right to confrontation, and granted him a new trial. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the rape shield law, codified as N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-9-16, and the corresponding rule prevented the admission of the prior sexual conduct by the victims, because the defendant failed to show (a) that the evidence was material and relevant, and (b) that its probative value equaled or outweighed its inflammatory or prejudicial nature. The court initially agreed with the rationale of the appeals court that a defendant's right to confrontation required admission of prior sexual conduct of an alleged rape victim, thereby overruling the rape shield law, if the defendant's case were built on a premise whereby evidence of prior sexual conduct was probative of the defense. However, a bare claim that the victim was a prostitute did not satisfy the test for admission. The defendant never expressed his intention to use the prior sexual conduct evidence to expose the victims' motives to lie or as a basis for a theory of relevance other than propensity, which was insufficient to overcome the rape shield law. On that reasoning, the court held that the appeals court erred in reversing the trial court's verdict and its sentencing of the defendant for sexual assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appeals court's order, reversing the defendant's conviction and sentence for aggravated sexual assault, and remanded the matter to the appeals court for determination of other issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While investigating a double murder, the police were informed that defendant, a 16-year-old female with a history of mental and emotional problems, wished to confess something to them. Defendant was advised of her Miranda rights, stated that she understood them, waived her right to remain silent, and adamantly refused to have either an attorney or her mother present for her statement. In a motion to suppress, defendant claimed that her confession was inadmissible because, given her age and mental condition, she could not have voluntarily waived her Miranda rights. The court denied defendant's motion to suppress, and the jury convicted defendant on two counts of first degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, aggravated robbery, unlawful taking of a motor vehicle, and tampering with evidence. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that defendant was not entitled to a statutory presumption of involuntary waiver because she was older than 14 years old. Further, under the totality-of-circumstances test, the state proved that defendant's confession was given voluntarily after a valid waiver of her Miranda rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Chaves County District Court (New Mexico), which convicted him of first-degree depraved mind murder under N.M.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that his intoxication could be considered in determining the mental state required for conviction of depraved mind murder. The court held that a fact finder may consider evidence of extreme intoxication when determining whether defendant possessed the requisite mental state of subjective knowledge for depraved mind murder. The evidence of intoxication could be considered to reduce first degree depraved mind murder to second-degree murder, but could not be used to reduce it to lesser offenses or to completely excuse defendant from the consequences of his unlawful act. The court found that there was sufficient evidence that defendant was intoxicated to raise the question of whether he actually possessed the subjective knowledge or the requisite awareness that his acts were greatly dangerous to the lives of others. The trial court committed reversible error in refusing to give defendant's instruction on intoxication because the evidence at trial supported the giving of the instruction on his theory of the case.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 8, cl. 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers sought a refund of corporate income taxes paid to the state tax department (department) on dividends received from the taxpayer's foreign subsidiaries. The department's hearing officer denied the refunds and upheld an assessment for underpaid taxes. The court of appeals upheld the constitutionality of New Mexico's formulaic corporate tax scheme. The department argued that the application of the formula remedied the differential treatment of domestic and foreign commerce under the New Mexico tax scheme by thus reducing the taxable income base. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment because the department's tax scheme violated the Foreign Commerce Clause of the U. S. Constitution. The court found that dividends received by the taxpayers, parent corporations, from their foreign subsidiaries were taxed; however, dividends received from domestic subsidiaries were excluded entirely from the parent's tax base. The court noted that none of the taxpayer's foreign subsidiaries conducted business in New Mexico and both taxpayers filed state corporate income tax returns as separate corporate entities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the court of appeals decision and found that the department's corporate income tax scheme on the dividends received by the taxpayers from foreign subsidiaries was unconstitutional.

Ann. &sect; 34-5-14(B)(3) and (4) (1990), appellant workers challenged the constitutionality of the New Mexico Workers' Compensation Act of 1978, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 52-1-1 to -70 (1991) (Act), under which each was denied the level of permanent partial disability benefits (PPD) sought.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The workers contended that there was insufficient evidence to support the workers' compensation judge's finding regarding the date on which they reached maximum medical improvement (MMI), and the value assigned to them for residual physical capacity. One worker was employed as a staff nurse by appellee hospital when she sustained an injury to her back. She received an impairment rating of zero percent from her medical care provider, which rendered her ineligible for further workers' compensation benefits. The second worker suffered from pain in her arm, shoulder, and back, which impaired her capacity to work. Her treating physician established that she had reached MMI with an impairment rating of five percent. The workers contested the mandatory use of the American Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (AMA Guide), alleging that the AMA Guide was not developed to determine the impact of an individual's impairment on his capacity to work. The court held that the mandatory application of the AMA Guide did not violate equal protection and that the workers' compensation judge's findings were supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the worker's compensation judges' determination of the proper level of benefits available to both workers, concluding that all challenged portions of the New Mexico Workers' Compensation Act were constitutional and the judge's determinations were supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient filed a malpractice claim against defendant radiologists for failing to properly diagnose a cancerous mass in her lung. A state district court of New Mexico dismissed her complaint as barred by &sect; 41-5-13, the three-year statute of limitations of the Medical Malpractice Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-5-1 to -29 (1978). The New Mexico Court of Appeals certified the patient's appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient asserted that her cause of action did not accrue until she learned that the cancer had metastasized and that &sect; 41-5-13 barred her action before it had accrued. She alleged that it violated equal protection and her due process right of access to the courts as found in U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV, &sect; 1 and N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 18. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the patient's claim was barred by &sect; 41-5-13. The section violated neither the Equal Protection nor the Due Process Clauses. Under the rational-basis test, it was reasonably drafted to further a legitimate government interest. Also, the three-year time limit established a reasonable termination point for medical malpractice claims. The section operated as a statute of repose and was reasonably related to important governmental interests. The plain language of the section demonstrated that it was an occurrence rule, and the cause of action ran from the date of the act of malpractice. Thus, the patient's cause of action did not accrue when the metastasis was discovered. Moreover, she did not exercise diligence when she first learned that she had been misinformed about the mass in her lung.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the patient's medical malpractice claim as barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 31-9-1.5 against one defendant, contended that the NMMIC was constitutional. The court held that the NMMIC was not unconstitutional. The court also held that any alleged deficiency in the treatment rendered to incompetent criminal defendants was not due to alleged unconstitutionality of the NMMIC. Rather, without defining the particular treatment for each defendant, the NMMIC properly required treatment to be administered by qualified professionals. Thus, any claim that treatment was insufficient would have been properly directed to those responsible for its specific design and administration. The court noted that it also had considered specific arguments made on behalf of individual defendants and the court concluded that its disposition of the common constitutional arguments made it unnecessary to address any of the specific arguments unique to any particular defendant.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 383-9 (1978), refused to recognize litigants' disqualification requests. He also made a practice of recusing himself from cases reassigned to him following the peremptory challenge of any other judge in the district. A litigant petitioned for a writ of superintending control or, in the alternative, for a writ of mandamus requiring the judge to exercise his constitutionally and statutorily mandated judicial function to hear a reassigned case. The court issued a writ of mandamus and, upon the judge's disobedience, initiated contempt proceedings by a show cause order. The court sanctioned the judge after he admitted that he had intentionally disobeyed the mandamus order. The court observed that the judge's behavior, which included intemperate language, had seriously damaged public esteem for the judiciary in general, in violation of N.M. Code Jud'l Conduct 21-200(A).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Retirees appealed from a summary judgment entered in favor of state which dismissed a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of retirees who received a pension prior to January 1, 1990 under the Public Employees Retirement Act, the Judicial Retirement Act, the Magistrate Retirement Act, and the Educational Retirement Act. The court affirmed because the four statutory retirement programs did not grant retirees private contractual rights; thus, no right to the repealed tax exemptions and no impairment of contract under either the New Mexico or Federal Constitution existed. The programs created a property interest in the individual contributions which vested after acquiring the minimum number of service credits, but these vested rights did not include a repealed tax exemption.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the court was whether the governor's authority to regulate the state fiscal policy was to be measured solely by the specific statutory and constitutional prohibitions against incurring liabilities without general funds to meet those liabilities. The court granted petitioners' application for a writ of mandamus. The court found that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-3-6 (1978) did not specify that allotments for agencies whose needs were efficiently measured as a constant throughout the fiscal year were to be made in 1/12 increments. The court reasoned that to withstand a constitutional challenge, &sect; 6-3-6 had to be interpreted to require that periods and amounts of allotments be designed to meet the constant needs of governmental agencies to achieve the purposes of appropriations. The court noted that the governor's fiscal policy in the instant case was not related to those needs, but was instead related to the prudent maintenance of the general-fund reserves. Thus, the court concluded that &sect; 6-3-6 standing alone was insufficient to authorize the governor's regulation of state fiscal policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.M. Stat.

Yet, N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 10 proscribed payment of any other compensation to legislators beyond the permitted per diem and mileage allowance. The attorney general had sought injunctive relief, among other things, barring future payments under the plan. The court of appeals held that the legislative retirement benefits constituted compensation in violation of N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 10. The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals, and opined that said court did not consider the contingent nature of retirement benefits. The court found that the legislative retirement benefits paid out under the plan were not included within the terms &quot;compensation, allowance or perquisite,&quot; as used in N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 10, because such benefits were too remote and contingent. Under the plan, a legislator must have accumulated the requisite number of years of credited service before any benefits would vest and must have remained alive until the earliest time that the benefits would vest.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the deadly weapon defined the quality and nature of the armed robbery, and the objects and results of the stabbing and theft clearly united. The court found that the legislature did not intend multiple punishments. The court held that defendant could not have been convicted of felony murder unless the state proved all of the elements of armed robbery; the elements of armed robbery thus were subsumed by the elements of felony murder in the course of an armed robbery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, two state legislators and a taxpayer, filed a verified petition for writ of mandamus or writ of prohibition and declaratory judgment alleging that respondent, a state governor, entered into revenue sharing agreements on gaming with various Indian tribes, contrary to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2701-2721.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners alleged that the governor lacked the authority to commit the State of New Mexico to the agreements, because he attempted to exercise legislative authority contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers expressed in N.M. Const. art. III &sect; 1. The court determined that the agreements authorized more forms of gaming than the law permitted, and that amounted to an enactment of new laws and amendment of existing laws, a power reserved for the legislature. It held that it was necessary to join the Indian tribes as parties because the mandamus was directed to the governor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued the peremptory writ and stay. It stayed all actions to enforce, implement, or enable any and all of the gaming compacts and revenue-sharing agreements executed by the governor, and directed the governor and all other state officials subject to his authority to proceed in conformity with the views of the court in the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sought review of a judgment of the District Court of Eddy County (New Mexico), which dismissed her complaint under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 against defendants, school district and board of education (collectively district). The district sought review of the trial court's decision, which denied an award of damages to the district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee sought review of the trial court's order which dismissed her action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 against the district for wrongful termination on the basis that the district could not be sued under &sect; 1983. The district appealed the trial court's decision, which denied damages to the district. The court held that the trial court improperly dismissed the employee's &sect; 1983 action. The court found that local school boards were &quot;persons&quot; for the purposes of &sect; 1983, and they were local governing bodies with political and fiscal autonomy. The court held that the action was not barred by any statutory governmental immunity in New Mexico. The court held that although the employee could sue the district, she could not prevail on the merits of the case because the district terminated her for cause and in a manner conforming with due process. The court held that the trial court correctly awarded costs to the district as the prevailing party. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of damages to the district because the trial court properly exercised its equitable powers to bar recovery on a finding of only negligent behavior by the employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed in part, but affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court concluded that the district was not absolutely immune from suit under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. On the merits, the district showed that the employee received due process and was therefore entitled to recover its costs in defending the suit. The court found that the district could not recover damages based solely on the employee's negligent behavior.</SPAN></P>

The court held that its original ruling was in error because: (1) fear of arrest was not sufficient to support an assault claim; (2) the officer had a reasonable belief upon the facts that it was necessary to separate the individual from the towing company employee precluding the false imprisonment and unlawful detention claims; (3) there was no intention by the employee to permanently deprive the individual of his property but rather the property was kept until the possessory lien was satisfied; and (4) the officer was entitled to qualified immunity as to the claims of breaking and entering, unlawful search, and violation of property rights because the facts did not show that the officer violated clearly established law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent natural father and his girlfriend had three children. His girlfriend placed their youngest child for adoption against respondent's wishes. The adoption took place over his objection. The trial court entered a final decree terminating respondent's parental rights and granting the adoption. The court of appeals reversed finding that the record did not support a finding that respondent was unfit, and that termination of his parental rights on grounds of the child's interests alone, absent a showing of parental unfitness, failed to satisfy constitutional due process. The court agreed in the decision to void the adoption, but remanded for the trial court to determine the best interests of the child. The trial court's judgment was influenced by an error of law because there was no express finding of fact indicating that respondent either intended to abandon the child or that he was an unfit parent. The evidence supported the conclusion that respondent did not bear responsibility for the disintegration of his relationship with his son. Any presumption of abandonment that arose under state law was rebutted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parent's contended that the three-year statute of limitations in the Medical Malpractice Act, N.M. Stat.

The court reversed the decision finding that &sect; 41-5-13 deprived the parent's of due process. The court found that the parent's could not demonstrate that &sect; 41-5-13 drew a classification which discriminated against them in the exercise of their claimed interest in access to the courts because it did not discriminate against the parent's child based on his status as a medical malpractice plaintiff. Section 41-5-13 did not violate N.M. Const. art.

The court found that the length of incarceration facing defendant before he could have been considered for parole, as an alternative to a death sentence, was information that must have been provided to a jury before it deliberated on the capital charge if defendant decided it was in his best interest to have the jury apprised of this information. The court found that to withhold this information after it was requested violated defendant's due process right to have accurate information presented to the jury to rebut the prosecution's case for death.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent school employee was terminated from employment with applicant school board pursuant to termination procedures in N.M. Stat. Ann. 22-10-17.1 (1993). The trial court affirmed an arbitrator's award that terminated the employment. The court reversed and remanded the order because it determined that the overall statutory procedure, calling for compulsory arbitration of school employment disputes, was constitutional, but that the limitation on judicial review in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-10-17.1(M) (1993) was not. The court determined that the statutory arbitration process was compulsory rather than voluntary, and therefore the school employee had a right to procedural due process because there termination affected his property rights. The arbitration process was determined to be constitutionally fair, but the judicial review, restricted by N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-10-17.1(M) (1993), did not comport to either procedural due process or separation of powers between branches of government. The court held that on remand the court was required to apply de novo review of questions of law and substantial-evidence review of findings of fact for the compulsory arbitration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendants argued that the general rule limiting appeals following guilty pleas to jurisdictional issues was inapplicable where they expressly had conditioned their guilty pleas by reserving the right to appeal a specific nonjurisdictional issue. As an initial matter, the court noted that the state's rules of criminal procedure neither expressly authorized nor prohibited the use of conditional guilty pleas to reserve specific issues for appeal. The court then held that an issue of sufficiency of the evidence might be reserved for appellate review, particularly where the following critical requirements for a conditional plea were met: each defendant expressed an intention to reserve a particular pretrial issue for appeal and neither the prosecution nor the trial judge opposed such a plea. The court then found that as each defendant properly preserved the sufficiency issue for appeal, each had entered a valid conditional plea and the issue was reviewable on appeal. Accordingly, the court reversed the affirmance of defendants' convictions, allowed defendants to withdraw their guilty pleas, and remanded the causes so that the convictions could be set aside.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was injured in the course of her employment when she fell from a vertical conveyor-belt manlift after its top-limit switch failed to properly stop the device. The victim brought an action against the company and others involved in the manufacture, sale, distribution, and installation of the manlift. The trial court determined that the manlift was a physical improvement to real property and that the victim's claim against the company was barred by the 10-year limitations period of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37-1-27 (Repl. Pamp. 1990). The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the company. The victim contended that &sect; 37-1-27 violated her equal protection and due process rights. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order. The court determined that rational basis scrutiny, rather than intermediate scrutiny, applied to assess the constitutionality of &sect; 37-1-27. The court held that &sect; 37-1-27 was constitutional. The court found that the legislature's objective in enacting &sect; 37-1-27 was permissible and rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. The court also ruled that &sect; 37-1-27 was not applied retroactively to the victim's case.</SPAN></P>

Ct. 5-104(B)(2) could be used to extend the time for such a filing, because no extension of time had been requested. The court agreed that under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-21-21, the trial court had discretion to modify conditions of probation in appropriate cases. It concluded, however, that the trial court abused its discretion by changing the conditions of defendant's probation. The changed condition was part of a valid plea bargain agreement which was binding on both parties. The trial court could not amend or modify the sentence imposed pursuant to the valid plea agreement in such a way that allowed one party to renege on its part of the agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county filed a petition in the district court to condemn the property owners' property for highway improvements. The county filed its petition under the Special Alternative Condemnation Procedure established by N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42-2-1 to -24 (1978). The county filed a petition for a preliminary order of entry, entered the property, and began work that included removing soil from the property.

The district court entered an order making the preliminary order of entry permanent. The jury returned verdicts in favor of the property owners and the district court entered judgment on the verdicts. The property owners appealed. The appellate court certified the appeal to the court, stating that its resolution required a determination of the proper date for valuing property taken in a condemnation proceeding.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a petition for certiorari review with the court after he was convicted of two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor (CDM) in violation of N.M.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court were the issues of whether the uniform jury instruction for contributing to the delinquency of a minor (CDM), in violation of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-6-3 (Supp. 1992), was deficient, and whether it was error for the trial court to refuse to instruct the jury on the offense of indecent exposure before a minor as a lesser included offense of CDM. The court held that the trial court's jury instruction to find defendant guilty of CDM if his acts encouraged each of the girls in question to conduct herself in a manner injurious to her morals, health, or welfare adequately reflected the CDM statute because the legislature's earlier and subsequent use of injurious conduct to define juvenile delinquency or establish juvenile court jurisdiction did not limit the use of injurious conduct for purposes of CDM. Furthermore, the court found that defendant was not entitled to an instruction on indecent exposure as a lesser included offense of CDM because indecent exposure required that the acts take place in &quot;public view&quot; and there was no such element in the CDM statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court affirmed and held that convictions on both charges based on unitary conduct did not violate principles of double jeopardy, that the state was not required to present evidence beyond the defendant's act to support a conviction for contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and that the act of the defendant need not actually have caused delinquency. The court found that the two crimes each required proof of a fact that the other did not. The court determined that the legislature intended for the crimes to be separate crimes, punishable separately even when unitary conduct violated both statutes, thus, defendant's claim that his convictions under both statutes violated double jeopardy principles was rejected. The court also found that the state was not required to present separate evidence that the defendant's act contributed to the delinquency of a minor. The court concluded that although contributing to the delinquency of a minor required proof of a fact that was not required to prove criminal sexual contact of a minor, that did not mean that the different facts could not be proved by the same evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court held that while federal courts recognized the good-faith exception under the federal constitution, the exception was incompatible with the guarantees of N.M. Const. art.

The court held that the purpose and basis for the state's exclusionary rule was incompatible with any exception based on the good-faith reliance of the officer on the magistrate's determination either of probable cause or of the reasonableness of the search.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of embezzlement and attempting to traffic cocaine after he failed to return $ 250 to an undercover police officer who, as a part of a police &quot;sting,&quot; gave defendant the money and requested that defendant purchase cocaine for him. Defendant appealed his convictions to the New Mexico Court of Appeals, which pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-5-14(C), certified the appeal to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the jury instruction given on embezzlement given was deficient because it failed to instruct the jury on all of the essential elements required under N.M.

The instruction failed to include the requirement that at the time of the conversion of the property at issue, defendant entertained a specific intent to deprive the owner of the property. Although defendant failed to object to the instruction at trial, the court found that the instruction constituted fundamental error. Therefore, the court reversed the embezzlement conviction. However, the court affirmed defendant's conviction for attempting to traffic cocaine, holding that there was substantial evidence to support the conviction. Defendant's acceptance of the money to purchase cocaine was an overt act in furtherance of the goal crime of trafficking in cocaine; the crime of attempt could be established based on this act. Finally, the court rejected defendant's claim that double jeopardy principles mandated that he could not be punished both for embezzlement and attempted trafficking, noting that the same conduct was not being used to support both charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, juvenile probation officers (JPOs), challenged the decision of the District Court of Otero County (New Mexico) that granted the summary judgment motion of defendant, State Personnel Board, with respect to the JPOs' allegations that the Board violated Section 47(C) of the Youth Authority Act and impaired their contract in violation of N.M.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court also dismissed the JPO's illegal diminution of compensation claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Pursuant to the Youth Authority Act, N.M. Laws, ch. 101, &sect; 47(c) (1988), N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9-2A-5 (Supp. 1992), the JPOs were transferred from the judicial branch of the state government to another branch. They argued that according to the act, they continued to accrue annual vacation leave at judicial rates. The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that the judicial branch rates of accrual for annual leave were not preserved by the act's grandfather clause and that no unconstitutional impairment of contracts or diminution of compensation resulted. The court, using general rules of statutory construction, concluded that the rate of accrual of annual leave was not an &quot;accrued benefit&quot; under the plain meaning and structure of Section 47(C). The court explained that statutes fixing the compensation or terms of public employment were presumed merely to establish public policy subject to legislative revision and not to create contractual or vested rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered a question of law certified by the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit after appellant trustee sought review of an order of the trial court in favor of appellee wife authorizing the sale of joint tenancy property held by appellee and the debtor spouse in the debtor's bankruptcy action. Appellant claimed that an amendment to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-3-8 (1978) applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An involuntary bankruptcy petition was filed against debtor spouse and appellee wife. The petition was dismissed against appellee. A judgment authorizing the sale of the parties' joint tenancy property was reversed. Appellant trustee claimed that a statutory amendment allowed treatment of joint tenancy property as community property. The court found that the savings clause indicated legislative intent of retroactivity, that retroactive application did not violate the New Mexico Constitution, that community debts were satisfied from all community property including joint tenancy property, and that the state's marital property laws presumed that all property acquired during the marriage was community property. The court held that the amendments to the statute were applied retroactively to treat joint tenancy property as community property includable in debtor's bankruptcy estate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the amendment to the New Mexico community property statute characterized joint tenancy property as community property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals (New Mexico), which affirmed his conviction for child abuse under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-6-1(C) (Repl. Pamp. 1984). Defendant contended that the provision in the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutional because it improperly criminalized ordinary civil negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-6-1(C) (Repl. Pamp. 1984) of child abuse involving no death or great bodily injury after he cut his nephew's neck with a knife during an altercation. The court of appeals affirmed the conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the statute required at least a showing of criminal negligence. Where N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-6-1(C) (Repl. Pamp. 1984) had been interpreted to criminalize innocent conduct, although negligent in the civil sense, that interpretation was held to be erroneous. All opinions that were inconsistent in any way with that analysis regarding criminal negligence were expressly overruled. While the trial court committed error in failing to instruct the jury on a criminal negligence standard, no rational jury could have concluded that defendant cut his nephew's throat without satisfying the standard of criminal negligence. As the element of criminal negligence was established by the evidence, the error in instructing the jury on a civil negligence standard instead of a criminal negligence standard was not reversible error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for child abuse involving no death or great bodily injury was affirmed in the absence of reversible error. The standard of criminal negligence adopted in the opinion was ordered to govern all cases pending on direct review, provided the issue was raised and preserved, and all cases pending but in which a verdict had not been reached.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the District Court of Grant County (New Mexico), which convicted him of first degree felony murder, aggravated burglary, attempted robbery, and battery and sentenced him to life imprisonment for the murder conviction. Defendant claimed he was denied effective assistance of counsel in violation of U.S. Const. amend. 14 and N.M. Const. art. II &sect; 14.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A woman was found beaten and murdered. Hairs that did not match the victim were found in her mouth and on the bed. A man contacted police and relayed defendant's story of murdering the woman. Defendant was convicted of first degree felony murder, aggravated burglary, attempted robbery, and battery and was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder conviction. The court affirmed, holding that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel under U.S. Const. amend. 14 and N.M. Const. art. II &sect; 14 when the trial court denied his motion for a continuance because he had nearly a year to prepare for trial and suffered no prejudice without showing that any of his defense theories had a reasonable probability of success. Defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court's refusal to exclude a detective from the courtroom during trial because the detective already knew what the witnesses would say from his investigation. Graphic photographs were relevant to show defendant had the requisite intent to kill. There was no evidence of pretrial publicity that prejudiced the jurors to support a change of venue. The trial court's felony murder instruction was not fundamental error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentence because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's request for a continuance where he had nearly one year to prepare his case and was not prejudiced by the continuance. Defendant's counsel was not ineffective by failing to obtain an expert in forensics or hair analysis. The trial court did not err by allowing expert testify regarding hairs collected from the scene.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Board contended that its members were entitled to qualified immunity from principal's suit which alleged that board had violated her First Amendment rights when it declined to renew her contract because of her criticism of board at a public meeting. The court held that the issue of board members' objective reasonableness in engaging in the challenged conduct, as measured by reference to clearly established law at the time the conduct occurred was a legal issue and that summary judgment was an appropriate means for invoking the trial court's ruling on the question. Further, denial of summary judgment conclusively determined board members' claim of right not to stand trial on the allegations and thus, under the collateral order doctrine, the denial of summary judgment was reviewable. The court held that it could not see how the decision not to rehire principal could be characterized as anything other than an infringement of her First Amendment rights and there was no evidence of any adverse effects to board from her speech. Thus, board members had to submit relevant evidence at trial on how their interest outweighed principal's interest in commenting on public matters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state representatives sought a writ of mandamus to direct the secretary of state to submit multiple questions to the voters for the capital projects in the 1992 Capital Projects General Obligation Bond Act, 1992 N.M. Laws, ch. 103, &sect;&sect; 1-17. The state representatives argued that multiple questions were required by N.M. Const. art. IX, &sect; 8. The court agreed and directed the secretary of state to submit multiple questions to the voters. The court noted that N.M. Const. art. IX, &sect; 8 required that debts for specified works or objects be submitted to the voters and that this provision was intended to prevent logrolling, which was the combining of multiple projects to achieve the passage of all. Because the projects combined under the Act did not naturally relate to each other, the court concluded that they could not be considered in a single submission to the voters. The court found that there was an alternative multiple grouping of projects under the Act that had a more natural relationship to each other and that the submission of these multiple groupings to the voters would be constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the portion appellee excluded from the contribution in aid of construction was reasonable and was supported by substantial evidence because appellee properly balanced the investor and ratepayer interests. The court found that the customers should not have to pay for the water system through rate payments because they paid for the installation of the system when they bought their lots.

The judge entered an order denying the election to excuse and the company petitioned for a writ of mandamus. The court denied the petition, holding that the company invoked the discretion of the court by requesting an extension of time within which to answer or otherwise plead, and that the company was then prohibited from peremptorily challenging the judge. The court held that an extension of time to answer or otherwise plead was a discretionary act, even if in response to the agreed motion or stipulation of the parties, and pointed out that the rule that a judge may not be peremptorily challenged after a party has invoked the discretion of the court depended, actually, not upon whether the court in fact exercised discretion, but depended upon whether the response of the court was subject to discretion. The court explained that the judge could have granted or denied the agreed motion for extension of time, therefore, his entry of the agreed order was subject to discretion and not a mere ministerial act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Appeals (New Mexico) affirmed the summary judgment granted in favor of respondent health care provider on petitioner patient's medical malpractice claim. The matter was before the court on the patient's petition for a writ of certiorari. The patient argued that her claim was not barred by the statute of limitations set forth in the Medical Malpractice Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-5-13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1984, the patient underwent surgery at the health care provider's hospital. In 1990, the patient filed a medical malpractice suit alleging that the surgeons and the nurses failed to remove a sponge from her abdomen during the 1984 operation. The complaint joined the health care provider under the theory of respondeat superior. The intermediate appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment that that the patient's claim accrued at the time of the wrongful act and that the three-year statute of limitations set forth in the Medical Malpractice Act (act), N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-5-13, barred her claim against the health care provider. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 41-5-13 did not apply to the health care provider because &sect; 41-5-5(C) limited the act's benefits to qualified health care providers, &sect; 41-5-13 was a benefit under the act, and the health care provider was not qualified under &sect; 41-5-5(A) of the act. The court further held that the patient's claim, which fell outside the act, accrued when she knew or should have known of her injury and its cause and that it was specifically within the trial court's province to determine when the patient had made that discovery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents had a joint custody arrangement, with most times spent with custodial parent. The custodial parent claimed that requiring her to remain in one state with the child restricted her rights under the constitution to be free to travel as she saw fit. The court said that when the parents operated under a joint custody arrangement and one of them sought to alter the arrangement, it made perfectly sense to impose a presumption in favor of the parent who wished to continue to operate under the joint custody decree and to place on the party wishing to change the decree the burden to produce evidence that the arrangement is no longer workable and needs to be changed. Finally, the court said that either party could have initiated a proceeding to alter an existing custody arrangement on the ground that a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child occurred, or was about to occur, and the party seeking such change always would have the burden to show that the existing arrangement was no longer workable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both cases involved a lengthy delay between the filing of the habeas corpus petition and the ultimate disposition in the district court. The court found that the district court was chiefly responsible for the numerous delays, failures to act, and inappropriate orders that caused the inordinate delays. The inmates argued that the delays entitled them to default judgments on their habeas corpus petitions. Although the court concluded that a default judgment might be appropriate in an extreme case for the state's failure to respond to a writ of habeas corpus, the court declined to impose that remedy in favor of either inmate in the instant action. The court proceeded to consider the merits of both petitions in order to bring the protracted proceedings to an end. The court reversed the denial of one inmate's petition and remanded his case for resentencing because he was not given notice prior to his sentencing hearing of the state's intention to seek enhancement of his basic sentence under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-18-15.1. The court dismissed the second inmate's petition, finding no merit in his claim of entitlement to sentencing credit for time served on a separate Georgia offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had a history of mental illness and drove her car into a family, killing one member and injuring two others. The sole issue at trial was whether she was criminally insane. The jury returned a verdict of guilty but mentally ill. Defendant argued that there was no difference between those found not guilty by reason of insanity and those found guilty but mentally ill; they were similarly situated, yet they were treated differently. Thus, because it did not create a rational classification, the guilty but mentally ill verdict violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and New Mexico Constitutions. On appeal, the court found that the classification was rational. It allowed those mentally ill who did not have the capacity to form the appropriate criminal intent to avoid criminal liability, and provided criminal liability for those guilty because they possessed the criminal intent, yet who were mentally ill. The court held that although the classification created two classes of mentally ill defendants, those classes were not similarly situated and their legislative creation was not arbitrary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In accordance with the jury verdict, the District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico) convicted defendant of two felony murders, two first-degree kidnappings, armed robbery, attempted armed robbery, and several counts of conspiracy to commit murder, kidnapping, and robbery. Defendant was sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment for the murders and a total of 87 years' imprisonment on the remaining felonies. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After meeting two &quot;rich&quot; girls in a park, defendant and co-defendant convinced them to drive to a vacant lot to wait for an expected cocaine delivery. In exchange for use immunity, co-defendant testified that defendant stabbed the girls to death. Although he was found not guilty of first-degree murder, defendant was convicted of all other charges, including felony murder. The state supreme court held that the felony-murder statute required proof that defendant intended to kill. Nevertheless, the felony-murder verdicts were affirmed because there was sufficient evidence that defendant caused the victims' deaths, either through his own acts or those of an accomplice whom he helped and encouraged, and with the intent to commit the killings or with knowledge of a strong probability of death or great bodily harm to each victim. The kidnapping convictions were upheld because both victims were held for service to benefit defendant by being induced, by deception, to accompany him to a remote location as part of an overall plan. The kidnapping and murder convictions did not merge because the conduct underlying the offenses was not unitary. Defendant's other grounds of error lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-7A-1(F) (Michie Cum. Supp. 1990), as amended 1991 N.M. Laws ch. 255.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 60-7A-1(F) provided for an election in &quot;eligible counties&quot; on whether a retailer was allowed to sell or deliver alcoholic beverages at any time from a drive-up window. An &quot;eligible county&quot; was one that had reported motor vehicle statistics to the state highway and transportation department informing the state that it had convicted more than 25 persons for each 1,000 licensed drivers of driving while intoxicated. The county named in the suit was near large reservations of Native Americans where alcohol was not sold. The county also had substantial alcohol-related health problems and deaths. The owners of the liquor stores argued that the statute was unconstitutional because there was no evidence that alcohol abuse was greater in their county than in other counties in the state and because there was no proof that the alcohol problem was based on drive-up windows. The court held that: (1) the statute was special legislation; (2) there was a rational relationship between the statute's classification and the evil it was designed to prevent; (3) the statute did not violate the equal protection clause; and (4) the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant brewery sought review of the trial court's grant of summary judgment and damages to appellee alcohol beverage director. Appellant's predecessor filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, alleging that the price affirmation requirement violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The trial court entered a preliminary injunction temporarily and then issued a memorandum opinion granting summary judgment to appellee. The United States Supreme Court issued opinions, which changed the law on the subject of pricing affirmation requirements. The parties moved again for summary judgment, which the trial court granted in favor of appellee. On appeal, the court concluded that retroactive application of the Supreme Court opinion to the case at bar would serve no purpose advanced by the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. Further, the court found that the trial court was justified to regard any retroactive application of the case as potentially productive of both inequitable results and harm to the state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With the utility faced with excess generating capacity, the Commission fashioned a remedy that required exclusion of a facility from the utility's rate base. Pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 62-9-5, the utility filed an application for abandonment and decertification of its interest in the facility. When the Commission denied the application, review was sought, and the court affirmed. After upholding the Commission's use of decertification factors in its consideration of the interests of both the utility and consumers, the court held that because the operative question had turned upon the facility's use, &sect; 62-9-5 had authorized decertification only upon a finding that present and future public convenience and necessity did not otherwise require such use. In upholding the Commission's findings and its refusal to authorize decertification, the court held the utility: 1) had failed to show the facility was not needed for future public convenience and necessity; and 2) had failed to support its claim of financial harm. Finally, the court held that refusing to decertify the utility's interest, while at the same time excluding it from the rate base, was not an unconstitutional taking.</SPAN></P>

It was alleged state's advisor knew of the limitations on purchases and advised them. Insurers issued bonds covering state employees for unfaithful performance of their duties.

State appealed contending certain provisions asserted against the sovereign violated public policy and should have been declared void. The court held public policy considerations did not exist requiring it to negate that contractual provision. State did not offer evidence to demonstrate contract was unconscionable, one of adhesion, or that it was in an unequal bargaining position. State did not present a cognizable claim within the required period as the illegality was discovered almost immediately after purchase. It was held the purchase violated N.M. Const. art.

There was no need to merge the offenses for sentencing. The assault with the candle was distinct from the sexual intercourse.

The trial court had entered a default judgment of forfeiture against the claimant. In a second case, petitioner state sought review of a judgment of the court of appeals, which reversed the trial court's denial of respondent claimant's motion to set aside a default judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cases involved forfeiture proceedings initiated by state entities under the Controlled Substances Act. The court granted certiorari to consider whether execution on a forfeiture judgment divested an appellate court of jurisdiction to consider an appeal from the judgment. In the first case, the claimant did not file a supersedeas bond to stay execution of a default judgment of forfeiture. In the second case, neither the claimant nor his counsel was given notice of the state's application for default judgment. The appellate court held that it had jurisdiction to hear the appeal because the default judgment had been improperly entered. The court reversed the appellate court's judgment in the first case, remanding the case to the appellate court because the inability to post a supersedeas bond could not have operated to deny the right to a stay. The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment in the second case on the issue of appellate jurisdiction. The court held that when a state entity initiated a forfeiture proceeding, thereby invoking the jurisdiction of the courts of New Mexico, those courts retained in personam jurisdiction until all appeals had been exhausted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first case, the court reversed the judgment of the appellate court, which granted the city's motion to dismiss the claimant's appeal of a default judgment of forfeiture under the Controlled Substances Act. The case was remanded to the appellate court. In the second case, the court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court, which reversed the trial court's denial of the claimant's motion to set aside a default judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff New Mexico Life Insurance Guaranty Association (Association) filed suit against defendant securities firm for state securities violations and other claims relating to the Association's reimbursement for claims it paid for an insolvent insurer. The District Court of Santa Fe County (New Mexico) denied in part and granted in part the securities firm's motion to dismiss. The securities firm filed an interlocutory appeal and cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Association was a statutorily created agency that paid the claims of state residents against insolvent insurers that transacted business in the state. The Association alleged that the securities firm sold insurance policies as a security and sought to recoup the money it had paid out as well as costs, attorney fees, and other damages. The court held that the question of whether the policies were securities under the New Mexico Securities Act (Act), N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 58-13-1 to -47 (Repl. Pamp.1984), was a disputed issue of fact. It found that the Association was a proper party to the action and that it could sue for all the claims held by the policyholders. The anti-fraud provisions of the Act did apply. The trial court properly ruled that the New Mexico Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Law, N. M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59A-42-1 to -16 (Repl. Pamp.1988), violated the First Amendment and was void as applied to commercial speech. Last, the court found that the New Mexico Unfair Trade Practices Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 57-12-1 to -16 (Orig. Pamp.1978), applied to transactions subject to the New Mexico Unfair Insurance Practices Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59A-16-1 to -30 (Orig. Pamp.1984).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and held that a cause of action could be maintained under the New Mexico Unfair Trade Practices Act and the New Mexico Unfair Insurance Practices Act.

Defendant appealed. The appellate court certified questions for the court's review. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and held that by defining CSCM as &quot;unlawfully and intentionally&quot; touching a child's intimate parts, the legislature properly intended that the state had to establish the unlawfulness of the touching as a distinct element of the offense. The court also found that defendant did not waive his claim of error based on the absence of an instruction on unlawfulness, which was an essential element of the offense of CSCM, despite the fact that he objected to an instruction that might have cured the error. The court concluded that the omission in the jury instructions was a fundamental error that required reversal. The case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The proceeding considered treatment of other capacity in addition to the three units of the nuclear generating station. The capacity included, inter alia, a contract between the PNM and a consortium of three municipalities. The PSC's final order also excluded this contract from the PSM's jurisdictional rates. On appeal, the attorney general and the energy consumers organization claimed that aspects of the final order were not supported by substantial evidence, were arbitrary and capricious, exceeded the jurisdiction of the PSC, and violated the constitution. The court affirmed and held that the PSC acted within its jurisdiction. The court ruled that the final order neither conflicted with the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 791-828, nor the supremacy clause.

The court held that the legislature did not intend the 20-day time requirement of N.M. Stat.

The court also found that given that a tort occurred and that an injury has resulted, parents were entitled to claim damages for physical and emotional pain and suffering associated with pregnancy, but not for emotional or psychological pain and suffering resulting from the presence of an additional family member.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the District Court of Eddy County (New Mexico), which convicted and sentenced him after a jury trial of rape of a child, criminal sexual contact of a minor, and one count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Defendant pleaded nolo contendere to four other counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court imposed the basic sentence for each of defendant's convictions, enhanced each due to aggravating circumstances, and ordered the sentences to run consecutively for a total of life in prison plus 14 years. The court affirmed the judgment and the sentence. The court held that the criminal statute of limitations was properly tolled during defendant's voluntary absence from New Mexico pursuant to former N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-1-9(A) (1953, Repl. Vol. 1964), N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-1-9(A) (1978, Repl. Pamp. 1984). Defendant's constitutional rights to travel and to equal protection were not violated because the tolling provision simply subjected him to responsibility for a longer period of time because of his voluntary choice to leave the state. The five-year limitations period for contributing to the delinquency of a minor did not have to be charged because it was not an essential element of the crime. Jury instructions were not erroneous because they tracked the language of the respective statutes. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing evidence of one of the defendant's nolo contendere pleas to impeach him and did not err in enhancing his sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Medical Malpractice Act (Act), N.M. Stat.

Even though the statute of limitations had expired, the district court denied the hospital's motion to dismiss the complaint. The court of appeals reversed, and the patient and his wife sought review of the decision. The court reversed the court of appeals and affirmed the district court's denial of the hospital's motion to dismiss. The court found that if the patient and his wife were required to file in district court at the peril of losing their case before the classification of the health care provider was known, then every claim would be filed in district court as a safety precaution, and the purpose behind the Act, which was to prevent court filing of nonmeritorious malpractice claims, would be defeated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, mortgagee and mortgagee's agent, challenged the judgment of the District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico), which declared that appellant's ban on prepayment of appellee mortgagor's loan could not be enforced in light of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-7-19(A) (1983). Appellants claimed that the statute violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellee mortgagee was not permitted by appellants, mortgagor and mortgagor's agent, to prepay its loan, appellee sought a declaration that it had the right to prepay and that the prepayment penalty was unenforceable under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-7-19 (1983). The court entered a judgment and declared that appellee could prepay the loan. The court affirmed and held that the plain language of &sect; 48-7-19 mandated that the prepayment penalty was unenforceable whether or not there had been a sale of the property and whether or not the lender had sought to exercise its options under a due-on-sale clause. The Garn St.Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, 12 U.S.C.S. 1701j-3(b)(1), did not preempt the enforcement of clauses concerning the prepayment of loans or prevent a state from enlarging the class of loans subject to the prohibition on prepayment penalties, so long as they were real property loans made or assumed during the window period.  N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-7-19 promoted the alienability of land to withstand challenge under the Contract Clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the district court that held a prepayment penalty sought to be imposed by the mortgagee and mortgagee's agent was unenforceable against the mortgagor. A statutory prohibition on prepayment penalties applied whether or not there had been a sale and whether or not the lender had sought to exercise its options under a due-on-sale clause and was constitutional under the Contract Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that the Commission's denial of its application was not supported by substantial evidence, was arbitrary, was domestically biased against appellant in violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1981, 1983, and that the Commission erred in assessing costs against appellant. The court agreed in part. The Commission's finding that intervenor provided sufficient evidence of public need for its services and that appellant did not was improper. Public need was a fact, not the exclusive property of an applicant. Accordingly, appellant was deprived of substantial evidence necessary to support its application. Similarly, the Commission's failure to consider the consolidated record on public need was arbitrary and constituted an abuse of discretion. The civil rights claims were not preserved for review. The record supported the Commission's finding that there was a public need and necessity for the services to be rendered by appellant and intervenor. Therefore, on remand the Commission was directed to make a comparative review of the whole record. N.M. State Corp. Comm'n. R. P. 64 required appellant to pay appellate record preparation costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sub-contractor provided materials for a public works project. The contractor defrauded appellees governmental entities and became defunct without paying the sub-contractor. The sub-contractor sought recovery from the governmental entities for unjust enrichment. The District Court of Santa Fe County (New Mexico) dismissed the complaint as barred by sovereign immunity under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37-1-23. The sub-contractor sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sub-contractor argued that a claim for unjust enrichment was not a claim based on contract that was barred by the immunity provisions of &sect; 37-1-23. The sub-contractor argued that liability for unjust enrichment was fundamentally different from liability grounded in either tort or contract and that unjust enrichment provided a third, analytically distinct basis for liability, which fell outside the &sect; 37-1-23 grant of immunity to claims based on contract. The court rejected this argument and affirmed the ruling and reasoning of the district court. The court found that &sect; 37-1-23 was intended to reinstate sovereign immunity to actions based on contract. The court found that an action brought on the theory of unjust enrichment implied an obligation where, on the basis of justice and equity, the law imposed a contractual relationship between parties, regardless of their assent thereto. The court held that, even though an action for unjust enrichment was not based on contract in a strict theoretical sense, it was so closely related to an action that was based on contract that the provisions of &sect; 37-1-23 should be construed to extend immunity to such a claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that dismissed the complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lived with the mother and her two children. The mother left the children in defendant's care when she attended school. The second day of school, defendant phoned her and stated that her son had broken his arm and was unconscious. The child died several hours later. Medical evidence showed that the child had been injured over 90 percent of his body and that there had been three separate penetrations of the child's anus. Defendant was charged with first-degree murder, three counts of CSPM, two counts of CSCM, 16 counts of child abuse resulting in death, and four counts of child abuse not resulting in death. Defendant was acquitted on one charge of CSCM and four charges of child abuse, and was found guilty of the remaining counts. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the evidence supported only one of the two charges against defendant of child abuse not resulting in death and only one charge of child abuse resulting in death. These offenses merged into the greater offense of first-degree murder. Both the Fifth Amendment and N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 15 precluded the imposition of multiple punishments for one offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Certiorari was granted to petitioner claimant who sought to challenge a decision from the Workers' Compensation Division (New Mexico), which determined that the claimant was permanently and totally disabled. No lump sum payment was granted, but the state was to continue to pay her medical bills. Her disability payment was unchanged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant argued that she was barred from appeal because she did not receive notice of the decision until 35 days after the final order was filed, and five days too late for her to appeal. The court held that the claimant's counsel was aware of the ruling of the court, but not the exact date of the filing of the order. The claimant's counsel received notice of the court's ruling in October, and notice of the denial of attorney fees orally from the bench. After receiving notice of the court's ruling on the merits, counsel was not required to wait until the order was filed before he filed his appeal. Under N.M. R. App. P. 12-201(A) (1986), counsel could have immediately filed an appeal, pending the filing of the court's decision. Further, the court noted that while Rule 12-601 allowed appeals from workers' compensation decisions within 30 days from the filing, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52-5-8(A) (1978) allowed such appeals within 30 days from mailing. Because the rule and the statute involved procedural matters, and rules adopted by the state supreme court governed over an inconsistent statute, N.M. R. App. P. 12-601 (1986) governed over N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52-5-8(A) (1978).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the Workers' Compensation Division. The claimant's counsel had notice of the court's ruling on the merits prior to the filing of the court's order, and counsel could have filed his appeal pending the filing of the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of first-degree murder, criminal sexual penetration, kidnapping, aggravated burglary and larceny. The victim was an 89-year-old widow. The jury, in sentencing defendant to death for first-degree murder, considered three aggravating circumstances. The court found no merit in defendant's attack on his convictions. However, the court reversed the death sentence and remanded the case for resentencing on the first-degree murder conviction because the trial court erred in rejecting defendant's proffered jury instruction to the effect that a person sentenced to life imprisonment would be eligible for parole in 30 years, and in allowing the jury to consider murder during the commission of a kidnapping as an aggravating circumstance. The option of prior sentencing on noncapital offenses was a valid option available to a defendant who requests such sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In connection a restaurant's construction, a claim was brought against the subcontractor and others. The subcontractor filed a cross-claim against the mortgagor and restaurant to foreclose its materialmen's lien or recover in quantum meruit. The trial court granted summary judgment to the mortgagor and restaurant, ruling that &sect; 48-2-10.1(E) prohibited lien claims by materialmen when the general contractor was not licensed by the state. The subcontractor appealed and the mortgagor answered, arguing that the subcontractor did not have a lien against nonresidential property. The court reversed the judgment, although it ruled that the protections of &sect; 48-2-10.1 were limited to residences with no more than four dwelling units and did not apply to nonresidential property. Section 48-2-10.1(E), however, did not preclude the subcontractor from filing a valid materialmen's lien under &sect; 48-2-2. The court did not reach the quantum meruit claim, but it ruled that remand was necessary. Questions of fact remained on the relative priorities of various liens and interests on the restaurant property and on the issue of the subcontractor's attorney's fees under &sect; 48-2-14 (Repl.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff personal representative of the estate of the deceased appealed from a judgment of the court of appeals (New Mexico), which upheld the trial court's determination that granted summary judgment to defendant corporation, entered a default judgment against another defendant corporation, and found that plaintiff's recovery of damages was limited under the Dramshop Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-11-1 (1978) (Repl. Pamp. 1986).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The personal representative of the deceased challenged the grant of summary judgment to the owner of the dump truck, and attacked the cap on liability under the dramshop act as unconstitutional. The court concluded that the limitation of a full tort recovery implicated a substantial and important individual interest and invoked an intermediate standard of review. The court held that the three tacit classifications in the dramshop act effected a substantial injustice in the case. The classifications infringed on an individual's important interest to be compensated fully for his injuries, especially when they were a result of no fault of his own. The court found that the court of appeals erred in its equal protection analysis of the damage limitation. The court determined that plaintiff had presented a prima facie showing of an arbitrary and unreasonable denial of equal protection and of a restriction on a plaintiff's right of access to the courts. On the other hand, the bar owner completely failed to carry its burden of demonstrating that any substantial interest of the state was furthered by the legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cap on damages mandated by the Dramshop Act did not withstand heightened scrutiny, and the court held that it was constitutionally invalid as violative of the equal protection clause. The court did not disturb the summary judgment entered by the trial court in favor of the dump truck owner, but the case was remanded for entry of judgment in the amount of $ 250,000 against the bar.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtor filed an action against the creditor and the repossessor for the unlawful repossession of her vehicle. The appellate court affirmed a jury verdict for the creditor and the repossessor on the issue of liability. On appeal, the court reversed the appellate court's judgment and the jury verdict and remanded the case to the trial court for a determination of the debtor's actual damages. The court found that the jury instructions were insufficient because the trial court did not instruct the jury that the repossessor was not permitted to be assisted by law enforcement officials in a self-help repossession in order to prevent a breach of the peace. The court determined that the repossession of the debtor's vehicle was wrongful as a matter of law because a security police sergeant accompanied the repossessor. The court concluded that the introduction of law enforcement personnel into a self-help repossession transcended the permissible extrajudicial remedy under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55-9-503 (Repl. Pamp. 1987). The court further concluded that the mere presence of a law enforcement official during a self-help repossession was proscribed under the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendments.</SPAN></P>

The hospital sought a writ of prohibition or superintending control. The court issued a preliminary writ and asked for briefs on the constitutionality of &sect; 41-9-5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The real parties in interest brought medical malpractice actions against the hospital and a physician. In response to a motion to compel production of documents, the hospital argued that a credentialing file maintained on the physician was confidential under &sect; 41-9-5. Following in camera inspection, the judge ordered production of the requested documents either because the statute was not applicable to the credentialing file or because the rules of discovery or evidence overrode the statute. Finding that the record was insufficient to review ROIA's applicability to the credentials file, the state supreme court focused on whether &sect; 41-9-5 usurped the court's constitutional power to regulate all pleading, practice, and procedure affecting the judicial branch. While &sect; 41-9-5 encroached upon the court's power by withholding relevant and admissible evidence from discovery, it did not go so far as to create an evidentiary privilege in violation of the court's superintending control over all inferior courts under N.M. Const. art. VI, &sect; 3. However, the court undertook its constitutional responsibility to promulgate the requisite procedures for &sect; 41-9-5 to immunize evidence from discovery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case came upon certification from the United States District Court in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Plaintiffs alleged that defendant, the City of Gallup, violated a provision of New Mexico's municipal code, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-12-1.1 (Supp. 1987). The issue for review was whether the at-large election charter provisions of the City, a home rule municipality, were invalidated by &sect; 3-12-1.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City argued that its home rule charter was not affected by the New Mexico Legislature's enactment of &sect; 3-12-1.1. The City asserted that &sect; 3-12-1.1 was not a general law because it did not expressly deny the right of municipalities to establish the manner in which city councilors were elected, thus, it did not invalidate the City's at-large election charter. The court found that &sect; 3-12-1.1 applied to all municipalities with populations over 10,000. Therefore, &sect; 3-12-1.1, which required city councilors to reside in single-member districts, was a general law. As such, &sect; 3-12-1.1 limited home-rule if it also expressly denied municipalities the authority to legislate similar matters, as required by N.M. Const. art. X, &sect; 6(D). The court concluded that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-12-1.1 (Supp. 1987) sufficiently expressed the intent of the legislature to mandate that all municipalities with a population over 10,000 require their candidates for city council to reside in and be elected from single-member districts. Therefore &sect; 3-12-1.1 invalidated the City's home rule election charter that allowed at-large elections for city councilors.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the ultimate fact issue concerned whether the failure of the Department to exercise ordinary care was the proximate cause of the decedent's death. The court concluded that the ultimate fact issue had not been decided in the prior case, so the use of collateral estoppel was not appropriate. However, the court found that the State and the Department could be liable under the Tort Claims Act under traditional concepts of respondeat superior and that the lower court erred in concluding that certain statutory waivers of immunity were inapplicable as a matter of law to the acts or omission of the Secretary of Corrections regarding the decedent's death.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to various terms for three non-capital offenses and to death for murder with the sentences to run concurrently. The District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico) granted defendant's motion to set aside the death penalty and sentenced defendant to life imprisonment to run concurrently with the prior sentences. The State appealed from the denial of its motion for reconsideration of the concurrent life sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the State had no right to appeal because N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33-3-3(C) prohibited appeals when the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution or N.M. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2 prohibited further prosecution. The sentencing court determined that it had no authority to impose a sentence greater than the originally imposed sentence and thus could not exercise its discretion in the matter. The court held that the sentencing court properly declined to exercise its discretion to reconsider the sentence and properly denied the State's motion for reconsideration. N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39-3-3(C) precluded an appeal by the State when the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy prohibited further prosecution. Thus, the issue was not whether the State was an aggrieved party with a right to appeal under &sect; 39-3-3(B). Even if the State was an aggrieved party with a right to appeal, the sentencing court was prohibited from resentencing defendant so that his life estate ran consecutively with his other sentences. There was no statute that permitted the State to appeal from the sentence and thus defendant had an expectation of finality in his original sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of first-degree murder. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court found that defendant waived any impediment to a grand jury indictment because he failed to request a stay during the pendency of his appeal of a transfer order from children's court. The court concluded that defendant failed to present any evidence that televising portions of the proceedings prejudiced the presentation of his testimony and that he also failed to show that pre-trial media coverage of the case warranted a change of venue. The court also concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting the number of entries from defendant's diaries that could be read to the jury and explained by defendant. The court determined that a comment during the State's opening argument about raw test data that had not been furnished to defendant did not require a mistrial and that his motion for a mistrial on the issue of jury taint was untimely. The court found that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in limiting the testimony of a defense witness who was inadvertently present in the courtroom during the testimony of another defense witness.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had excluded the testimony of the employee's psychologist as to her mental instability on the basis that it was not considered expert medical testimony under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52-1-28(B) (1978).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the employee's workmen's compensation action. The trial court had found that her psychologist's testimony concerning her mental condition had to be excluded because it was not considered expert medical testimony under &sect; 52-1-28(B). The court of appeals affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that it was improper to exclude the testimony of the psychologist. The phrase &quot;expert medical testimony,&quot; as used in &sect; 52-1-28(B) described the kind of testimony that was required. It did not describe the witness's educational or licensing requirements. Therefore, the fact that psychologists were not licensed to practice medicine in New Mexico was an insufficient basis for the exclusion of their testimony under &sect; 52-1-28(B). Also, because &sect; 52-1-28(B) concerned an evidentiary matter, it should have been read in pari materia with N.M. R. Evid. 11-702 (1986), which indisputably recognized that an expert witness could be qualified on foundations other than licensure. Further, there was no legislative intent to limit the qualification of expert testimony to licensed physicians.</SPAN></P>

The employee sought compensation from the employer and defendant insurer. The insurer denied compensation for her injury on the ground that the accident occurred after she had left her duties of employment, thereby precluding her from recovery under the &quot;going-and-coming&quot; rule. The trial court ruled that the employee failed to establish that her injury was caused by the employer's negligence but awarded compensation by purporting to adopt the &quot;premises&quot; rule. The employee appealed, and the court affirmed holding that the employee, while on the employer's premises coming to or going from the actual workplace was in a place where the employee was reasonably expected to be, and that she was engaged in a necessary incident of employment. The court concluded that because it adopted the premises rule that allowed compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act, it was unnecessary to respond to the employee's appeal of the trial court's refusal to find the employer negligent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners appealed a judgment from the District Court of Eddy County (New Mexico) that, on remand and after consolidating the landowners' trespass action with defendant gas company's condemnation petition, determined that the use of the company's natural gas pipeline was a public use as required for condemnation under the Eminent Domain Code, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42A-1-22 (Repl. Pamp. 1981).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the prior action, the court instructed the trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the company's pipeline satisfied the court's case law criteria for establishing a real and substantial relation to the public use for condemnation purposes. The company showed that the pipeline was required by rules promulgated a state agency and that the state derived substantial tax revenues from the company's and other utilities' operations. On appeal, the court ruled that the trial court properly found that the company's pipeline bore a real and substantial relation to the public use as required by statute and the court's case law. The gas from the pipeline flowed into the stream of commerce and was essential to the efficient production of oil. The court also ruled that the pipeline was a gathering line and was exempt from regulations governing common carrier, under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 70-3-3 (Cum. Supp. 1985). Finally, the court ruled that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 70-3-5 (Cum. Supp. 1985) did not unconstitutionally create a private right of condemnation in a private entity when the entity showed its use was consistent with a public purpose. The company carried that burden.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the installation of gas lines was a physical improvement for real property and thus the statute concerning the liability of architects and contractors for injuries caused by negligent designs or constructions was applicable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested on criminal charges and detained prior to trial when they failed to make bail. The district court denied defendants' motions for good time credits on the grounds that it lacked statutory authority to grant them. The court of appeals held that the granting of good time credits for presentence confinement was constitutionally required. On further appeal, the court held that the granting of good time credits was an administrative matter for the Corrections Department or the county sheriff or jail administrator, and that N.M. R. Crim. P. 57.1 did not give the district court jurisdiction to entertain a motion for good time credits. The statutory scheme under which defendants were denied good time credits for the periods of their presentence confinement did not offend the constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process of law because there was a rational justification for declining to award good time credits for presentence confinement under the circumstances.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retailers were holders of valid and unexpired licenses authorizing them to sell and serve alcoholic beverages. They asked the trial court to declare void the local option elections held in local option districts and to enjoin the enforcement of any prohibition against the sales of alcoholic beverages by appellants on Sunday. The trial court denied relief and dismissed the action. Appellants sought review and argued that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-7A-1 (Cum. Supp. 1985) was unconstitutional because it violated their right to equal protection and furthered the establishment of religion. The court held that the statute did not violate equal protection because the legislature provided a rational basis for the prohibition of sales of alcoholic beverages on Sunday, namely, to protect the public health, safety, and morals of every community in the state. The court held that the law did not further religion. The court held that secular purposes had been advanced to make Sunday a day of rest and recreation.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did err in ruling that defendant's wife had waived the husband-wife privilege when she made a sworn statement to police shortly after the shooting. However, the court concluded that the admission of the wife's statement was harmless error because it could only have had an insignificant effect on the verdict, in light of the other evidence that was introduced, which showed defendant's awareness that a police officer was on the premises. The court rejected defendant's contentions of prosecutorial misconduct in the sentencing phase. The court found that the effect of the prosecutor's comments was insignificant when viewed in context. Moreover, the court noted that one of the proper lines of argument during the sentencing phase involved the consideration of the accepted justifications for the use of the death penalty. Those justifications were retribution and deterrence. The court also found that the jury instructions were proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought suit after defendant denied coverage for business interruption and property damage losses that occurred when a dam collapsed at plaintiff's uranium mill.

The court affirmed in part, and reversed in part The trial court did not err in finding that the differential settlement that caused the collapse was not subsidence, or an earth movement, defined as a naturally occurring phenomenon. While the court adopted a preponderance of the evidence standard of proof for punitive damages, the punitive damage and attorney fee awards were erroneous since defendant's refusal to pay was based on legitimate questions regarding the amount of damages that should be paid. The compensatory damages award was within the range of evidence, and the prejudgment interest fell within trial court's discretion.</SPAN></P>

The proceeding before appellee commission was initiated by appellant communications companies to determine whether cable television systems within the State of New Mexico were providing public utility telephone service, or anticipating providing such service, without the requisite authority from appellee. Appellee determined that appellants were offering public telephone services that fell within appellee's jurisdiction. In its decision and order, appellee ordered appellants to cease and desist until further order and required that any New Mexico cable television company apply for and be granted a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity before performing any construction for furnishing public telephone service and before furnishing any public telephone service to any customer. The issue presented on appeal was whether appellee had authority to regulate the cable companies' digital data transmission services.

After the property was sold, he delayed distributing the entirety of the balance of the proceeds to the owner. The Commission found that he had commingled funds and that he should have set up a trust account to handle the proceeds. In affirming the judgment, the court held that its scope of review was governed by N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 61-1-20 (1978, Repl. Pamp. 1981) of the Uniform Licensing Act, and that it could only reverse where administrative decisions were unconstitutional, were in excess of their authority or jurisdiction, were procedurally or legally defective, were unsupported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole, or were arbitrary and capricious. The court held that the Commission had jurisdiction, because the broker was acting as a real estate broker as defined in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 61-29-2(A). The court held that although he had obtained the owner's power of attorney, this did not alter his status as a broker in this transaction.

The initial charges were for second violations under &sect; 66-8-102, which authorized imprisonment for not less than 90 days nor more than 1 year. The State of New Mexico was later granted its motions to reduce the charges to first offense violations, which carried imprisonment terms of 30 through 90 days.

On appeal, the court reversed the denial of the writ and ordered that it be issued. The court first found that each individual faced a maximum possible aggregate penalty of 180 days or more. Therefore, N.M. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party intended to file a malpractice action against the two physicians and a clinic. The Superintendent of Insurance told the injured party, incorrectly, that only one of the physicians was &quot;qualified&quot; (having $ 100,000 in insurance coverage) pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-54 et seq. In reality, all defendants were &quot;qualified.&quot; The injured party filed a complaint with the medical review commission against the one &quot;qualified&quot; physician and filed suit against the other two parties. Although the complaint to the medical review commission was mailed prior to the running of the statute of limitations, it was not received until later. The &quot;qualified&quot; physician claimed that the complaint was filed too late and that suit was filed in violation of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-5-15A in not waiting for the commission's ruling before filing suit. The trial court agreed, and the appeals court affirmed. However, the court reversed, finding that the date of mailing of the complaint was the controlling date. While normally the injured party should have waited for the commission's ruling, he acted appropriately under the circumstances, given that he received incorrect information.</SPAN></P>

The district court found that the account was a duly verified open account within the meaning of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-7-1(1978).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court ruled that because the account was a duly verified open account and because the clients did not deny the account under oath in a writing filed as part of the pleadings prior to trial, the district court was obliged to direct a verdict. On review the court held that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-7-1 (1978) was unconstitutional and expressly overruled all prior cases to the contrary. That statute provided that accounts duly verified by the oath of the party claiming the same, and promissory notes and other instruments in writing, not barred by law, were sufficient evidence in any suit to enable a plaintiff to recover judgment for the account, unless the defendant denied the same under oath. The court noted that in light of more recent rules of civil procedure and of evidence, &sect; 38-7-1 no longer enjoyed constitutional validity. Rules of evidence were procedural, and the New Mexico Constitution reposed the inherent power to regulate all pleading, practice, and procedure that affected the judicial branch exclusively in the New Mexico Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In appellees' suit against appellants, the trial court held that 1979 N.M. Laws 319 &sect; 1, insofar as it attempted to amend N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-21-6 (1978), was unconstitutional as it violated N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16. Appellants sought the court's review. The court held that under art. IV, &sect; 16, the subject of every bill had to be clearly expressed in its title, and no bill embracing more than one subject could be passed except general appropriation bills and bills for the codification or revision of the laws. However, if any subject was embraced in any act which was not expressed in its title, only so much of the act as is not so expressed was void. Further, the cardinal test for interpreting art. IV, &sect; 16, was whether the title of the act in question gave reasonable notice of the subject matter of the body of the act. Here, the title to Ch. 319 referred to a specific act, the Community Development Act (the Act), N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 3-6-1- (1984), which was in no way related to &sect; 3-21-6. Further, nowhere did the title refer to &sect; 3-21-6. Accordingly, the title to Ch. 319, &sect; 1 violated art. IV, &sect; 16, and was unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled that the candidate resided in District 2 and was not eligible to hold the county commissioner position for District 3. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court ruled that the candidate failed to comply with the residency requirement. The court noted that candidate should have known about the residency requirement because the candidate was required to sign an affidavit of declaration of candidacy prior to being placed on the primary ballot stating that he was a resident of the commission district for which he declared his candidacy.

The court next held that a residency challenge was a proper election contest under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 1-14-1 and 1-14-3 (Repl. Pamp. 1984), noting that N.M. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from the dismissal of drunk driving charges against the claimant. The claimant petitioned for a writ of prohibition to direct the district court's dismissal of the state's appeal and to prohibit the district court from remanding the proceedings. The claimant contended that the state's appeal was untimely filed based on an order that the district court had no jurisdiction to enter. The court denied the claimant's request, concluding that the district court's order was the final order. The alleged prior order was merely an oral ruling that did not trigger the time for filing an appeal. Moreover, N.M. R. Crim. P. Metro. Ct. 71(b) unconstitutionally limited the state's right to appeal to two bases. That was inconsistent with the state constitution's grant of an unrestricted right to appeal final judgments. Thus, Rule 71(b) was retracted.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that company's use of the property owners' land was a public one under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 70-3-5 (Cum. Supp. 1983) and that their exclusive remedy was the statutory remedy of inverse condemnation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners brought a trespass action against the company after they discovered a pipeline on their land. The trial court stayed that action on the condition that the company initiate condemnation proceedings. A condemnation petition was filed. The trial court found that &sect; 70-3-5 made the company's use of the land, as a matter of law, a public use and that it had an immediate right to possess the right-of-way. It also found that statutory remedy of inverse condemnation was the property owners' exclusive remedy and dismissed their complaint. The property owners appealed from that judgment, which was reversed. The matter was remanded. A provision of the Eminent Domain Code, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42A-1-22 (Repl. Pamp. 1981), authorized immediate possession of the property by the condemnor provided that its use was a public one and immediate possession was necessary. While the declaration of public use contained in &sect; 70-3-5 was entitled to deference, that issue was reserved for the courts. Therefore, the trial court erred when it found that &sect; 70-3-5 was conclusive. Rather, a real and substantial relation to the public use had to be demonstrated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city and county officials enacted ordinances that established prohibitions against excessive air pollutant emissions from motor vehicles in the city and county. The ordinances delegated the power to regulate the operation of the vehicle emissions inspection and maintenance program to the board, and the board adopted regulations for the establishment of the program. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court's judgment for respondents in petitioners' declaratory judgment action. The court held that the imposition of an inspection fee was prohibited under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-6-25 and was not a valid exercise of local authorities' home rule power. Further, the repair provision was invalid as it was discriminatory in its application. However, the criminal penalty provisions of the program were not invalid, and the invalid provisions did not nullify the ordinances because of the severability clause. Thus, the program could be lawfully operated without the imposition of the inspection fee and without a repair cap for vehicles that were not in compliance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On cross appeal, the company argued that the district court erred in limiting damages for wrongful replevin to those set forth in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42-8-11 (1978). The court noted that two sections of the replevin statute provided remedies for situations in which a wrongful replevin had occurred, &sect; 42-8-11 and &sect; 42-8-19. The bank argued that these two sections were mutually exclusive; that once the company chose not to accept its offer to return the wrongfully replevied property its remedies were limited to those under &sect; 42-8-11. The court disagreed. Although the company was limited to the remedies found in the replevin statute, it was not limited to remedies found in only one section of that statute. The two sections addressed two separate wrongs. Section 42-8-19 addressed the specific failure of a plaintiff to prove the truth of the facts in his affidavit. Section 42-8-11, on the other hand, allowed a defendant to recover judgment in case a plaintiff failed to prosecute his suit with success and without unreasonable or unnecessary delay. The company could recover reasonable attorney fees incurred in the dissolution of the wrongfully issued writ of replevin under &sect; 42-8-19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court on the issue of relation back of the amended replevin affidavit, and remanded for determination of the company's damages for wrongful replevin.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to death for each count of first degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court's automatic exclusion for cause of potential jurors based on their views of capital punishment was error. The court held that as defendant did not contend that any particular juror was improperly disqualified, the argument was viewed as a general constitutional attack on the very process of death qualification. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that the trial court correctly followed constitutional and statutory requirements in conducting the death qualification of the jury. The court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the defense of insanity, holding that there was no basis in the evidence for an insanity instruction. The court affirmed the sentence holding that the death penalty in and of itself did not violate federal or state constitutional mandates against cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that the bifurcated trial to one jury did not offend constitutional principles as firsthand observation of the evidence provided the jury with the best information possible to make the weighty decisions involved in both guilt determination and sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, owners-operators and owners-lessors of liquor licenses, challenged the judgment of the District Court of Santa Fe County (New Mexico), which held that the Liquor Control Act (act) was not affected by the unconstitutionality of certain sections of the act and that &sect; 36 was constitutional. Appellees, alcohol beverage control and revenue department, challenged the judgment insofar as it held that &sect;&sect; 103 and 114 were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought a declaration that the act was unconstitutional. The trial court held that the act was constitutional except for &sect;&sect; 103 and 114. It also held that the entire act was not affected by the successful attack on &sect;&sect; 103 and 114 despite the governor's veto of a severability clause. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's finding that the governor's veto of the severability clause was constitutionally permissible. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed. Because the act did not appropriate money, the governor's veto power was invalidly exercised. Because liquor licensees had no property right in their license, &sect; 36 was constitutional. The act did not unreasonably deprive a licensee of all or substantially all of the beneficial use of his license. Thus, it did not effectuate a taking without due process. However, &sect; 103, which allowed summary temporary suspension of a license without prior notice or a hearing, violated procedural due process and was unconstitutional. Section 114 was unconstitutional because the reduction in gross receipts taxes was an unconstitutional subsidy to the liquor industry in violation of N.M. art. IX, &sect; 14.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town had an ordinance that regulated the size, design, placement, and maintenance of signs. The ordinance allowed two years for owners of signs to bring them into compliance or remove them.

The sign owners filed an action to enjoin the enforcement of the ordinance, and the trial court granted a writ of prohibition, finding that the ordinance violated the statute. The town appealed. On appeal the court affirmed. It held that (1) the town did not have the legal right to cause the removal of the signs until five years had passed, (2) the fact that the application of section 42A-1-34 drew upon facts arising before its enactment did not cause a retroactive application, (3) the statute did not violate N.M.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants filed an action seeking to obtain an injunction against the director to enjoin him from enforcing an amendment to the Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-12-2 (1978), which extended a price affirmation law to brewed products that had previously been excluded. The trial court granted a summary judgment in favor of the director. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found the amendment did not violate the notice requirements contained under N.M. Const. art. 4, &sect;&sect; 16 and 18 by allegedly concealing the effects the law where the title of the legislative bill did not fail to give reasonable notice of the subject matter of the amendment. The court held the Act on its face did not impose an undue burden on interstate commerce because the state was totally unconfined by traditional Commerce Clause limitations when it restricted the importation or intoxicants destined for use, distribution, or consumption within its borders. The court determined the Act did not violate antitrust laws where the Act dealt with regulation of alcoholic beverages, which could not be constitutionally condemned in the abstract. The court concluded the Act was a valid exercise of the state's police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court for the District of New Mexico certified a question, pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-2-8 (1978), regarding whether plaintiff workman was required to reimburse defendant employer for workmen's compensation benefits that he had received prior to a jury award that apportioned liability between the employer and defendants, manufacturers and a subcontractor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the workman was injured on the job, he filed a negligence action against the manufacturers of the machinery that caused his injury. His employer and the subcontractor were impleaded. When the jury apportioned liability among the defendants, and allocated 10 percent to the employer, the workman contented that any amount subrogated to the employer's insurer as reimbursement of workman's compensation benefits should be reduced by that percentage. The trial court certified the question, and the court entered an order the subrogation award for compensation and medical benefits should not have been reduced. The Workmen's Compensation Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 52-1-1 to 52-1-69 (1978), provided the exclusive remedy for claims by injured workmen against their employers. Because workmen were covered by the Act, irregardless any fault by an employer, the employer's liability for the injury could not be used to offset any subrogation obligation. Further, although the jury was able to apportion liability under the pure comparative negligence standard, this did not reduce the employer's absolute right to reimbursement under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52-1-56.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered an order that found the employer's insurer entitled to reimbursement for workmen's compensation benefits without apportionment as to fault.</SPAN></P>

Respondent moved to dismiss the subsequent indictment, alleging that he had been deprived of a meaningful opportunity to testify before the grand jury in violation of N.M. Stat.

The court noted that the municipality acquired an electric system by creating and incorporating the public service company as a municipally owned corporation and could do so under N.M. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In original proceedings, certiorari was granted in a parental termination case upon the application of petitioner State of New Mexico to review a court of appeals decision, which addressed the constitutionality of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-7-4(B)(4) (Supp. 1982). The court of appeals held that &sect; 40-7-4(B)(4) was void for vagueness and reversed a decision of the trial court terminating respondent mother's parental rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One judge dissented from the majority opinion of the court of appeals and outlined her reasons for finding &sect; 40-7-4(B)(4) neither vague nor indefinite. On certiorari, the court adopted the dissenting opinion as its opinion, thereby upholding the constitutionality of &sect; 40-7-4(B)(4). The majority of the appellate court was correct that the test to be applied when a claim of unconstitutional vagueness was whether persons of common intelligence had to guess at its meaning. But it was also an indispensable rule that the whole statute had to be brought under consideration. Section 40-7-4(B)(4) was only a part of a subsection of the statute entitled &quot;Termination of parental rights,&quot; which section, in turn, was only a part of the Adoption Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-7-1 to 40-7-11 and N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-7-13 to 40-7-17 (Supp. 1982). The dissenting judge concluded that she could not agree that from the great wealth of information and precedent available, and from a lifetime of familiarity with the English language, one had to guess at the meaning of any of the words used in &sect; 40-7-4(B)(4). The trial court's judgment should have been affirmed. By adoption of the opinion, the court agreed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The majority opinion of the court of appeals was reversed, and the dissent, which upheld the constitutionality of the challenged section of the parental rights termination statute, was adopted as the order of the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The partnership applied for a zoning change allowing a broader range of uses regarding construction site property. The request was granted, and an initial development plan was approved. The partnership applied for a new site development plan that increased the density of units. Years later, the district court approved the new site development plan. The project laid dormant for several years while financing was obtained. The partnership obtained a building permit for the first phase of the project. When construction began, neighbors brought a motion to intervene and a motion to set aside the district court decision. Both motions were granted, and the change in the site development plan was invalidated. The partnership later sued the city to recover damages it incurred when the city failed to issue additional building permits. The trial court entered summary judgment on behalf of the city on the grounds of sovereign immunity and the statute of limitations. The partnership appealed. The court affirmed because the city's decision to reduce the density of the proposed units was based on valid constitutional concerns. Also, the claim was barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

One month after the stabbing and two days before he died, the corrections officer stated that he understood his chances of recovery were nil. The court held that such statement demonstrated the corrections officer's belief that his death was imminent and, thus, that the trial court's admission of the corrections officer's statement as a dying declaration was not an abuse of discretion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The human services department filed a petition seeking to terminate the mother's parental rights. The trial court granted the petition. The mother appealed, arguing that &sect; 40-7-4 was unconstitutional because it was vague. The court agreed and reversed the judgment. The court held that to withstand a vagueness challenge a statute must state its standard with adequate clarity and establish sufficient boundaries for the law to be fairly administered. The court found that the terms parent and disintegrated were not sufficiently defined within the statute. The evil that had to be avoided was conduct on the part of a parent that would deny the child the care, guidance, or control necessary for his physical, emotional, and medical needs. Parent child disintegration did not have a precise meaning: it lacked metes and bounds. The language did not inform parents of what they needed to do to avoid termination of their parental rights.</SPAN></P>

The court was of the opinion that the statute meant that the particular agency that caused the alleged harm must have had actual notice before written notice was required.

In the removal proceedings, the utility raised constitutional objections to the SCC's use of the double leverage method, its determination of cash working quality, and its use of service quality issues to penalize the utility. Weighing the evidence pursuant to N.M. Const. art. XI, &sect; 7, the court adopted certain of the SCC's findings as its own, but it remanded the SCC's order for further proceedings. The court held that the SCC lawfully and reasonably used the double leverage method to determine a fair rate of return, and the use of the method did not deprive the utility of due process or equal protection of the law. It was arbitrary and capricious, however, for the SCC to depart from its past practice in determining the utility's cash working capital without sufficient prior notice or reasonable justification as reflected in the record. The SCC was without authority to penalize the utility for service quality issues after it had arrived at a fair and reasonable rate of return.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This suit arose out of a complex billion-dollar dispute between appellee nuclear corporation and appellant atomic company. In this action, the atomic company challenged the decision of the District Court of Santa Fe County (New Mexico) which declared void a California arbitration award in its favor and affirmed prior judgments in favor of the nuclear corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues on appeal were: (1) whether prior United States Supreme Court (Supreme Court) decisions prohibited the trial court from voiding the arbitration award and affirming the prior judgments; (2) whether the trial court had jurisdiction to void the arbitration award under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1-14 (Arbitration Act); (3) whether the Arbitration Act prevented the trial court from voiding the award; (4) and whether the nuclear corporation's claim for supplemental relief was cognizable under the New Mexico Declaratory Judgment Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 44-6-1 to 15 (1978). The nuclear corporation claimed that the trial court's decision conformed to the Supreme Court mandates, that the arbitration award was void under the doctrine of res judicata, and that there was no agreement to arbitrate. After review, this court concluded that the trial court had jurisdiction. Further, it agreed with the trial court and held that antitrust issues were not arbitrable, and the arbitrators did not have jurisdiction to issue an award. They acted in manifest disregard of the law and in excess of their powers in failing to give full faith and credit to the prior decisions.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals (New Mexico) reversed, ignoring the constitutionality argument. The State brought a further appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conditions required by N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-7-4, (Supp.1981) were all found to exist by the trial court. The opinion of the court of appeals ignored the arguments presented in the briefs and held that the trial court's termination order was improper because the child was not placed in foster care by court order. On further appeal, the court determined that such a construction of the statute was more restrictive than provided by &sect; 40-7-4. No explanation was given for failing to consider that portion of the statute, which recognized that placement may be made without a court order. The court did not know whether the appellate court merely overlooked the additional language of the statute or whether the additional words were deleted in an effort to see a result in the case more acceptable to the reviewer. Under either circumstance, the court of appeals erred in reversing on that ground. The case was remanded because the court had not been asked to consider the constitutional arguments that were raised and affirmance of the trial court's decision by the court would leave the mother's claims unheard.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the lower court abused its discretion. The court held that the bondsman had no right to receive personal notice of defendant's trial date under the due process clause because the procedures were adequate to protect his rights where he was not obligated to produce defendant for trial, but was merely obligated to pay the penalty for his failure to appear. The court concluded that the lower court abused it discretion in forfeiting the entire amount of bail because it was unjust to do so when the bondsman's efforts were thwarted by the actions of another sovereign.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the appellate court's finding that the child abuse statute was constitutional but reversed with respect to its finding on the duress issue and reinstated defendant's conviction. The court held that &sect; 30-6-1(C) was a strict liability statute, thus, it did not require an intent, duress was not a defense to the crime, and the psychologist's testimony was properly excluded.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the order of the district court, holding that the sign ordinance was constitutionally valid on its face, because it was reasonably related to traffic safety, and zoning solely for aesthetic purposes was not an invalid exercise of the city's police power.

Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-4-1 to 41-4-29 (1978) (Orig. Pamph. &amp; Cum.

The federal district court certified the question of whether the Act prohibited the inmate from burning the action under the Act when he also brought an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 42. The court held that the Act did not prohibit the inmate from bringing an action for damages under the Act when he also pursued, by reason of the same occurrence, an action against the same government under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court cited the Supremacy Clause, which barred a legislature from enacting a law that would have had the effect of depriving the inmate of his rights secured by the United States Constitution, and presumed that the legislature enacted the statute within the bounds of the Constitution. The court then construed the Act's language narrowly to mean that a tort was separate and distinct from a constitutional deprivation, which could have been remedied in a jurisdiction other than New Mexico, and that the legislature did not intend to condition it waiver of immunity on the inmate's forbearance of his federal rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of trafficking in heroin for the second time. The trial court refused to sentence defendant to life imprisonment as called for in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54-11-20(B)(2) (1975) of the Controlled Substance Act, and sentenced defendant as a first offender on the basis that &sect; 54-11-20(B)(2) imposed cruel and unusual punishment. The Court of Appeals (New Mexico) reversed the decision of the trial court. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the sentencing hearing, the trial judge commented that defendant's latest conviction was based on evidence that the quantity of heroin was very small and was only one-tenth of one-percent in purity. He announced that he would not order a life sentence under such circumstances. The Court of Appeals held that the Controlled Substance Act was constitutionally sound and that a life sentence need not be imposed because the court had the authority to suspend or defer the sentence. On further appeal, the court noted that the crime was not designated as a first, second, third, or fourth degree felony but was designated only as &quot;a felony.&quot; The penalty provisions for the offense were included in &sect; 54-11-20B(2), which defined the crime. Under &sect; 54-11-20B(2) and N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-29-11(A) (1953), the punishment could be either a fine or a life sentence. The legislature did not establish the crime as a first-degree felony and did not make a life sentence mandatory. Defendant was not convicted of a capital crime or first-degree felony, so the trial court had the authority to defer or suspend the sentence under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-20-3 (1981). A remand for resentencing was necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the Court of Appeals was affirmed. The cause was remanded to the trial court for resentencing of defendant.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the protestants argued that &sect;&sect; 3-21-15 through 3-21-26 were unconstitutional and that the petition in support of the district lacked sufficient signatures of registered electors as required by N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-21-18(B). In reversing, the court found that the testimony of a former precinct worker was sufficient to deduct certain voters from the number of electors in the district but that there was an issue as to whether an increased number of voters appearing in an updated registration list after the petition was filed were electors in the district at the time of filing. The court held that, because the burden was on the officials to establish their authority, and because the record was inconclusive on the number of district electors, there was a failure of proof on the issue of whether the requisite number of signatures appeared on the petition submitted pursuant to &sect; 3-21-18(B). The court declined to address the constitutional issue because the decision did not require it.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the Albuquerque, N.M., Adult Entertainment Facilities Ordinance, No. 26-1977 (1977) was passed, which regulated adult theaters as special uses. The trial court found that the theater was a nonconforming structure because it showed adult movies, however, it was permitted to continue operation because the nonconforming use existed before the amendment. The trial court concluded that the theater abandoned its non-conforming use status when it stopped showing adult movies and thus its later operation as an adult theater violated the ordinance as a special use permit was not obtained. The theater appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that the 500-foot distance restriction in Albuquerque, N.M., Comprehensive City Zoning Code &sect; 30(B)(10)(d)(1) was not unconstitutionally vague where the city's method of measurement was reasonable and applied consistently. The theater abandoned its non-conforming use status when it did not use the theater to show adult movies for a continuous period of one year or more, as provided in Albuquerque, N.M., Comprehensive City Zoning Code &sect; 40(D)(1)(i).</SPAN></P>

The property owners alleged that the zoning restriction was ultra vires, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 3-21-1, 3-21-8 (1978). The city raised the statute of limitations, N.M. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners initiated an action against the city, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from a restriction imposed in a special exception by the city's board of adjustment. The special exception granted the right to operate a tennis club, but required that the right end with any change in ownership. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the city and the property owners appealed, asserting that the restriction was unconstitutional and void because it was ultra vires. The court held that the statute of limitations, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-21-9, did not bar the action because the property owners could collaterally attack the restriction as beyond the scope of the city's statutory authority. It found no basis for either defense of unclean hands or laches. On the merits, the court found that it was not within the proper function of the zoning authority, as provided in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 3-21-1, 3-21-8, to condition an exception to the use of real property upon personal rights of ownership rather than use. Although there was no express restriction, the effect of the condition stated in the exception and variance was to do just that, and thus, it was unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

On appeal, the court held that the trial court's order for modification of the petition was based upon substantial evidence and not subject to reversal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of commercial burglary and sentenced to one to five years in the penitentiary. After he had begun serving this sentence, the State filed a supplemental information charging defendant as an habitual offender, based on four prior felony convictions, and defendant was convicted. The District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico) vacated the sentence on the principal offense and imposed a life sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In regard to the double jeopardy issue raised by defendant, the court cited its own prior decision in an unrelated case, and the addition support of a recent United States Supreme Court decision, in its determination that the habitual offender proceeding was merely a sentencing procedure and, hence, did not involve double jeopardy. On the second issue, the court held that the life sentence that was imposed did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The court relied on another United States Supreme Court case in pointing out that the length of the sentence actually imposed was purely a matter of legislative prerogative. Absent a compelling reason, which was not found to be present in the case, the court recognized that the judiciary should not impose its own views concerning the appropriate punishment for crimes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, which sold general merchandise throughout the United States, claimed that the inclusion in gross income of $ 25 million for foreign income taxes paid by its foreign subsidiaries and reported as dividend income on its federal income tax return in order to claim a credit under I.R.C. &sect;&sect; 78, 901-908, was inequitable; that cash stock dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries were not business income under the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act, &sect; 7-4-1 to -21 (1978); that the department's allocation violated the taxpayer's due process rights; and that the department should have modified the apportionment formula. The court reversed the court of appeals' judgment because: (1) the state's piggy-back method for determining taxable income by reference to federal law, N.M. Stat.

</DIV>

The court held that the prohibition against nude dancing in a licensed liquor establishment by the statute did not violate the free speech provision of N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 17. The broad powers of the states to regulate the sale of liquor, conferred by U.S. Const. amend. XXI, outweighed any U.S. Const. amend. I interest in nude dancing, and a state could therefore ban such dancing as a part of its liquor license program. The court stated that the statute was severable with regard to its prohibition against indecent dancing in a &quot;public place,&quot; because the portion relating to indecent dancing in a licensed liquor establishment was enforceable only by the Director of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control through suspension or revocation of the liquor license. The portion prohibiting indecent dancing in any &quot;public place&quot; was enforceable by other law enforcement officials through arrest and prosecution for a misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>

In affirming defendant's convictions, the court first held that &sect; 30-9-11 was not unconstitutionally vague for failing to define &quot;penetration&quot; or describe what was unlawful penetration. The court held that no person of ordinary intelligence would not understand which type of conduct was proscribed. The court next held that the wife's consent to search was all that was needed to search the house and that her motivation in consenting was irrelevant. The court then found no error in the prosecutor's reference to pictures other than those admitted at trial, or in the prosecutor's reference to guns found in the home.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that to allow the Board of Pharmacy to schedule drugs, resulting in the attachment of differing criminal penalties for the possession of scheduled drugs, was an unconstitutional delegation of authority under the N.M. Const. art. III, &sect; 1. The court disagreed. The legislature could lawfully delegate authority to an administrative agency when that authority was restricted by specific legislative standards. N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-31-3 did not violate the delegation strictures of the New Mexico Constitution. The legislature established strict guidelines for the Board of Pharmacy to follow in determining a substance's potential for abuse. The standards for the scheduling of dangerous drugs were clear and the duties of the Board were definite. The legislative scheme for designating and scheduling potentially abused drugs allowed the Board of Pharmacy only minimal discretion in its fact-finding function and no discretion in enacting substantive law. The Board's expertise in this field was crucial and its vigilance in dealing with new and dangerous drugs was necessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a county and its officials, and appellee taxpayer challenged an order of the District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico), which held in the taxpayer's action for a property tax refund or for damages for excess taxes and a reduced valuation that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-36-17 (1978) was unconstitutional and ordered the county to adequately fund the property reappraisal program under which the taxpayer's realty was reappraised.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants alleged that the legislative repeal of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-36-17 (1978) rendered the declaration that that statute was unconstitutional moot and the taxpayer argued that her remedy was improper. The court affirmed the district court's judgment, concluding that the legislative action rendered appellants' argument moot and that the taxpayer was not entitled to any damages because the taxes that she paid did not exceed the limit for which the law allowed. The court reasoned that having the county raise the value of the property that the taxpayer claimed was too low to the same level as the amount that she was paying was a valid remedy due to the compliance with N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-36-15 (1978) as to the reappraisal of the taxpayer's realty at its fair market value and because the assessment was not for more than the law provided. The court also noted that the taxpayer did not claim any fraud nor intentional discrimination as to the manner in which the reassessment program was conducted or the decision to discontinue it due to a lack of resources and that the record did not indicate any well-defined and established scheme of discrimination or fraudulent action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children's father was killed in an accident while employed by defendant employer. The trial court dismissed the complaint because N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52-1-52 prohibited compensation for dependents who were not residents of the United States. The court affirmed the judgment, rejecting plaintiffs' contention that &sect; 52-1-52 violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The court found no law stating that workmen's compensation was ranked as a fundamental right within the constitutional framework. The court also found that the New Mexico legislature conferred no due process property right upon plaintiffs that the trial court could have violated by dismissing plaintiffs' suit. Additionally, the court concluded that plaintiffs, as residents of the Republic of Mexico, were beyond the protective reach of the equal protection clause and outside of the court's ability to help their cause on constitutional grounds. Therefore, the court determined that plaintiffs' non-resident alien status prevented them from recovering death benefits under the Act.</SPAN></P>

The questions on review were whether N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 29-9-8(B)(1978) was constitutional and which court would have jurisdiction to entertain the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were asked to submit briefs on the constitutionality of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 29-9-8(B)(1978) in light of the provisions of N.M. Const. art. VII, &sect;&sect; 2 and 3. The parties were also asked what court, if any, had jurisdiction to rule on the motion for issuance of a subpoena duces tecum to the Commission if the statute was constitutional. On review, the court determined that the last sentence in &sect; 29-9-8(B) was severable but that the remainder of the Organized Crime Act (Act) remained in full force and effect. The court found that under the court's power of superintending control, and in this particular case, the district courts were authorized and directed, upon proper application for a subpoena duces tecum under N.M. Stat. Ann. R. Civ. P. 45 (1978), to hear and determine whether the records, reports and files of the Commission could be subpoenaed. If the district court ordered that a subpoena duces tecum be issued, the district court was directed to hold an in camera hearing to determine which records, reports and files of the Commission should be produced.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed in part because the commission, through its general statements, reasonably complied with and fulfilled its obligation to give reasons upon which it based its adoption of the regulations. The court reversed in part and remanded on the issue of the overbroad definition of &quot;toxic pollutant&quot; in the commission's regulations, holding that it was unconstitutionally vague and voided two sections of the new regulations. The court also reversed the determination of the lower court that the standards adopted by the commission were not rules because if they were not, they would have no efficacy, validity, or enforceability.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Act did not regulate the advertising on the basis of its content nor did it completely prevent the dissemination of the same information by alternative means. The Act restricted commercial, rather than political or ideological, speech. Thus, the Act met the three-pronged test used to determine whether a time, place, and manner restriction was valid. The Act's restrictions on advertisers' exercise of their freedom of speech was justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech. None of the Act's stated purposes, promotion of public safety, health, welfare, convenience and enjoyment of public travel, protection of public investment in public highways, and preservation and enhancement of the scenic beauty of lands bordering the public highways, were related to a particular message of such signs.

After judgment in favor of the assessor and remand, the protests were denied. On further appeal, the court reversed, holding that the appeal was not barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Because the taxpayers' properties were reappraised every year, while over 90 percent of the land in the county had not been subjected to even a single reappraisal, the court concluded that the reappraisal was done in a systematically discriminatory manner. The taxpayers were singled out for selective enforcement of tax laws. Because of the absence of any systematic and definite plan for reappraisal of all lands, the assessment violated N.M. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1 and N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 18.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought an action against defendants seeking to invalidate an annexation of contiguous land. The district court entered judgment on a stipulated record in favor of the village. The court affirmed, holding that res judicata did not apply because the subject matter of the prior and current suits was not simply the land involved, but the two different attempts to annex the same land. The court held that the judge's holding in the first case that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14-7-17 (1953) was unconstitutional, was a conclusion purely of law, and was not collaterally binding on the judge in a second case between the same parties or privies. The court held that the village was not collaterally estopped to assert that &sect; 14-7-17 was constitutional in the second suit. Because &sect; 14-7-17 did not involve elections and did not infringe upon the fundamental right to vote, the court applied minimum scrutiny and held that discrimination or inequality would not be set aside if any state of facts were reasonably conceived to justify it. The court found that apportionment of taxes was a rational basis for the annexation and that &sect; 14-7-17 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital's dispute with the board revolved around the board's alleged failure to pay indigent claims as required by the Act. The trial court determined that the portion of the Act that provided for counties to pay hospital claims for &quot;indigent patients&quot; as defined by the Act violated N.M. Const. art. IX, &sect; 14 and that the definition of &quot;indigent patient&quot; was vague and overbroad. Reversing the trial court's judgment, the court found that contemporaneous construction of &sect; 14 was proper because the term &quot;poor&quot; in 1912 may have meant penniless, but in 1978 had to include persons on welfare who barely eked out an existence. Thus, the court held that the legislature's definition of &quot;indigent patient&quot; in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-2-15(B) was not unconstitutional under N.M. Const. art. IX, &sect; 14, nor was it vague or overbroad.</SPAN></P>

The Director filed a motion to quash the subpoena, which was denied. The Director appealed and contended that U.S. Const. amends.

The court affirmed the judgment and held that the Commission was an investigatory rather than an accusatory body and that its subpoenas were administrative and not subject to search and seizure protections of the Fourth Amendment. The trial court properly determined that the subpoena was sufficiently limited in scope and that the material sought was relevant. The court rejected the Director's argument that the Act was unconstitutionally vague. The Act was not penal and not amenable to a claim of vagueness. The court also held that the Act did not violate N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16, because the word &quot;racketeering&quot; was not required to appear in the title.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner sought recovery of unpaid rent, and the resident sought damages and abatement. The trial court found that the landowner had actual notice of the deficiencies claimed, absent any evidence of written notice.

The landowner requested a finding of fact that the resident did not serve any written notice as required by &sect; 70-7-29, and the trial court did not make such findings. On appeal the court held that the trial court erred by not making such a finding and reversed the judgment. Because N.M. Stat.

The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment and she took an interlocutory appeal. The Court of Appeals reversed. The court, on its own motion issued a writ of certiorari under authority of N.M. Const. art. 6, &sect; 3. The court found that the appellate court erroneously determined that the definition section of the Children's Code, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;13-14-3, and N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-6-3 had to be construed together. The court of appeals noted that the juvenile did not commit a delinquent act. The court held that &sect; 13-14-3 applied only to children less than 18 years of age and was intended to protect children from the consequences of their own acts, so longs as it was consistent with protection of the public interest. It established a system of treatment for children who have committed delinquent acts or were neglected. Conversely, N.M. Stat.

The court held that the threshold question was whether mandamus was the proper remedy and whether the court was the proper place in which to bring the action. The court held that the petition was properly styled mandamus, and the requested relief was within the scope of the mandamus remedy. The court held that the engineer was being deprived of the duties, responsibilities, and authority he was given by law when he was properly appointed to his position. Thus, the court found it apparent that no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy, other than mandamus, existed whereby his rights could be protected.

On review, the court denied petitioner's application for a writ of prohibition against the judge. The court found that the ultimate effect of &sect; 21-5-8 was that different rights accrued to the class of litigants in district courts, depending upon where cases were filed, without regard to changing conditions that might develop in the future. The court thus held that &sect; 21-5-8 was a special law, which was prohibited under N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 24. The court ruled that petitioner had not shown that a general law could not have been enacted which gave ever member of the class the same status as litigants in the second district. The court applied its holding only to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-5-8(B), which it found to be severable.</SPAN></P>

The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sign company had contended that if their signs were not compensable under the act, then the act was unconstitutional as applied to them. The trial court found that the signs erected by the company could have only been compensable if they fell within one of the exceptions provided for in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55-11-4 and that its signs failed to conform to any of those exceptions. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in a memorandum opinion filed earlier. When both parties petitioned for rehearing, the court substituted this opinion for the memorandum opinion. The court affirmed. The court found that the act was constitutional (1) because property was subject to the fair exercise of the state's police power; and (2) reasonable regulations, enacted for the benefit of the public health, safety, or general welfare, were not unconstitutional. The court further found that the state was not equitably estopped from denying compensation to the company for the removal of its signs because the evidence showed that the company recognized language on certain permits stating that the permits could be revoked at any time and the signs removed at the owners' expense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants claimed title to the lands based on the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo and certain hijuelas stemming from the treaty. Defendants contended that the injunction was void for being vague and overbroad and that there was no substantial evidence to support the trial court's finding that defendants were in contempt of court for violating the injunction. The court affirmed the decision, finding that defendants were not found in contempt of court for asserting protected rights. Instead, defendants were found to have completely disregarded a court order that prohibited them from interfering with plaintiffs' quiet enjoyment. The court determined that the injunction set forth the proscribed acts in language that was neither vague nor uncertain. It was capable of being read and understood by persons of common intelligence. Finally, the court found that the trial court's findings in support of its contempt order were supported by substantial evidence because the evidence relied upon by the trial court in making its findings was relevant, probative, and sufficient to satisfy a reasonable mind of its truth. Thus, the conclusions reached were reasonable and not based on conjecture.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a city, a housing authority, and a manufacturer, sought certiorari review of a decision entered in the Court of Appeals (New Mexico), which reversed a district court judgment in respondents' personal injury action and found that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23-1-23 was unconstitutional on equal protection grounds. Respondents included an injured minor and those suing on her behalf.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor was allegedly injured on a merry-go-round owned by the city's housing authority. The suit to recover for her injuries was brought nearly three years later. The city and housing authority asserted the affirmative defense of statute of limitations. The district court dismissed the case, and the minor appealed, challenging the constitutionality of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23-1-23. The minor asserted that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23-1-23 and its one-year statute of limitation denied the victims of municipal torts equal protection because it was inconsistent with N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23-1-8, which had a three-year limitation period against private tortfeasors. The court of appeals reversed and found that the statute was unconstitutional. On review, the court stressed that, if the one-time limitations for filing in the statute were applicable, the proceedings were properly terminated. The court held that there was a rational basis for limiting the time period in which suit could be brought against the city because the it narrowed exposure for determining insurance rates, the city was limited in its ability to raise taxes and funds, and the city had a greater need to know what claims it faced.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-2-13 (1953). By her will, the testator bequeathed and devised all of her estate to appellee, a stranger, who was not an heir.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The heir, who was the daughter of the brother of the testator's deceased husband, sought to contest the testator's last will and testament. The will bequeathed the testator's entire estate to the stranger. The district court granted judgment in the stranger's favor. The court affirmed, but the U.S. Supreme Court remanded the case to the court for further consideration. Thereafter, the court reversed and remanded. The heir claimed that she was an interested person who had a right to challenge the will under &sect; 30-2-13. She further claimed that under a literal reading of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 29-1-13, 29-1-14 and 29-1-15, heirs of a predeceased husband were discriminated against on the basis of gender. The court found that there was no constitutional violation. The court held that although the language of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 29-1-13 was phrased exclusively in terms of the male intestate, the case law indicated that the statute applied equally to a spouse of either sex who died intestate and without issue. Thus, the heirs of a predeceased male spouse were not excluded from the unified scheme. The heir had the right to challenge the will.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first case, the applicant claimed to own in fee simple and have actual possession of certain lands, and sought a quitclaim deed from the city, which filed a motion to dismiss challenging the trial court's jurisdiction, the applicant's standing, the claim's sufficiency, and lack of an indispensable party. The trial court entered an order dismissing the complaint with prejudice unless the applicant, within 20 days, amended and sought mandamus or quiet title. Although both cases involved some or all of the same land, the applicant was plaintiff in the first case and defendant in the second and the dismissal was with prejudice, such factors did not meet the test to apply res judicata or collateral estoppel by judgment. The court held that the applicant's chance to amend his pleadings did not make the causes of action identical. The court pointed out that the rule that a prior final decision determined not only what was in issue but also what might have been in issue contemplated existing identical causes of action and not what the causes of action might have been after theoretical amendments to the pleadings which were never made. The judgment was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the state commission did not have a constitutional duty to provide the revue based on its prior order and was not required by N.M.

The third-party complaint was based on the theory that the New Mexico guest statute was no longer applicable because it had been declared unconstitutional by the New Mexico Supreme Court. The trial court held that the guest statute did apply and dismissed the third-party complaint. Upon review, the court reversed. The Supreme Court had declared its decision was given a modified prospectivity. The court found that the decision applied to all civil actions in which the complaint was filed after the Supreme Court's decision. The individual filed his action after the decision was handed down. Thus, the guest statute was not applicable.

Appellant owner of the aircraft claimed due process violations and the finance company and the alleged secured creditor claimed security interests in the plane. The State seized the plane and sought a foreclosure and a declaration that the State was entitled to the plane free and clear of the interest of any party. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment as to the owner of the aircraft and the alleged secured creditor, but reversed as to the finance company. The claimed constitutional errors of appellant owner were without merit. The statute provided for a hearing within 30 days of the seizure, which was sufficient to satisfy due process standards. There was also substantial evidence to support the trial court's finding of probable cause for the search and seizure. However, the finance company admitted in its answer and introduced documentary and testamentary evidence of its security interest. The court held that the forfeiture of a vehicle under the Act was subject to the security interests of an innocent third party; therefore, the trial court erred in not recognizing the finance company's security interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an itinerant farm worker, shot his wife. The court affirmed the guilty verdict but reversed the death sentence, holding that because of recent United States Supreme Court decisions, the penalty to be imposed was life imprisonment. No jury determination of defendant's competency was required because the trial court correctly found that he was competent. Defendant's motion to suppress certain statements was properly denied because Miranda warnings were properly given. Admission of photographs of the deceased was not an abuse of discretion. Defendant's counsel was not prevented from using the word &quot;malice&quot; in his closing argument. The Uniform Jury Instructions-Criminal were properly used even though the information was filed before the date on which their use became mandatory. Defendant's objection to a combined instruction on intoxication and diminished responsibility was not preserved. N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-2-1 (1972) was not unconstitutional because the distinction between first and second degree murder was clearly drawn.

The court held that: (1) the penalty to be imposed for a first degree felony was life imprisonment; (2) before the defendant could be convicted of felony murder, he was entitled to be given notice of the precise felony with which he was being charged; (3) a jury instruction was incomplete and constituted error where it permitted jury to find guilt of first degree murder based upon implied malice; but (4) the defendant's admissions were admissible where his statements were taken two days after his arrest after being warned of his rights.</SPAN></P>

The court found that mandatory death sentences that left neither the trial court nor jury with the discretion to impose lesser sentences violated the U.S. Const. amend. VIII prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The court determined that the legislature's enactment of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-29-2 (Supp. 1975) was an impermissible response to the capriciousness that previously existed in the imposition of the death penalty. The court held that the former statutes were revived because their revival would not run contrary to the legislature's intent to punish the crimes for which appellants were convicted. The court noted that the revived &sect; 40-29-2 left the recommendation of life imprisonment or death to the unbridled discretion of the jury.

The individuals sought to have the appeal dismissed on the ground that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20-1-12.1(C) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individuals sought recovery for alleged slanderous radio broadcasts, news reports, or newscasts. The privilege claimed by the broadcasters under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20-1-12.1(A) directly conflicted with N.M. R. Evid. 501 and the review procedures provided by N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20-1-12.1(C), pursuant to which the broadcasters' appeal was taken, were inconsistent with the rules for appellate procedure. Dismissing the appeal, the court held that the privilege against disclosure created by the legislature in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20-1-12.1(A) was not available in a judicial proceeding. The court reasoned that a privilege was a rule of evidence and that the legislature lacked power to prescribe by statute rules of evidence and procedure as such power was constitutionally vested exclusively in the court. The court also found that the review provided for in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20-1-12.1(C) was unconstitutional because the legislature had no power to substitute a de novo hearing for an appeal from a judgment or order of the district court, and had no power to fix the time within which an appeal was heard by the court.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court found that the evidence, including the concealment of the body and defendant's flight after the crime, justified an instruction under N.M. Stat.

However, there was no evidence that showed defendant raped the victim, there was no evidence that defendant committed an act that was dangerous to more than one person, and there was no evidence that defendant intended to kill anyone other than the victim. Thus, there was not sufficient evidence to justify the jury instructions on the remaining theories of murder.

VI, &sect; 3, petitioner district attorney successfully sought alternative writs of prohibition to preclude respondent from proceeding in the criminal cases.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consolidated cases raised the question whether the New Mexico death penalty statute,&nbsp;&sect;40A-29-2, was unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States or under N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 18. In the underlying criminal actions, respondent held by memorandum opinion that &sect; 40A-29-2 was unconstitutional under a United States Supreme Court case, that the law prior to 1973 would apply, and that, therefore, the maximum penalty if defendants in the criminal cases were convicted of first degree murder would be life imprisonment. Petitioner alleged there was a conflict in the New Mexico judicial districts as to whether or not the death penalty as written by the legislature in 1973 was constitutional, that several persons in other judicial districts have been convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death, and that allowing the ruling of respondent to stand would result in the rendering of unequal justice. The court held that the statute did not violate either the Eighth Amendment or N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 18. The procedures imposing the death penalty provided by N.M. Stat.
