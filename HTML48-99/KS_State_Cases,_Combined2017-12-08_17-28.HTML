</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner appealed the trial court's grant of a permanent injunction against construction of a 40-foot by 60-foot detached garage on her property. She had previously obtained permission from the Board of Zoning Appeals to erect the structure. The trial court found that construction of the garage was in violation of Geary County Zoning Regulations. On appeal, the owner argued that the county and the Board of Zoning Appeals were contingently necessary parties because the residents claimed that the county officials had acted unlawfully and misinterpreted their own zoning regulations when they issued the permit. The court held that the fact that certain county officials believed that their initial action in issuing the building permit was justified under the zoning regulations did not govern future cases. The inclusion of the phrase &quot;proper county officials,&quot; as one of the two parties authorized to bring suit in the zoning regulations, made clear that the county was not required to be a party defendant when a violation of a zoning regulation was pleaded. The court held that the county and the Board were not contingently necessary parties pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-219.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant resident sought review of a decision from the Johnson District Court (Kansas), which found him guilty of violating Overland Park Municipal Code 7.26.180 (1989) as it related to trash, refuse, and waste. The resident argued that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss because the city ordinance was vague and ambiguous and the service and the complaint and notice to appear was not made by a police officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Overland Park Municipal Code 7.26.180 prohibited the accumulation of waste, debris, or refuse. The court held that a person of common intelligence could ascertain that waste included tree limbs, such that the ordinance conveyed a sufficient definite warning when measured by common understanding and was therefore not impermissibly vague. The district court did not err in denying the resident's motion to dismiss. Overland Park Municipal Code 7.26.240 provided that notices of hearing or orders issued by a public officer were to be served upon persons either personally or by registered or certified mail. Public officer meant the environmental health officer or the officer's designated representative, Overland Park Municipal Code 7.26.025(h). The resident's argument that by enacting this provision, the city was in violation of the code of procedure for municipal courts, specifically Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-4203, which required service of a complaint and notice to appear by a law enforcement officer, was without merit because the city had authority under its home rule powers to enact provisions allowing the environmental health officer to serve orders and notices of hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged and convicted of rape. He appealed. On review, he conceded that the jury could have found that the victim was overcome by force; however, he disputed that the victim was incapable of giving consent. Both theories must have been valid due to the jury's general verdict on the alternative theories. The court found that in light of the victim's epilepsy, suicide attempt, and diminished I.Q., the jury could have found that the victim was incapable of consenting. The court further rejected defendant's contention that it was error to limit his cross-examination of the victim regarding a prior incident of sexual intercourse that conflicted with her testimony at preliminary hearing. That is, a medical record from years before indicated that she had engaged in sexual activity, although she denied ever having so engaged at the hearing. However, because there was no one to authenticate that medical record, it was inadmissible and improper for impeachment. Also, the record could not be used to show that the victim engaged in fantasy as there was no evidence that the statement in the record was either true or false; it was only helpful to defendant if it was false.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of conviction entered by the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) on a jury verdict finding her guilty of forgery, upon which sentence was imposed, including restitution for indigent defense services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of four counts of forgery. She was ordered to pay restitution to the board of indigent defense services. On appeal, the court held that two counts of the complaint were fatally defective. They failed to allege that defendant had knowledge that the checks were forged. Next, the court held that the trial court erred in failing to make findings on the record concerning defendant's financial resources and ability to pay prior to imposition of its order of reimbursement, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4610(4)(c). The trial court merely applied a simple mathematical formula derived from the hours spent by defense counsel and the overhead costs of the program in arriving at the sum imposed for restitution. The court also held that the trial court did not err in prohibiting defense counsel from cross-examining the state's handwriting expert about his record of accuracy in detecting forged signatures in previous cases. The evidence was totally irrelevant in tending to establish the expert's veracity as a witness. Lastly, the trial court should have made out of the hearing of the jury a statement depicting defense counsel as inexperienced and deserving admonition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's forgery convictions on two counts and reversed on two counts. The case was remanded for redetermination of whether reimbursement to the indigent defense services was appropriate after the trial court first stated on the record the defendant's financial resources and her ability to pay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a utility and corporate intervenors, sought review of a decision by appellee, the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC), which ordered that the utility's rate increase be refunded to utility users.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the time that the utility received a rate increase because of a new facility, KCC raised the rate increase because of the retirement of another facility. KCC then ordered that the increase be refunded. The utility claimed that KCC's decision was inconsistent with its prior order. The court held that the utility could have kept part of the increase but had to refund the rest because the decision was within KCC's zone of reasonableness. The court had jurisdiction under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-603 where the hearing stemmed from a rate hearing. Substantial evidence supported KCC's conclusion on how to calculate if the utility met the threshold to get the rate increase, even if KCC rejected its own staff's opinion and KCC changed its prior decision. However, where KCC did not consider whether the charitable distribution was reasonable, the contributions should not have been disallowed as an operating expense. Because the utility sold and did not buy power, the filed rate doctrine under the Federal Power Act did not preempt KCC's decision. Also, the utility had the right to challenge the refund again if there was a revenue shortfall. By stipulation, the intervenors' issues were moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision in favor of KCC, except that part of the decision was reversed in that KCC was required to consider the utility's charitable contributions as part of its operating expenses to determine how much the refund was to be. The intervenors' appeal was held to be moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee's principal complaint on appeal was that his due process rights were violated because the statutory scheme controlling his hearing and appeal rights, notably Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-2949(f) and Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-621(a)(1), placed the burden of proof on him. In affirming the judgment the court first observed that while the employee had a protected property interest in his state employment, due process generally was unconcerned with the allocation of the burden of proof in civil matters. Instead, notice and opportunity to be heard were the touchstones of due process these cases, and this was supplied by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-2949(b) and (d). The court then held that because the Board held that the employee failed to meet his burden of proof, and this was essentially a negative finding, the decision was reviewable under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-621(c)(8) only for an indication that it was arbitrary and capricious. The court noted that because the merits of the case resolved on the credibility of the testifying witnesses, the decision of the Board could not be disturbed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court refused to modify the support orders and awarded the mother attorney's fees and the father sought review. The court held that: (1) Kansas appellate courts had jurisdiction to entertain an appeal only if the appeal was taken within the statutory time limitations; (2) Kan. Stat.

On appeal, the court held that, although the hearing before the district court was de novo, a social worker's testimony concerning her notes from the magistrate's hearing was admissible under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-460(a) (Supp. 1989) because both the father and the stepmother were present at the hearing and available for cross-examination. Further, while the district court committed error in admitting the two children's hearsay statements without first conducting a Kan. Stat.

Moreover, the father's motion to dismiss was properly denied because even without the children's hearsay statements, there was sufficient evidence of a clear and convincing nature that the two children were in need of care. Finally, the terms used in Kan. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father and mother challenged the trial court's order, contending that there was not clear and convincing evidence to terminate their parental rights. The court affirmed the trial court's order because it found that there was substantial competent evidence of a clear and convincing quality to support the trial court's termination of parental rights. The court noted that the parents had IQ's in the low 60's, were &quot;inadequate intellectually&quot; to raise children, and had very limited parenting skills and abilities in as far as their understanding of how children grow developmentally. The court also noted that parenting lessons were unsuccessful and that there was evidence of both drugs and alcohol in the home. The court also ruled that the father and mother were not denied equal protection because the decision to terminate their parental rights was not made solely on the basis of the parents' mental deficiency but because their deficiency was of such duration or nature as to render them unlikely to care for the ongoing physical, mental and emotional needs of their children.</SPAN></P>

However, the court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because its terms were clear and it was limited in its application. The court noted that the ordinance's definition of the term &quot;weeds&quot; eliminated the possible application of the ordinance to decorative well-tended vegetation and that as a whole, the ordinance conveyed the warning that lots with overgrown vegetation and grass were proscribed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner sought review of an order granting summary judgment by the Douglas District Court (Kansas) in favor of defendants, a city, a city inspector, and a state historic preservation officer (SHPO), which dismissed the owner's challenge of a decision recommending the denial of a demolition permit for a building on its property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The building was situated about one block from a courthouse that was listed on the National register of Historic Places. The demolition permit was denied because the demolition would encroach upon, or damage or destroy the environs of the courthouse. The owners' appeal emanated from the implementation of the provisions of the Kansas Historic Preservation Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-2715 et seq. The court held the demolition of the building qualified as a project under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-2716(c). The court then held if the SHPO determined a project would encroach upon, damage, or destroy a historic property or its environs, the project was halted, and could only proceed if the governing body made certain determinations. The court found the owner was not denied due process because the owner did not establish a constitutionally protected interest. The court also found there was no unconstitutional taking of the owner's property. The court held it was arbitrary and unreasonable for the city to require the owner to dispel suggestions offered as reasonable alternatives to demolition. Therefore, the district court erred in granting summary judgment based on the owner's failure to do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment denying the owner relief and dismissing his appeal. The court reversed the order granting summary judgment for the city and remanded the case to the district court with directions to remand to the city for a new hearing on the owner's application for a demolition permit.</SPAN></P>

In granting the municipality's motion for summary judgment, the trial court held the rider failed to comply with Kan. Stat.

He also argued he should have been permitted to dismiss under &sect; 60-518, give a new notice under &sect; 12-105b(d), and start anew. The court affirmed the order granting summary judgment because the rider's failure to comply with the notice provisions of &sect; 12-105b(d) was dispositive and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the rider's attempt to dismiss under &sect; 60-518.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers were owners of commercial real estate in several counties. The taxpayers alleged that the 1986 constitutional reappraisal amendment was vague and indefinite, and that the procedures employed by the state director in implementing the amendment were illegal. The taxpayers originally filed an original action in mandamus and quo warranto in the Kansas Supreme Court, which transferred it to the Shawnee County District Court for trial. The court held that the taxpayers failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and therefore judgment on the pleadings was proper for the state director. The taxpayers could have filed a notice of dissatisfaction of the appraised value with the county appraiser or paid their taxes and filed a written statement of protest with the county treasurer. Either administrative remedy was available and one of them was required before a suit could be brought in court. The fact that those remedies could not address matters of constitutionality did not excuse the taxpayers from using administrative remedies. The taxpayers lacked standing to bring a suit if their claim that they were not seeking tax relief was correct.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed and set aside defendant's conviction. The court ruled that the conviction of defendant violated his due process rights because the jury was erroneously instructed that there were three elements of the crime that had to be proven, but that one of these elements, the element of parentage, did not need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that defendant's conviction, based on such an instruction, could not stand, because it violated defendant's rights under Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The mother alleged that, as a parent, she had standing to petition for habeas corpus on behalf of her children. The court held that that the mother lacked standing to bring the action. Because the mother had no legal rights to her former children, she could not bring an action on behalf of the children. The court held that the action was res judicata. The trial court was under no obligation to furnish a second opportunity to relitigate the termination of the mother's parental rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a divorce, the ex-husband was ordered to pay the ex-wife a total sum of money in monthly installments. The obligation was secured by a lien on property owned by the ex-husband. The ex-husband defaulted on the payments and the ex-wife brought suit. The original judgment ordering the payments had become dormant so the ex-wife filed a motion for revival and requested foreclosure on the property. The district court entered a default judgment against the ex-husband when he failed to answer the motion. The ex-wife put the property up for sale but the judgment was subsequently set aside. The ex-wife, ex-husband, and prospective buyers all sought review. On appeal, the court reversed the order setting aside the default judgment, holding that the ex-wife's motion was filed within the time prescribed for revival of the previous judgment. The court affirmed the granting of the revived the judgment. The court also reversed the order denying the prospective buyers' request to intervene, holding that they had an interest relating to the property that was the subject of the action.

The driver filed a petition for review, alleging that he did not receive the warning required by &sect; 8-1001(f)(1)(B) regarding mandatory suspension of a license upon refusal to take the breath test. On appeal, the court held that the administrative order suspending the driver's license did not violate any of the provisions for judicial review of the administrative decision under Kan. Stat.

The informant obtained a sample, at the urging of the police, by breaking into a locked freezer in defendant's back yard. The police then obtained a search warrant and found a large amount of marijuana in the freezer. Defendant's landlord later told police of a break-in at the home. A search for intruders, made while a telephone request for another search warrant was pending, led to the police's discovery of additional marijuana in a freezer. Defendant was convicted of two counts of possession of marijuana with intent to sell and sought review. On appeal, the court found that the informant had acted as an agent of the state in conducting the first search and seizure, which was illegal. The court also held that it was improper under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-2502(a) for the police to make a search warrant request over the telephone, for the issuing judge to fail to mechanically record the proceeding, and for the search warrant to be signed by a police officer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant sought public assistance to pay for housing during her hospitalization. SRS denied her assistance because she did not have any shelter costs, and she had been continually hospitalized for over five months. Its decision was based on Kansas Public Assistance Manual (KPAM) 3110. The district court affirmed the decision. The court held that KPAM 3110 was a valid statement of policy that SRS could utilize in determining aid eligibility. SRS intended KPAM 3110 to serve as a general statement of policy. SRS had statutory authority to institute policy regarding aid to persons temporarily absent from their homes for medical treatment. Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-5321 granted it authority to adopt all general policies relating to all forms of social services. SRS's order was supported by evidence indicating that the applicant did not need assistance to pay for housing. KPAM 3110 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution or &sect; 1 of the Bill of Rights of the Kansas Constitution. It was rationally related to the purpose of the social welfare act as stated in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39-701.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Butler District Court (Kansas), convicting defendant of two counts of aggravated incest against his two step-daughters in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3603. Specifically, defendant objected at trial to the use of the victims' videotaped testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to defendant's trial for aggravated incest, the State filed a motion to submit the youngest victim's testimony by videotape. Defendant objected and argued that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3434 was unconstitutional.&nbsp;Section 22-3434 allowed the trial court to allow videotaped testimony if the victim was less than 13 years old. The trial court granted the motion after hearing testimony from the child's counselor. The counselor testified that she had been seeing the child for some six months and was concerned by the trauma that testifying would have on the child. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that &sect; 22-3434 was constitutional and that defendant was not denied the right to confrontation. The right to confrontation was not absolute and had exceptions. The court noted that one such exception was where the child would be traumatized from testifying and would be unable to communicate the facts to the jury. There was sufficient evidence to convict because a factfinder could infer defendant's specific intent from the totality of the circumstances and defendant's actions. Similarly, a factfinder could infer specific intent from defendant's blatantly sexual acts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon defendant's entry of a guilty plea, he was convicted of first-degree murder and aggravated burglary. He was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder conviction and a term of five to 20 years on the aggravated burglary conviction. After 15 years of incarceration, defendant initiated a proceeding challenging the trial court's denial of relief. Defendant sought relief on the basis that his guilty plea was not voluntarily and knowingly made and that he was not afforded effective assistance of counsel. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that a specific waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination was not required. The court noted that the record was not silent and that there was substantial compliance with Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3210. The court found that, upon the evidence presented at the 60-1507 hearing, there was room for the trial court to find as fact that defendant's plea was voluntary and knowing. The court was persuaded that there was only a possibility, not a reasonable probability, that there would be a change of ruling on the question of admissibility of inculpatory statements made by defendant, which were not suppressed.</SPAN></P>

Psychological testing indicated that the woman had a functional age of between four and six years. Defendant admitted that he knew the woman was mentally retarded. Defendant claimed that Kan. Stat.

He argued that a known or apparent mental defect caused an inability to give consent. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. It held that the statute sufficiently warned a person of common intelligence that engaging in sexual intercourse with one who was mentally handicapped to a degree that she could not understand the nature and consequences of engaging in the act was prohibited. It found that under normal circumstances a mental incapacity to consent would be apparent in ordinary social intercourse. The fact that further question might be necessary to determine if one's partner fully understood the nature and consequences of sexual intercourse did not render the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandmother requested visitation with the three children and the trial court granted it. The mother contended the trial court's ruling violated her right to family privacy, which was a substantive due process right that was protected under the penumbras of the constitution. It appeared from the record, however, that the mother made no such argument before the trial court. When constitutional grounds for reversal were asserted for the first time on appeal, they were not properly before the appellate court. Under the doctrine of parens patriae, the state had the power to act and to grant grandparent visitation if it found such visitation was in the best interests of its children. The grandmother's testimony was substantial competent evidence to support the trial court's holding that there was a substantial relationship between parties. Because the legislature clearly intended that the grandmother pay attorney fees, and the trial court made no findings that justice and equity required otherwise, the trial court's order that the mother pay her own attorney fees was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle, arguing the single count in the complaint that resulted in the most recent conviction was duplicitous in that it alleged violation of &sect;&sect; 8-262, 8-287. The court read the count to allege violation of &sect;&sect; 8-262, 8-287 alternatively, not to allege violation of both laws duplicitously. For there to be a violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-262, there had to be driving while the operator's license was suspended or revoked. The trial court had taken judicial notice of its records that showed that in a separate case appellant's driver's license had been revoked and that per Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-286 he had been adjudicated an habitual violator of the motor-vehicle laws and ordered not to operate motor vehicles. Appellant asked the court to rule that the habitual-violator adjudication was invalid. The court refused because such a collateral attack was impermissible. Appellant could not by postconviction motion under Kan. Stat.

The ex-employee brought suit against his ex-employer for defamation and breach of employment contract and against his supervisor for tortious interference with an employment contract. The trial court dismissed the ex-employee's suit against the ex-employer and entered judgment in favor of the supervisor. The ex-employee appealed and the court affirmed. The court found that the ex-employee's constitutional challenge to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-714(f) (1988), which excluded his unemployment benefit hearing transcript from being entered into evidence was without merit. The ex-employee failed to show how the statute violated the separation of powers doctrine and the legislature had the power to prescribe new, and alter existing, rules of evidence. Thus, the legislature was authorized to enact discovery and evidentiary limitations regarding unemployment benefit hearing transcripts. The defamation claim failed because the ex-employee failed to show publication of his separation notice and failed to show malice on the part of the supervisor to overcome his qualified immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court instructed the jury on the elements of aggravated battery, and on battery as a lesser-included offense. In the aggravated battery instruction, the trial court stated that &quot;a .22 caliber rifle is a deadly weapon.&quot; Defendant allegedly used such a rifle in the commission of the crime. On appeal, the court held that it was harmful error, violative of the Due Process Clause, for the trial court to state that the rifle was a &quot;deadly weapon.&quot; The court noted that the State had the burden of proving every element of the offense, and it was unconstitutional for the trial court to relieve the State of part of that burden by means of a jury instruction. The court further noted that the issue of whether a weapon used in a crime of aggravated battery was, in fact, a &quot;deadly weapon,&quot; was a jury question, and depended on the manner of use of the weapon in the particular circumstances of each case. Applying the Kansas harmless error rule, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-2105, to the trial court's federal constitutional error, the court held that it could not state beyond a reasonable doubt that it believed the error had little, if any, likelihood of having changed the trial result.</SPAN></P>

The claim was first heard by an administrative law judge (ALJ), who denied it in its entirety. The workers' compensation director reversed the ALJ and awarded the claimant compensation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant testified that he re-injured or aggravated a lower back condition while on the job for the employer. The claimant indicated that he mentioned the re-injury to his foreman, but did not see anyone at the plant medical facility. For several months following the injury, the claimant was seeing an orthopedic surgeon for problems relating to injuries to his elbow and did not mention the back injury. The claimant was forced to leave his employment because of the injuries to his elbows, for which he was awarded a 100 percent disability award. On appeal, the court held the district court's standard of review of the director's decision was de novo. The court concluded that while the evidence was conflicting on the question of whether the claimant sustained personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment, there was ample substantial competent evidence to sustain the district court's judgment. The court found that the claim for compensation failed not on the issue of whether the claimant's disability was &quot;work&quot; or &quot;functional,&quot; but on the fact that the claimant failed to establish a compensable cause for his disability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The information charged defendant with assault with a deadly weapon, &quot;to wit: a knife.&quot; The trial court's instruction and aggravated assault did not refer to the knife, and only required that the jury find that defendant used a deadly weapon. Because there was some testimony that defendant initially brandished a weapon at the victim, he claimed that the charge permitted the jury to find him guilty of assault with a pipe in contrast to the information. The court held that the instruction was more broad than the instruction. However, his substantial rights were not violated. The instruction followed the language of the statute and sufficient evidence existed to support each element of the charge as described in the instruction. The information fully advised defendant that he was charged with aggravated assault. Because defendant denied having any weapons, his defense would have been no different with a more narrow jury instruction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The club owners argued that Wichita, Kan., Ordinance No. 39-923 violated Kan. Const. art. 15, &sect; 10 (1986), which prohibited cities from passing ordinances governing drinking establishments that were allowed by county vote and subject only to county government control. The trial court found that the ordinance was constitutional, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the only restriction placed on cities was that the ordinance could not conflict with or be contrary to the provisions of the Kansas Liquor Control Act. The state did not expressly authorize or license nudity or semi-nudity in drinking establishments; therefore, the city's ban on nudity or semi-nudity was merely additional to and did not conflict with the existing state law. The court held that the ordinance was not vague and that it was a proper exercise of the city's police power, which could regulate and restrict activities in the interest of the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the victim had known each other for about three and one-half years prior to the incident. Defendant and the victim had dated on and off during those years, had lived together on occasion, and were the parents of a daughter. Over the course of the relationship, defendant had both physically and verbally abused the victim. On the night in question, defendant arrived at the victim's house unannounced and demanding sex. The victim refused, but defendant threatened her and physically shook her. The victim finally relented and had intercourse with defendant. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for aggravated sexual battery. It was clear that the victim engaged in intercourse only after repeatedly refusing and out of fear. This fear was reasonable based on the situation and previous incidents. The prosecutor was within his discretion in charging defendant with aggravated sexual battery instead of rape. The facts supported either charge, but it was up to the prosecutor to choose which one to charge. The court held that K.S.A. &sect; 21-3518(1)(c) was not unconstitutionally vague for failure to include a definition for lack of consent.</SPAN></P>

The motion was denied by the district court. On appeal, the court looked to case law from other jurisdictions in reaching the conclusion that the pharmacy was an occupied building. &quot;Occupancy&quot; was broadly construed because the legislature intended a harsher punishment for the robbery of occupied buildings. The determination of occupancy was based on the possibility of contact between the occupants and defendant. The aggravated burglary statute,&nbsp;Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3716, was not unconstitutionally vague because the terms used were not vague or indefinite.

Defendant was sentenced and placed on probation, with conditions that he pay restitution for damage to the car and reimburse the State Board of Indigents' Defense Services for attorney fees. The court stated that the statutory language of Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff's office received a report that there was a dead horse on defendant's property. When an officer investigated, he found no dead horse but found 29 &quot;very thin&quot; horses. The officer noted that there was only a small amount of grass available to the animals and saw no supplemental feed. Several months later, a veterinarian went to the property pursuant to a search warrant and performed a necropsy on a dead horse. The animal's bones were showing, there was no muscle, that there was no fat, and parasites did not cause the animal's death. The sheriff's department seized 34 horses from defendant's property. Defendant contended that the information was fatally defective because it alleged that she had unlawful possession of her own horses and because it failed to allege willfulness. The court reversed the conviction. The information was not defective. The statute only required &quot;physical custody&quot; of the animals, and the violation only required willfulness. However, a jury instruction was erroneous because it failed to include willfulness as an essential element and denied defendant her theory of defense. At trial, she testified that she did not willfully fail to provide food.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a college student, was banned from campus because of his numerous social problems. With knowledge of the ban order, defendant subsequently went to the handicapped student services office located on the campus. He was arrested and ultimately convicted of criminal trespass in violation of &sect; 21-3721. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute, but his challenge was denied. The court held that the statute clearly gave the university's board of regents the authority to prepare the ban order. The court further held that defendant was banned because of his conduct as opposed to his speech, so the statute did not deny defendant his First Amendment personal rights. The court also concluded that defendant was not entitled to notice and a hearing before issuance of the ban order. Finally, the court held that the trial court's erroneous admission of evidence of defendant's prior bad acts was not reversible error in light of the adequacy of the proper evidence pointing toward defendant's guilt.</SPAN></P>

The corporation considered its taxicab drivers to be independent contractors. Under a lease agreement, the corporation was required to obtain all registration, tags, licenses, and permits required by law to operate the taxicabs. The drivers had to pay a rental fee to the corporation according to a schedule in the lease agreement. After an investigation, the Department determined that the drivers were employees of the corporation. The corporation requested an administrative hearing. An administrative law judge determined the drivers were employees, not independent contractors. The Department and the trial court affirmed. On appeal, the court found that the corporation's use of the percentage option in its lease agreement indicated that the corporation had an interest in maintaining some element of control over its drivers. The drivers were penalized monetarily for arriving late for a shift, and they were required by the corporation to keep trip sheets. The court concluded that the drivers were employees and upheld the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Early one morning in Kansas City, Missouri, police officers, while on a stakeout, heard yelling in an adjoining parking lot. They saw two men standing near a car and heard a noise. The men then sped off in another car at a high rate of speed with the headlights extinguished. The police officers pursued the car. They also requested assistance from Kansas police agencies. The car was stopped by an officer from Westwood, Kansas. Defendant was charged with possession of burglary tools in violation of &sect; 21-3717. No charges were filed in Missouri. A jury found him guilty of the charged offense. He was sentenced to prison for 3 to 15 years. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that Kansas had jurisdiction over the matter because it could be concluded that defendant still possessed the tools with the intent to utilize them in automobile burglaries. It also found that &sect; 21-3717 gave fair warning to those persons who were potentially subject to it and was not unconstitutionally vague. Moreover, there was sufficient evidence from which to infer that defendant had the intent needed to establish the illegal possession of burglary tools.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Wyandotte District Court (Kansas), which denied his post-conviction motion under Kan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that his prior conviction was based on an unconstitutional statute, that the trial court erred in dismissing his post-conviction motion without a hearing, and that the trial judge should not have heard the motion because he had presided at defendant's trial. In affirming, the court ruled that the prior offense was remarkably similar to the circumstances of the murder charge, in both of which offenses he had allegedly battered an infant in similar fashion. The court also ruled the fact that &sect; 21-3431 had later been found to be unconstitutional had no effect on the relevance of the evidence of the prior crime and that the trial evidence included detailed testimony regarding the circumstances of the previous episode and not simply introduction of documentation of the conviction. The court ruled further that defendant's allegations of unfair comments by the trial judge and pretrial publicity were not raised in his direct appeal and were not subject to review by post-conviction motion because he did not aver they were constitutional defects. Finally, the court held that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1507(a) specifically required the trial judge to hear the motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer stopped defendant and asked for identification after observing him drive erratically. A routine check revealed that defendant's license had been revoked, that he had been declared an habitual violator under Kan. Stat.

On appeal, defendant argued that the stop was unreasonable, that evidence obtained should have been suppressed, and that his conviction and sentencing violated his right to counsel because his status as a habitual violator was predicated upon uncounseled misdemeanor convictions. The court, in affirming defendant's conviction, first found that the officer had a reasonable suspicion, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-2402, to stop defendant, based on his abnormal driving, and that the trial court correctly denied the motion to suppress evidence. Next, reasoning that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-287 was not a sentencing enhancement statute, the court held that defendant's right to counsel was not violated because criminal penalties imposed after defendant was determined to be a habitual violator were not based on the prior misdemeanor convictions but upon his criminal act of driving thereafter.</SPAN></P>

No. 54.01 (2 ed.), which had been held constitutionally proper as constituting a permissible inference rather than a rebuttable presumption. The court determined that there was no basis for setting aside petitioner's sentence because it was within the statutory limitations of Kan. Stat.

The court held that the mere fact that the authority received rental income did not constitute &quot;use&quot; within the meaning of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-201a Second (Supp. 1987). The court concluded that the authority was not entitled to a statutory exemption under &sect; 79-201a Second. The court held that the investigation issue was not moot. The court found that BOTA did not have the express or implied power to order a county appraiser to investigate property that was not the subject of a controversy brought before BOTA.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a gun shop and purchased two firearms, paying for them with a forged check and presenting false identification. When defendant was subsequently apprehended by police, he was charged with felony theft, forgery, and unlawful possession of a firearm. Defendant was convicted of all charges, and he appealed his convictions. In reversing in part, the court vacated defendant's conviction of felony theft in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3701 (Supp. 1987). The elements of the felony charge of &quot;obtaining by deception control over property&quot; with the &quot;intent to deprive the owner permanently of the possession, use, or benefit of the owner's property&quot; were proved by the proof necessary to prove the forgery charges and were therefore multiplicitous. Defendant could not be convicted of two or more separate crimes where the theft offense was a crime necessarily proved by evidence of the forgery, as the making of the forged check and its delivery to the clerk in the gun shop were immediately followed by defendant's exiting from the store with the guns and ammunition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's forgery conviction was vacated. Defendant's remaining convictions were affirmed, but the matter was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

After the Board brought a tax foreclosure action, the taxpayers alleged that the assessment was so invalid and unfair as to amount to constructive fraud. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the Board was proper. The court noted that the taxpayers were required to exhaust their administrative remedy under the Acts before they could resort to the courts. The court noted that the remedy under the Acts was available even to delinquent taxpayers, such as those in the current case. The court rejected the taxpayer's argument that the issue of constructive fraud could be raised for the first time in a court, pursuant to a court's authority under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-2803 to investigate such matters in a tax foreclosure action. The court found that a 1906 Kansas case, which contained a holding to that effect, was no longer valid law in light of the subsequent establishment of the remedies contained in the Acts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, two items of collateral source benefit were introduced. The first was a copy of the medical facility's emergency room form. The words &quot;has Teamsters&quot; were entered in the insurance blank. The court found that, if the admission was erroneous, it was an invited error because the patient first offered the form as evidence. The court noted that the patient could not have invited the error, and then complained of the error on appeal. The court also ruled, however, that it was reversible error for the trial court to permit defense counsel to cross-examine the patient on the reimbursement the patient received for his medical expenses. While the statute effective at the time of trial provided for the admission of such evidence, the court ruled that the admission was inherently prejudicial. In so ruling, the court observed that the statute was subsequently declared to be unconstitutional. Moreover, the court relied upon a prior decision that the policy concerns for excluding evidence of collateral source benefits was the same as that which excluded evidence of liability insurance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the State improperly charged him with committing indecent liberties with a child, that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3434(a)(1) (Supp. 1987) violated the Confrontation Clauses of the United States and Kansas Constitutions, and that the trial court erred in admitting an expert's testimony that she could not conclude that defendant was not a sexual offender. On appeal, the court held that defendant was properly charged and that he need not be charged instead with the more specific offense of aggravated incest. The State could elect among statutes. With regard to the second issue, the court held that &sect; 22-3434(a)(1) was not unconstitutional where the statute allowed the minor victim to testify by closed-circuit television out of the presence of defendant. Defendant's attorney was in the room with the victim and cross-examined her intensively. Further, defendant was permitted to observe the child directly through a one-way mirror while she testified.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-4127b(b)(2) (1987 Supp.), defendant was convicted in the Wyandotte District Court (Kansas) of four counts of sale of methamphetamine and one count of sale of amphetamine. On appeal, the issues included whether a prior conviction should have been admitted, whether exclusion of evidence offered by defendant was reversible error, whether the crimes were proven, and whether a chain of custody for certain evidence was shown.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that testimony concerning defendant's prior conviction for sale of preludin was properly admitted because it was relevant to prove that he intentionally sold the drugs in issue. His intent was an issue because he raised the defense of entrapment. Nor did the district court abuse its discretion in concluding that the probative value of the prior conviction to prove identity outweighed its prejudicial effect. Once the evidence was admitted, the jury was properly instructed on the limited purpose for which the conviction could be used. The court noted that, even if it were error to admit the conviction, the error was harmless and would not require reversal. But, even if defendant's excluded evidence was admissible under some theory, the court could not say that its admission would have changed the result, so there was no reversible error. The court held that the State proved a prima facie case for sale of the controlled substances. Because defendant failed to object to the admission of certain evidence on the ground of a deficiency in the chain of custody, the issue was not properly before the court, and there was no merit to the claim of error anyway.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff appealed, and the KDR cross-appealed. The court concluded that plaintiff was entitled to a de novo review of his driver's license suspension under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-259 (Supp. 1985). The court concluded that the agency action was &quot;judicial&quot; in nature and that, therefore, the trial court was not restricted to the more limited review exercised in the review of &quot;nonjudicial&quot; agency actions where new evidence was admissible as to the limited issue before the court on appeal. The court held that the trial court did not err in considering evidence on the field sobriety tests, because this issue was not raised before the hearing officer. Further, the court concluded that there was substantial competent evidence to support the trial court's finding that the police officer had reasonable grounds to believe plaintiff was driving under the influence.

Affirming, the court found that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad because the identical state statute was upheld with a narrow construction that it applied only to &quot;fighting words.&quot; Defendant's conviction conformed to constitutional standards because the jury was instructed to find that defendant's speech constituted fighting words. The complaint was not fatally defective because intent was not an element of the offence and it had to be construed to apply only to fighting words. The instruction concerning fighting words was not erroneous and prejudicial, but were fully consistent with United States and Kansas definitions of fighting words. The conviction was supported by sufficient evidence, including testimony that defendant directed racial slurs and obscenities at various store customers and a police officer, and that he slammed a metal rack onto a counter and grabbed a customer by the shirt. Defendant's actions in conjunction with his provocative language was sufficient to constitute a breach of the peace.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver alleged that, due to his sincere religious belief that prohibited drawing blood, refusing to submit to the blood test did not justify suspending his driving privileges. The court reversed the district court's judgment, concluding that requiring the driver to submit to a blood test to retain his driving privileges impermissibly burdened his First Amendment right of free exercise of religion. The consent that that &sect; 8-1001 envisioned was implied and the consent was coerced by a fear of the adverse consequences in instances in which the consent was not forthcoming. The reasonable availability of a breath test also showed that there was not substantial competent evidence to support the finding that the state trooper used the least restrictive means of determining the driver's blood alcohol level. The driver consented to a breath test, the trooper did not ask the hospital staff if the injuries that the driver sustained in the car accident prevented him from taking a blood test, and the delay in giving the breath test did not justify violating the driver's right to freely exercise his religion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a unanimous council vote, the city revoked the kennel owners' license based on testimony that the kennel was causing odor, had an excessive number of dogs, causing health problems and creating excessive noise. The city sought injunctive relief from the kennel owners' continued operation of the facility without a license. The kennel owners filed a separate action alleging that the revocation of their license was illegal, arbitrary, and capricious, violated both common law and constitutional law, and exceeded the scope of the city's authority. The cases were consolidated, and the trial court affirmed the city's revocation. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the phrase in the ordinance requiring dog kennels to be kept free of dirt and filth and be operated so as not to be offensive to the health, safety, and welfare, standing alone, was so vague that people of common intelligence were left to guess at its meaning. The court reasoned that a regulatory ordinance must be clear, definite and certain, so that the average person can with due care, after reading it, understand and ascertain whether he will incur a penalty for particular acts or courses of conduct.</SPAN></P>

The board decided to go ahead with the plans. The taxpayer obtained a temporary restraining order that prevented the board from cutting or harming any tress on the grounds.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant used a public phone in a pharmacy to call the local newspaper to complain. A witness stated that defendant was shouting obscenities and was engaged in offensive name calling. One of the pharmacy owners called the police. When the police arrived, defendant made derogatory remarks to the officers, who then arrested him and took him to the police station. Defendant told a contrary version of the events. On appeal, defendant claimed as trial errors an insufficient complaint, insufficient evidence, and the unconstitutionality of the ordinance. In reversing the conviction, the court held that the ordinance, &sect; 5.24.030, was unconstitutional because it forbade actions in terms so vague that persons of common intelligence would necessarily have to guess as to its meaning and differ as to its application. The court rejected the city's argument that case law required the ordinance to be authoritatively construed to apply only to &quot;fighting words&quot; and, when so construed, it was constitutionally applied. The court commented that it was highly doubtful that the city had much of a legitimate interest in punishment of name calling between private parties.</SPAN></P>

The debtors appealed and the court affirmed, finding that the default judgment was voidable for failure to give notice of the default to the debtors under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-255(a). There was no abuse of process because the judgment was valid on its face at the time of seizure and the creditor had no ulterior motive for its action except enforcement of its promissory note.

He was ultimately convicted of driving with a blood alcohol content greater than .10 percent in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1567(a)(1), and he appealed. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, and found that, contrary to defendant's argument, &sect; 8-1567(a)(1) was constitutional. Defendant asserted that a Nebraska case demonstrated the unreliability of an Intoxilyzer, and that the unreliability was cause to find &sect; 8-1567(a)(1)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The court found that the Nebraska decision was inapplicable because the Nebraska court determined that the legislature could not by statute establish the evidentiary weight to be given to the test results. The court also found that the complaint conferred jurisdiction in the trial court because it alleged all the essential facts that constituted the crime. Further, a police officer was properly permitted to testify regarding the digital display reading of the Intoxilyzer machine because the testimony was based upon his observation of the digital display and was not an attempt to prove the content of a digital print out.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction, concluding that he did not show any basis for not adhering to precedent that established that Kan. Stat.

The record showed that, after subtracting the period of delay that was attributable to defendant, the trial was timely. Defendant's request for diversion and his failure to appear for one scheduled trial caused a portion of the delay, and the portion of the delay that resulted from the State searching for a prior conviction for DUI was also attributable to defendant because that search was only conducted after the request for diversion was filed.

The trial court held that the debtor's disclaimer of interest in the accounts under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59-2293(a) did not relate back to the date of her sister's death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The creditor claimed that the debtor was not a real party in interest and that the appeal was untimely. The court held that the debtor's timely motion to vacate was, in effect, a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-259(f), which extended the time for appeal in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-2103(a). Further, because the debtor's right to disclaim her interest in the accounts was at issue, the debtor was a real party in interest. The court opined that, because the trial court's final judgment was entered prior to the debtor's attempt to disclaim her interest in the accounts, her right to disclaim was barred. In the court's view, when the debtor failed to reply to the garnishee's answer, which alleged that she possessed an interest in joint tenancy accounts, the debtor's interest was properly deemed to be confessed under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-718(c). Finally, the portion of the trial court's order requiring the executors of an estate to pay the debtor's share of the estate into the court was not a final, appealable judgment because it did not fix the rights and liabilities of all the parties. Thus, the debtor was not entitled to relief from that order on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner challenged an order of the Leavenworth District Court (Kansas), which dismissed petitioner's requests for writs of habeas corpus regarding his incarceration and that denied his motion for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissals and the denial of the motion for reconsideration were based on the finding of a failure to exhaust the administrative remedies. The court affirmed the district court's judgments, concluding that the claim that petitioner did not have to follow the administrative procedure as to defending himself against the disciplinary charges because that procedure deprived him of his due process rights was invalid because the procedure provided the due process that was required as to prison disciplinary proceedings. Petitioner also failed to verify that he exhausted all of the administrative procedures as to administrative segregation because he did not allege that he had submitted a written request for release to the administrative segregation review board, that he had made a written complaint to the review board about allegedly not following required procedures, or that he had utilized the grievance process to complain about the decision to impose or to continue administrative segregation. Imposing the court costs did not deprive petitioner of meaningful access to the courts because the costs were imposed after determining that he was not entitled to the writs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision by the Shawnee District Court (Kansas), which convicted him of commercial gambling and conspiracy to commit commercial gambling. Defendant claimed that a portion of the commercial gambling statute,&nbsp;Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4304(b), was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite and that the charge of conspiracy to commit commercial gambling merged with the substantive crime of commercial gambling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendant expressly admitted receiving bets from at least seven people and betting with many others. A witness testified that he paid defendant to forward bets to him, and defendant admitted sending bets to the witness. The trial court instructed the jury that defendant committed commercial gambling if he intentionally received, recorded, or forwarded bets or offers to bet, and that he could be found guilty of the lesser included offense of gambling if he made a bet. Defendant claimed it was impossible to tell what he did to make his crime commercial gambling rather than simple gambling. On review, the court found that &sect; 21-4304(b) was constitutional. It found that gambling and commercial gambling were distinctive offenses because gambling required only one bet and was unconcerned with mere offers while commercial gambling concerned more than one bet or offer to bet. The court found that conspiracy to commit commercial gambling did not merge with the substantive crime of commercial gambling because defendant's own testimony showed that he committed the crime by receiving and recording bets and conspired to commit the same crime by agreeing to forward bets to the witness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Johnson District Court (Kansas), which convicted him of violating City of Overland Park, Kan., Municipal Ordinance &sect; 12.04.030, prohibiting a person from operating or attempting to operate a vehicle within the city while the alcohol concentration in the person's blood of breath is .10 or more, as measured from samples taken within two hours after the person operated or attempted to operate the vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that &sect; 12.04.030 was unconstitutional vague because, short of scientific testing, the average driver could not ascertain when his or her breath or blood alcohol level exceeded the legal limit. Section 12.04.030 was substantially similar to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1567(a)(1)(Supp. 1986) and &sect; 8-1567 survived the same challenge defendant made to the municipal ordinance. The test to determine whether a criminal statute was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite was whether its language conveys a sufficiently definite warning as to the conduct proscribed when measured by common understanding and practice. The language of an ordinance was clear when measured by common understanding and practice, it conveyed a sufficiently definite warning as to the conduct proscribed when measured by common understanding and practice. A statute that either required or forbid the doing of an act in terms so vague that persons of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application was violative of due process. The language of Overland Park, Kan., Municipal Ordinance &sect; 12.04.030 was clear.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision from the Ford District Court (Kansas), which convicted him by jury of three counts of unlawful sale of a security in violation of Kan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who owned a number of companies, hired others to sell to investors fractional interests in oil and gas leases owned by one of the companies. He was convicted of diverting the money either to himself or to his other companies. On appeal, the court held defendant suffered no prejudice by the delay between the time the crime was committed and the commencement of prosecution and the State had not used the delay to gain an advantage. Furthermore, the language of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17-1253 was, on its face, sufficient to inform a person of ordinary intelligence exactly what conduct was prohibited. The court additionally found that the State showed a good faith effort to obtain the presence of a witness before it was permitted to use previously transcribed testimony of the witness. Moreover, defendant's involvement with other companies was presented to show the nature of his investment scheme and was properly admitted. In affirming, the court found that while defendant's crimes were accomplished by the same unlawful scheme, he intended to defraud three distinct victims. Thus, defendant's convictions were not multiplicitous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's probation was revoked after he was charged with two counts of indecent liberties with a child. Defendant did not execute an appeal within the statutory 130-day period, however, the district court granted a motion for leave to file a notice of appeal out of time. The appellate court dismissed the appeal. The court held that the district court lacked authority to grant the motion and it dismissed the appeal. The court affirmed defendant's conviction on the two counts of indecent liberties with a child. The court held that while the prosecutor's statement as to his opinion of defendant's testimony and his witness was improper, reversible error did not occur. The court noted that defendant did not object to the testimony, which was required, and that the district court instructed the jury that it was the judge of the credibility of the witnesses. In addition, the prosecutor's attempt to elicit expert testimony that defendant committed the crime did not cause prejudicial error because the question was not answered. The court found that the jury instruction was not clearly erroneous and accurately stated the elements of the offense.</SPAN></P>

One of his two appeals set aside his aggravated sodomy conviction; Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3505 did not permit a husband to be convicted of sodomy or aggravated sodomy of his wife. Neither appeal presented the issues he presently urged in this Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1507 motion. Petitioner neither alleged nor showed exceptional circumstances that would excuse his not including the issue of whether a life sentence imposed for a conviction of aggravated kidnapping constituted cruel and unusual punishment in either of his prior appeals. He presented no change in the law that would justify entertaining an issue that was available for appeal when his prior appeals were filed. Absent petitioner's showing of exceptional circumstances excusing his failure to appeal the constitutionality of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3421 in either of his prior appeals, pursuant to Kan. Sup.

The wife asserted that the immunizations unconstitutionally violated her religious beliefs. The court affirmed the trial court decision and concluded that the trial court had continuing jurisdiction to consider the best interests of the children and the immunizations were in their best interests. The court stated that since the wife had made no claim of a religious principle that was affected by the immunizations at the trial court she could not advance the argument for the first time at the appellate court. The court concluded that there was no obligation in the divorce decree to pay medical bills that were not valid and there was no obligation to pay maintenance when the wife did not comply with the obligation to attend college.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of his probation revocation, defendant was ordered the complete his sentence for sale of marijuana. He waived his right to a hearing and admitted the allegations in his warrant. Defendant alleged that the revocation violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses because the trial court had failed to determine whether his failure to pay the fine was willful. The court affirmed the district court's judgment. The court noted that only if alternative measures were inadequate to meet the State's interests in punishment and deterrence could a trial court imprison a probationer who had made sufficient bona fide efforts to pay. Such a deprivation of liberty would violate the fundamental fairness required by the Fourteenth Amendment. However, the trial court relied on an additional ground in revoking defendant's probation, the fact that he failed to report to his probation officer. The trial court had a valid basis for the revocation, independent of the failure to pay the fine.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the natural mother had to have the opportunity to prove that the consent was void or voidable because of her inability to understand and fully comprehend what she was doing when the consent form was signed, owing to medication and/or the stress and pain of having given birth to a child shortly before; (2) the trial court should hear the issue and then make appropriate findings; and (3) depending on what the trial court's findings were, the trial court had to deny the motion to set aside the consent or set aside the adoption and consent and return the child to the natural mother.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with causing a dog fight in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4315 (Supp. 1986). During trial, the State moved to amend the complaint to include the misdemeanor crime of attending a dog fight in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;21-4315(c). Defendant was convicted of the lesser charge; he appealed his conviction. In reversing, the court concluded that, where the amendment to the complaint was never reduced to writing, the district court lacked jurisdiction to convict defendant of attending the dog fight. A conviction upon a charge not made in the information or properly brought before the court was a clear denial of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. In criminal actions, the trial court must not only have jurisdiction over the offense charged, but it must also have jurisdiction of the question that its judgment assumes to decide.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner's earlier case stated only a conclusionary contention that he was held illegally, unlawfully, and unconstitutionally without specifying the factual basis for the contention. Since he subsequently alleged a different basis for his cause of action and named different party defendants, petitioner was not precluded from asserting his claims because of the doctrine of res judicata. Petitioner also alleged that the adult authority denied him parole each year from 1981 to 1984 when it passed further consideration of the possibility of his parole until his conditional release date. He contended that the decision deprived him of the right guaranteed by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3717 (Supp. 1986) to a hearing at intervals.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for the University and submitted a false time card entry. A director of the University decided that the employee had violated work rules and imposed a five-day suspension without pay. After the Board upheld that determination, the employee filed a petition for judicial review in the district court. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the discipline. The court found that the University's action was not unconstitutional because the director conducted the investigation and the Board performed the adjudication. The court determined that two notice letters provided the employee with sufficient information to apprise him of the incident that gave rise to the disciplinary action and informed him of an opportunity to respond. The court decided that the requirement in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-2949 that notice be provided by the appointing authority, the University, rather than its designee, the director, was directory and not mandatory. Thus the court concluded that the employee's due process rights were not violated by noncompliance with &sect; 75-2949.

Defendant contended that he could not a habitual violator pursuant to &sect; 8-284 because one of the convictions, which served as a basis for the ruling, was constitutionally void as he was not represented by counsel. The court disagreed because a proceeding under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-286, which determined whether a person was a habitual violator, was civil in nature. The prior convictions of defendant in the habitual offender action were not subject to attack in an action under &sect; 8-286 based upon allegations that defendant was deprived of his constitutional rights in the prior criminal cases. Defendant was only being deprived of his privilege to drive in the habitual offender action, there were no further criminal sanctions being imposed, and therefore the protections applicable in criminal action were not available in the civil proceeding. The court rejected the contention that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-284 had been partially repealed by implication because it was in conflict with the later enacted Kan. Stat.

The court found that the animal cruelty statute was not void for vagueness where the statute as written conveyed a sufficiently definite warning as to the conduct proscribed. The court noted that food, potable water, protection from the elements and opportunity for exercise were basic essentials for the life and health of any animal and that sufficient evidence supported defendant's conviction where the jury heard testimony from veterinarians and a Humane Society official that 16 horses at the ranch had been so deprived of adequate food that their bodies were feeding off their muscle tissue to keep them alive. Pictures, slides and samples of hair from the horses' coats were admitted into evidence, which showed the bloated stomachs and visible pelvic bones, ribs and spines demonstrating malnutrition.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested by a city police officer for driving under the influence (DUI) and was thereafter charged with DUI by a complaint filed by the arresting officer in the district court rather than in the municipal court. Defendant was a first-time offender; under the policy of the municipal court, he would have been eligible for a diversion program. However, the county attorney had a policy that make drug and alcohol offenders ineligible for diversion. After defendant was convicted in district court, he appealed, arguing that his right to equal protection of the law had been violated. In affirming, the court concluded that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 22-2907 and 22-2908 (Supp. 1979), which authorized the institution of diversion programs, did not require a prosecutor to implement a diversion program but left the decision to the discretion of each county prosecutor. A prosecutor's failure to implement a diversion program authorized by statute did not result in a violation of the defendant's equal protection and due process rights.

</DIV>

Precedent established that including a grievance procedure in a collective bargaining agreement eliminated a unionized employee's cause of action for retaliatory discharge, and the appellate court was obliged to adhere to that precedent given that there was no indication that it was not valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from his conviction for simple battery in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3412, defendant contended that the restitution statute,&nbsp;Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4610(4)(a), contained no procedural guidelines and rules to assist judges in determining the amount of restitution, thus, the statute violated the due process clause. The court rejected defendant's contention and affirmed the conviction and restitution order. Specifically, the court held that general laws, already in existence, adequately provided procedural guidelines to enforce rights generally, and were sufficient to afford due process in matters arising under the restitution statute. Furthermore, the court found that defendant was without standing to make the due process challenge to the restitution statute because he had notice of the hearing to determine the amount of restitution and he was afforded the opportunity to be heard. Additionally, defendant did not even assert that his procedural due process rights were violated. Finally, it was not error to require defendant to pay restitution to the victim in order to cover the victim's medical expenses because the victim's wound was caused by defendant's battery.</SPAN></P>

The motorcycles were ordered from the manufacturer under a financing arrangement.

Defendant did not pay for the motorcycles as required and when the dealership closed, he owed the manufacturer over $ 250,000 for motorcycles that he sold but did not pay. Defendant was charged with impairing a security interest by failing to account to a secured party. Defendant denied any criminal intent and challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 21-3734(1)(c). Defendant was convicted and appealed. The court held that &sect; 21-3734(1)(c) violated &sect; 16 of the Bill of Rights of the Kansas Constitution because it did not require proof of fraud.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employee brought suit against defendant former employer after she was terminated. After the civil service board upheld her termination, the employee sought review under the Act for Judicial Review and Civil Enforcement of Agency Actions, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-601 et seq. The Shawnee District Court (Kansas) affirmed the board's decision. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was accused of abusing residents in a health care facility. The court first held that the trial court correctly decided that the employee had not met her burden of showing prejudice resulting from the employer's failure to follow its own procedures. Next, the court considered the employee's claim that her due process rights had been violated in that she did not have an opportunity to effectively cross-examine a co-worker who allegedly witnessed the abuse. It stated that although the employer had refused to identify its witnesses prior to the hearing before the board, the employee's attorney had chosen not to delay the proceeding when the co-worker's identify was revealed. Furthermore, the employee had not raised the claim in her application for rehearing by the board; therefore, it could not be considered on appeal. Moreover, the court added, the employee had not been prejudiced by the testimony. It stated that the employee had ample opportunity to question the witness's memory and reporting and that it was difficult to imagine what additional evidence the employee could have obtained to impeach the witness had she been informed of her identity earlier.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction of aggravated failure to appear that was entered in the Johnson District Court (Kansas). Defendant contended that the complaint on the charge was fatally defective and did not confer jurisdiction, that the trial court left an essential element of the charge from its jury instruction, and that he was wrongfully convicted on an aggravated charge because the underlying charge had been reduced to a misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with felony criminal damages and released on bond but failed to appear. A bench warrant was issued for his arrest. The charge was ultimately reduced to a misdemeanor. Defendant was tried and convicted on the charge of aggravated failure to appear. On appeal defendant contended that the complaint was defective because it did not charge him with &quot;willfully incurring a forfeiture.&quot; The court held that the language used in the complaint fairly apprised defendant of the charge and was not fatally defective. The court held that the contested jury instruction contained all the necessary elements for use in both felony and misdemeanor cases. The failure to instruct the jury that it had to find that defendant was charged with a felony when he failed to appear was not clearly erroneous. The court held that defendant's ultimate success on the predicate charge did not excuse or justify his failure to obey a court order directing his appearance. The statute was enacted to make bond jumping a criminal offense in itself, separate and distinct from the underlying offense on which the bond was issued. The offense was not dependent upon the outcome of the underlying charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Though defendant claimed several issues on appeal, the court only addressed the one that she had also raised in the trial court, namely that Ottawa, Kan. City Code &sect; 13-102(b) (1986) was unconstitutionally vague. Defendant's argument was premised on the fact that though &sect; 13-102(b) declared that no person shall operate a vehicle in the city while the alcohol concentration in the person's blood or breath is &quot;.10 or more,&quot; it failed to adequately define &quot;alcohol concentration.&quot; On appeal, the court ruled that its obligation was to presume statutes to be constitutional and resolve all doubts in favor of their validity. Because it found that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1005(a) (1985 Supp.) specifically addressed prosecutions for violation of state laws and city ordinances dealing with operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, and that the definition of &quot;alcohol concentration&quot; in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1005(b) (1985 Supp.), namely &quot;the number of grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or per 210 liters of breath&quot; was sufficiently specific, and that a person of ordinary intelligence would recognize its applicability to the ordinance, the ordinance was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The watershed district appealed from the verdict of the jury in favor of the landowners for damages amounting to $ 75 per hole in the landowner's cropland. The trial court granted judgment based on the number of holes drilled. The landowners also filed a cross-appeal concerning the measure of damages and the constitutionality of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24-1218, which authorized the District's conduct. The court reversed and held that the verdict returned by the jury was not supported by the evidence and failed to provide a sufficiently definite basis for the entry of judgment. The court held that while the evidence did support the conclusion that the landowners sustained damages by virtue of the drilling itself and the manner in which the holes were refilled, as well as damage to growing crops or grass, the verdict of &quot;$ 75 per hole&quot; did not resolve the question of damages sustained. Even if the per hole assessment of damages was supported by the record, the ambiguity in the record concerning the number of holes drilled on the land should have compelled the trial court to order the jury to return to deliberations to resolve the factual question of the number of holes drilled.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the child had been properly taken from them, and that neither parent had complied with the reintegration plan set forth in order for them to get their child back. The court also found that there was evidence of a consistent, long-term pattern of abusive behavior that did not look to stop in the future. This satisfied both prongs of the test set out in Kan.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A detective purchased two magazines from defendant who worked as a clerk. The magazines hanging on a wall depicted individuals engaging in sexual activity. Defendant contended that Kan. Stat.

Defendant also contended that there was insufficient evidence to support her conviction as the facts merely suggested that she was aware of the photographs and the photographs in and of themselves were not obscene. The court held &sect; 21-4301(4) did not violate equal protection because there was a rational basis for the statutory distinction between movie projectionists and bookstore clerks. The court held obscene materials were not protected by the First Amendment and that the State could prohibit the public display and dissemination of obscene materials.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The creditor was granted a writ of possession by the trial court in a foreclosure action against the debtors' property. The debtors appealed, contending that they were denied due process requiring reversal and their rights were prejudiced because the trial court violated the automatic stay provision under the Bankruptcy Act by granting possession of the debtors' property to the creditor. In addition, they claimed that they were not given proper notice of the foreclosure action. On appeal, the court affirmed and ruled that there was no evidence to support the debtors' claim that the automatic stay was violated where the property was not in possession of the debtors at the time of the foreclosure action. Furthermore, the parties conceded in their briefs that the attorney for the creditor advised the trial court that it was the legal titleholder of the property and that the property was not considered part of the bankruptcy estate. The court concluded that the debtors were given considerable notice of the creditor's motion for the foreclosure action and had sufficient time to prepare for the hearing. Thus, the court found no denial of the debtors' due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant employer appealed an order of the Shawnee District Court (Kansas), which affirmed the administrative order of the Secretary of the Department of Human Resources that sustained the claims of claimant employees for withheld commissions and expenses, granting damages and prejudgment interest pursuant to the Kansas Wage Payment Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 44-313 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants were employed as salesmen. The employer's payment plan provided for commissions on a percentage of gross profits. The employer determined that the commissions had been calculated incorrectly due to a computer error that failed to deduct freight expenses. The employer implemented a new payment plan to recoup some of the overpayment of commissions without notifying the employees. Three employees, the claimants, filed claims for the willful nonpayment of earned wages pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-315(a) of the Kansas Wage Payment Act. On appeal, the employer contended that the Secretary's order was entered beyond the 45-day time limit and lacked jurisdiction. The court held that the proscribed time limit in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-322a(d) (Supp. 1985) was directory, not mandatory. The court also held that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-315 was constitutional and that the claimants were entitled to relief. The evidence supported the Secretary's findings. There was ample evidence that the employer knowingly and willfully failed to pay the wages due. The assessment of prejudgment interest was properly applied retroactively under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-323(a).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer challenged the judgment of the District Court of Johnson County (Kansas), which in the insurer's action for a writ of replevin to recover its vehicle, granted appellee towing company a lien for the towing charges and the storage of the automobile. The issue was whether Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 58-201 created a lien for the towing company when the vehicle was removed by the police without the owner's consent or request.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When an automobile was stolen from a dealer in New Mexico, the dealer's insurer paid for the car and received title to it. When the driver of the vehicle was arrested on other charges in Kansas, the police had the vehicle impounded by the towing company. It took two years to trace the owner, the insurer, who refused to pay the bill for storage and towing. The insurer brought an action in replevin to recover the car, but the trial court gave a lien upon the car to the towing company for a towing fee of $ 27.00 and the storage cost of $ 4.00 per day for 660 days, or $ 2,667. On review the court held that the mechanic's or artisan's lien created by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 58-201 did not apply where the owner of the car or its agent did not request or consent to the towing company's services. And the police, in asking for the car to be impounded, could not be considered the owner's agent. Even under the theory of bailment, recognized in some other jurisdictions, there was no lien. Therefore, because there was no contract with the owner or its agent and no statute that created a lien by operation of law, the towing company had no lien on the vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the towing company had no lien on the subject vehicle and reversed the judgment of the trial court that had held the insurer, as its owner, was liable for the towing and storage charges incurred when the vehicle was impounded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of two counts of the sale of marijuana, the prosecutor filed a motion to enhance defendant's sentence under Kan.

The district court invoked &sect; 21-4504 on the first count and sentenced defendant to a minimum of 10 years and a maximum of 20 years; on the second count, the district court sentenced defendant to a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 10 years. Defendant did not appeal his conviction or sentence but subsequently filed a motion for post-conviction relief under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1507. The motion was denied, and defendant appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that defendant alleged no exceptional circumstances for his failure to file a direct appeal. Nevertheless, in addressing the merits of defendant's claim, the court rejected defendant's argument that his sentence was excessively harsh. Defendant was convicted of two felonies and had a history of drug felonies, and the sentence imposed by the district court was well below the maximum authorized given defendant's prior record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that because he had not been given the warning required by Kansas case law about refusing a breath or blood test, the trial court erred in admitting evidence of his refusal to take a breath test. The court stated that the purpose of the warning was to avoid confusion on a defendant's part as to whether he was entitled to counsel in deciding whether he should take the test. It noted that there was no requirement that a defendant be advised of the consequences of the refusal. The court stated that to exclude the refusal would extend the warning beyond its purpose and defeat the legislative intent behind the implied consent law, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1001, which was to coerce a motorist suspected of DUI to consent to testing. Furthermore, the court stated, the record was not clear as to whether defendant had been advised of his Miranda rights; if this fact was not established, it would make the Kansas warning inapplicable. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the jury should have been instructed on disorderly conduct as a lesser &quot;related&quot; offense to obstructing official duty.

The case against defendant was developed through the use of a wiretap. On appeal, defendant contended that the wiretap was not properly ordered because the application had failed to attest to the reliability of the informants for demonstrating probable cause. However, the court noted that the requirement of reliability had been abandoned. Also, the court found that the application for the wiretap and the supporting affidavit amply supported the trial court's conclusion that the requisite probable cause had been shown for the issuance of the wiretap order. Next, the court found that the search warrant had described with sufficient particularity the items to be searched. Finally, the trial court did not err in permitting a federal agent who supervised the wiretapping to testify regarding his interpretation of the tapes. The court noted that the agent was qualified as an expert, and the jury was free to disregard the opinion of the State's expert. The court affirmed defendant's conviction for five drug related offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a mother and her daughter, filed a legal malpractice suit in the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) seeking recovery of damages for breach of contract and negligence against defendant attorney. The attorney had represented the mother in her divorce. The mother and daughter appealed the amount of the damages awarded on the negligence claim and the denial of any recovery for breach of contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother's primary concern in the divorce proceeding was that the attorney secure an agreement from her husband to pay college expenses for their daughter. Although he admitted he was familiar with former Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1610a (Supp. 1980) with respect to agreements for support of children who have reached the age of majority, he relied on the journal entry of judgment without obtaining the father's signature on any document. When the father refused to pay the college expenses, the mother brought suit but did not appeal a decision that the agreement was not enforceable. The court agreed that the attorney performed the contractual duty because the trial court's journal entry could be enforced. The court found, however, that the attorney was liable for negligence because the standard of care normally exercised in the community required a separate signed agreement. The court said that scholarships the daughter received should not have been subtracted in calculating the award but otherwise the amount was correct. The mother could not receive the fee paid the attorney because the father paid it and there was insufficient evidence regarding the daughter's future college expenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in all respects except insofar as the award of damages was reduced in contradiction of the collateral source rule. The court reversed the judgment on the latter point and remanded to the trial court with directions to enter judgment in favor of the daughter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former husband sought review, in two consolidated appeals, of the judgments from Sedgwick County District Court (Kansas) that, in addressing post-divorce motions, found in favor of appellee former wife regarding various issues raised by the husband, including custody, visitation, and support.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In addressing the post-divorce motions, the trial court reinstated the original custody, visitation and support order, increased prospectively the amount of child support, found the husband in direct contempt of court, required the husband to make his payments by money order, denied his motion for change of custody, required him to pay money to appellee former wife, and denied a second custody modification motion. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in reinstating the original visitation order because the motion for rehearing was a timely filed motion to alter or amend pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-259(f), and res judicata did not apply to a case that had not been finally decided on the merits. The court found no substantial competent evidence to support a finding of material change of circumstances, and thus, the order prospectively increasing the amount of child support to be paid by the husband was improper. The evidence supported the trial court's finding that the husband had improperly removed the funds from the account that had been awarded the wife and there was no error in ordering the husband to pay the proceeds from the account to the wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court set aside the order finding the husband in direct contempt, reversed the order increasing the husband's child support payments, dismissed the portion of the appeal regarding the denial of a second custody modification, and affirmed all other orders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Nemaha District Court (Kansas) that convicted him of impairing a security interest, in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3734(1)(b). He claimed error in the jury instruction as to a waiver of rights under a security agreement and in the refusal to allow him to elicit testimony from the county attorney as to his defense of discriminatory prosecution. He also argued that &sect; 21-3734(1)(b) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court instructed the jury that defendant was guilty if they found that he sold cattle, that he knew the cattle were security for a debt owed to a bank, that the security agreement did not authorize such sale, and that the bank did not consent in writing to the sale. Defendant's requested waiver instruction was not given in its entirety. On appeal, defendant argued principles of contract law in contending that the bank had waived any right it might have had to require its written consent for disposal of collateral. In upholding the judgment, the court explained that the requirement of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3734(1)(b), for written consent when a sale of collateral was not authorized by a security agreement, could not be waived so as to excuse criminal conduct. Next, the court found no abuse of discretion in the refusal to allow defendant to elicit testimony to support his claim of discriminatory prosecution. Defendant did not show a colorable entitlement to the defense. Finally, because there was a rational purpose for the classification of borrowers subject to prosecution, the court rejected defendant's claim that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked as a mental health technician for a state hospital under the jurisdiction of SRS. Part of his responsibility was to serve as a role model for the hospital's patients. After the employee was convicted of possession of marijuana, his employment was terminated and the Board affirmed the termination. The employee appealed to the trial court, which affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-2949f(b) (Supp. 1985) permitted termination of a civil service employee who was convicted of a crime and that &sect; 75-2949f(b) was not unconstitutionally vague because the words &quot;crime&quot; and &quot;conviction&quot; were commonly used and understood and thus the statute fairly notified employees that termination for any crime, even a minor one, was a possibility. The court further held that the Board had not acted arbitrarily and capriciously in discharging the employee, finding that there was substantial evidence supporting its conclusion that possession of marijuana was inappropriate conduct for an employee who was to serve as a role model for patients.</SPAN></P>

He argued that his pretrial motion for dismissal was erroneously denied. He contended that the State's preliminary hearing evidence was fatally deficient because it did not established that the charged offenses were committed in the county. The court found that no reversible error as the judge who conducted the preliminary hearing no doubt took judicial notice of the fact that cities were located in the county. Such fact was clearly within the scope of judicial notice permitted to him. The court also found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for new trial as it was not persuaded that defendant's newly discovered evidence would have produced a different trial result. Defendant also contended that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39-720 was unconstitutionally vague. The court disagreed. It was of the opinion that the statute clearly proscribed the obtaining of welfare benefits to which an individual was not entitled by means of false statements or representations made by that person for the purpose of and with the intent to obtain benefits to which he was not entitled. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the statute failed to convey a sufficiently definite warning as to the conduct proscribed because the term instrument was so vague and ambiguous that persons of common intelligence had to guess at its meaning.

On appeal, the court determined that the proper standard for review was the reasonable basis test. In applying the reasonable basis standard, the court found that the classification contained in &sect; 21-4301 did not involve a suspect class. According to defendant, it was constitutionally impermissible for &sect; 21-4301 to treat store clerks differently from projectionists. However, the court found that the classification was acceptable because of the potentially chilling effect the prosecution of projectionists would have had on the showing of constitutionally protected films. Further, projectionists, by the nature of their work, had less of an opportunity to determine whether a film was obscene than did a bookstore clerk, such as defendant, in determining whether a magazine was obscene. Finally, the court found no merit in defendant's due process arguments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas), which convicted him of one count of abuse of a child, pursuant to Kan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant alleged numerous errors in the admission into evidence of child victim hearsay pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-460(dd) and in denial of various motions. Defendant asserted that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-460(dd) on its face violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him. The record showed apparent reliability and trustworthiness of the hearsay declarations admitted by the trial court. The defendant failed to sustain his burden of affirmatively showing that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the victim's out-of-court statements. No violation of defendant's constitutional rights was shown. The trial judge did not act in an arbitrary fashion or unreasonable manner in denying defendant's request for a second evaluation. The record did not support defendant's contention that the purported errors collectively prevented him from receiving a fair trial. Defendant failed to explain how the trial court's refusal to consider his first sentence modification motion substantially prejudiced his rights.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the constitutionality of a statute was presumed and that all doubts were to be resolved in favor of its validity. The court held that the test in determining whether the statute was vague was whether the language conveyed a sufficiently definite warning as to the conduct proscribed when measured by common understanding and practice. The court held that the statute provided notice to defendant that the possession and sale of psilocybin in any form was unlawful. Because the statutes were not unconstitutional, the court held that defendant's convictions were proper. The court affirmed the judgments of the trial courts.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted for violating the municipal ordinance. Defendant contended the municipal ordinance was unconstitutional and violated &sect; 12-3009 et seq. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1909, which was incorporated into the municipal ordinance, was not unconstitutional on equal protection grounds because the classifications used were not wholly irrelevant to the furtherance of safety. The court ruled that the municipal ordinance met the statutory requirements of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-3010 to incorporate a statute. The court held that the municipal ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because a man of ordinary intelligence could readily discern its meaning. The court ruled that the evidence showed that defendant knew there were weight limits and that these limits were codified in statutes or ordinances making it a violation of the law to be overweight.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that he was denied the counsel of his choice at trial because he was not permitted to be represented by lay counsel, that the trial judge erred in failing to remove himself for prejudice, that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a jury of 12 persons, and that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction. The court held that (1) the Sixth Amendment did not create a right to be represented by a non-attorney; (2) the trial court correctly denied defendant's request for a change of judge because the request was not timely made pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20-311f(a) until the day of trial even though defendant knew the identity of the trial judge two or three months before trial; (3) misdemeanor convictions by a unanimous six-person jury, as provided for by Kan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant who had engaged in sexual conduct with his son was convicted of aggravated incest. On review, defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-455 the testimony of his son concerning his previous sexual relationship with defendant. Defendant argued that the rule under &sect; 60-455 applied to the admission of evidence of a prior crime and that his sexual conduct with his son was consensual and not a crime. It was argued that the lewd and lascivious conduct statute&nbsp;Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3508(1)(b) was unconstitutionally overbroad. Because the State relied on the crime of exposure as the unlawful sexual act underlying the incestuous conduct, defendant claimed that he was found guilty simply because he liked to be nude in the privacy of his own home. The court stated that because defendant suggested no reason outside of the policy behind the prior crime rule Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-455 for the evidence to be excluded, his argument that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of the son revealed no error. It could not be said that Kan. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of selling cocaine and selling drug paraphernalia. After defendant appealed, he moved for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. The trial court overruled the motion. Defendant appealed from the order. On the consolidated appeals, the court reversed defendant's conviction on one count of selling paraphernalia. The paraphernalia consisted of a book that was a how-to manual for planting, cultivating, harvesting, and processing marijuana. The court held that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-4153 (Supp. 1984) did not cover a book. It did not purport to prohibit instructions on illicit drugs. The issues raised by defendant with regard to the remaining counts were without merit. The court also held that the newly discovered evidence did not mandate a new trial. The newly discovered evidence was that the agent who testified for the state had been convicted of unlawful deprivation of property and drug violations. The trial court chose to believe that the agent's problems and peculiar behavior developed subsequent to defendant's conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant customer sought review of the decision of the Ford District Court (Kansas), which entered summary judgment in favor of appellees, a city, a security guard and a retailer, on the customer's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 (1982) claim, dismissed the customer's claims for false arrest, defamation, and assault and battery against the city before trial, and which entered a jury verdict for the guard and the retailer on the state law tort claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guard, an off-duty policeman, identified himself as a police officer, told the customer that she was suspected of shoplifting shoes, and stated that she was under arrest. A clerk confirmed that the shoes were not stolen. The customer filed a &sect; 1983 claim and various tort claims against appellees. The trial court entered a judgment for appellees. The court held that the guard was not entitled to summary judgment on the &sect; 1983 claim because whether he had probable cause for the arrest was an unresolved factual issue, and arrest without probable cause was grounds for a &sect; 1983 claim. However, summary judgment for the city and the retailer on the &sect; 1983 claim was proper because the record neither contained anything to support the existence of a city custom or policy of making arrests without probable cause nor indicated that the retailer authorized illegal actions. Moreover, the Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3424(3) merchant's privilege did not apply to acts done in the performance of any duty by a law enforcement officer. Finally, under the doctrine of respondeat superior, the retailer was liable, as the guard's employer, for his tortious acts committed within the scope of employment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision as to the tort claims that were in favor of the retailer and the guard and as to the summary judgment on the civil rights claim that was in favor of the guard. The trial court's decision was affirmed in all other respects. The case was remanded for trial of the civil rights claim against the guard and for retrial of the tort claims against the guard and the retailer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In March and April 1981, the taxpayer relocated to Wynadotte County and purchased certain personal property. After the taxpayer supplied the county appraiser with a list of personalty that included the equipment, the appraiser assessed it and issued the taxpayer a notice that it owed ad valorem taxes with respect to the property. The taxpayer paid under protest and sought a refund. The court affirmed a trial court determination that the Board erred in rejecting the taxpayer's claim. Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-316 did not apply to require the imposition of tax on personal property that the taxpayer did not own on Tax Day simply because the taxpayer moved into the county after Tax Day and before July 1. Such a move between counties was not a significant taxable event and did not make taxable what was not taxable under the general law. The contrary interpretation reached by the Board would result in discrimination between businessmen who purchased equipment within the county and those who purchased from a source in another county or outside the state, and between those who moved into a county before Tax Day and those who moved after Tax Day, none of which was intended by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

He admitted that he did not believe defendant was in a medical emergency and thought only that she was drunk. When the officer went through a bank bag, he found a smaller purse in which he found drugs and drug paraphernalia. Defendant was arrested and charged with possession of cocaine and possession of marijuana. The trial court found that the warrantless search of the bank bag was illegal under the U.S. and Kansas Constitutions, and that the seized fruits of the search were inadmissible. It therefore ordered suppression of all physical evidence seized and of defendant's pretrial statements. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court noted that the officer conceded at the preliminary hearing that when he searched the bank bag he knew defendant was not medically endangered. The record supported the court's findings that there were no exigent circumstances that would have justified the officer's search. He did not have probable cause to believe defendant's vehicle or its contents contained contraband, so the mobility exception did not apply either.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the statute did not violate defendant's rights under the Sixth Amendment because the trial judge found, after a hearing, that the child was unavailable and that the statement was reliable.

The court determined that the statute created no classifications and that defendant made no claim that the statute was selectively enforced.

The court affirmed the judgment, finding that defendant waived the issue because under Kan. Stat.

Further, due process of law was not per se infringed when a preliminary examination was conducted by a nonlawyer judge. Denial of defendant's motion for a mistrial was not an abuse of discretion because the declaration of a mistrial was a matter entrusted to the discretion of the trial court. Additionally, a mistrial was not required when there was no proof of prejudice. Defendant further contended that there was insufficient evidence of intent to kill. The court determined that evidence of the force and location of defendant's kicks inflicted on his victim was sufficient for the jury to infer intent to kill. Finally, the court determined that the trial court's instruction did not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof. It established only a permissive presumption.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed their convictions on appeal. The court determined that defendants had not raised the defense of discriminatory and selective law enforcement in a pretrial motion as required by Kan. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order of the Geary County District Court (Kansas), which convicted him of indecent liberties with a child, in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3503 (Supp. 1983), and sentenced him to 4 to 15 years in prison. Defendant's main contention was that Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been dating the child's mother and had been alone with the child at various times. The child did not testify at the trial or the preliminary hearing. The court held that &sect; 60-460(dd) was not unconstitutional on its face because it required a determination that the child was unavailable and that her statements were apparently reliable. The court noted that defendant stipulated at trial that the child was disqualified as a witness, but claimed that her statements were unreliable. In the court's view, the child's statements were admissible under either &sect; 60-460(d)(3) or (dd) because the child was given a psychological examination to determine the reliability of her statements. Further, a child psychiatrist testified that she knew the difference between right and wrong and that he considered her statements to be reliable. In addition, medical evidence showed that she contracted gonorrhea not long after defendant contracted the disease. The court opined that the evidence was sufficient to establish venue in the county where defendant was charged, and that his sentence was within the statutory limits.</SPAN></P>

The court also upheld the admission of a statement made by defendant to the polygraph examiner. Although polygraph results were not admissible, her confession during the pretest interview was. Although defendant argued on appeal that her statements were taken out of context and were hearsay, she failed to raise those arguments at trial as required by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-404.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer constructed drilling rigs for use by the companies that commissioned their construction. The products were not for resale. The taxpayer protested the assessment, which was upheld. The Board affirmed. The taxpayer filed a request for rehearing, which was denied. The taxpayer appealed. In affirming, the court rejected the construction of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3603(q) (1983) advanced by the taxpayer. The second sentence of &sect; 79-3603(q) was not meant to serve as a limitation on the first sentence. Rather, the legislative intent was to clearly include the services of repairing, servicing, altering, or maintaining fixtures within the sphere of taxability. The taxpayer's claim that the services he performed were such that his finished products amounted to original construction, which was exempt under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3603(p), was without merit. The court held that as used in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3603(q), &quot;altering&quot; meant changing in some form so as to affect some details, characteristics, or elements of the thing changed without destroying its identity. The court found that the taxpayer merely altered the angle iron as all he did was rearrange its spatial arrangement.</SPAN></P>

The court held that in order to convict under &sect; 65-4155, the State had to prove that there was a knowing delivery of a substance, but that proof of knowledge that the delivered substance was not a controlled substance or proof of specific intent to deliver a noncontrolled substance was not required. The fact that defendant did not know the substance was noncontrolled or may have in good faith believed the substance to be a controlled substance, was not a defense.

The officer gave him several field sobriety tests, which he failed. Defendant was handcuffed and placed in the patrol car.

He also found two clear plastic bags containing marijuana in the space between the seat and the driver's side door. He found empty wine bottles in the back seat and more marijuana in the trunk and glove compartment. The trial court suppressed the evidence on the ground that the search did not satisfy the warrant exception for being incident to a lawful arrest because defendant was already handcuffed and in the police car. As such, he was not a threat to the officer. The court held that the evidence was admissible. Under controlling case law, even though defendant had been placed in the patrol car, the search of the passenger compartment of his vehicle was incident to a lawful arrest. Upon finding contraband in the passenger compartment, the officer had probable cause to believe the vehicle contained other contraband and to search the trunk and glove compartment.</SPAN></P>

Further, there was substantial evidence to support the KCC order authorizing the applicant to charge the intervenor for use of the wire because the intervenor was clearly a user of the wire and a customer's use of the wire did not preclude a finding that the intervenor also used the wire.

The court held that &sect; 8-1567(a) was not void for vagueness because the phrase &quot;under the influence of alcohol&quot; was commonly understood. The court ruled that the &quot;third offender&quot; provision in &sect; 8-1567(e), which excluded DUI convictions from other states, did not violate the equal protection clause. The court held that the fact that defendant was convicted of DUI at a time when the law did not impose mandatory penalties for repeat offenders did not render &sect; 8-1567(e) an ex post facto law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas), which convicted him of aggravated battery and which denied defendant's motion for acquittal and/or a new trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, and the constitutionality of the aggravated battery statute,&nbsp;Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3414. On appeal, the court found that the trial court correctly overruled defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal as sufficient evidence was presented to the jury to sustain its verdict. Defendant struck and kicked the victim and photographs of the victim immediately after the assault clearly showed that the victim was severely beaten. The victim's injuries were not merely bruises typically sustained in a simple battery. The court also concluded that &sect; 21-3414 was not unconstitutionally vague. The word &quot;great&quot; distinguished the bodily harm necessary in aggravated battery from slight, trivial, minor or moderate harm that was likely to be sustained in a simple battery. The language of &sect; 21-3414 was readily understandable, and the elements were simple and within common understanding and practice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted. He appealed, alleging that he was erroneously convicted, that the search of the car where the firearm was found was unconstitutional, that the search, even if lawful when begun, became unlawful when it became excessive in intensity and scope, and that the evidence was insufficient to support the judgment. In affirming, the court held that defendant was not erroneously convicted because a defendant stood convicted of a felony, which made the possession unlawful, within the meaning of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4204(1)(b), during the pendency of his appeal. The search of defendant's car was lawful, pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-2401(c)(1), as the facts were sufficient to support a determination of the arresting officers that defendant was involved in the commission of a felony. The search did not become unlawful, as defendant contended, because inasmuch as the gun was found under the seat of the car rather than underneath the car itself, the search was not excessive in intensity or scope, as determined by case law. Finally, because the intent to possess a firearm could be shown by circumstantial evidence, the evidence was sufficient to uphold the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and appealed. In affirming, the court held that defendant's contention that the district court erred in permitting an expert opinion to be expressed by an employee of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation (KBI) was without merit pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-456 because while it was true that the employee did not state with particularity regarding special training, he did testify to a higher education in chemistry, numerous courses, his employment, and the number of drug tests he had performed. Defendant's contention that the evidence was not sufficient to support his conviction was without merit because the district court had examined each element and found abundant evidence to support the convictions. The instructions to the jury were upheld because the giving of an instruction that the jury should not have found defendant guilty on circumstantial evidence alone unless the facts and circumstances excluded every reasonable theory of innocence need not have been given, no reversible error accrued. An instruction given properly contained a number of direct statements that clearly communicated that the burden of proof never shifted to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first noted that the owners were paid the entire amount of their loss by their insurer and were not the real parties in interest.

The owners argued that summary judgment was inappropriate because there was an issue of fact as to the extent of damage to the building and its contents. The owners claimed that the building and some of its contents were still salvageable at that point, and so the declaration and subsequent demolition were improper. The owners essentially argued that the city officials were negligent in that they too hastily condemned the property. The city argued that it was insulated from liability by virtue an exception to liability under the Kansas Tort Claims Act, which insulated the city from liability failure to provide police or fire protection. Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-6104(m) (1982 Supp.). The court held that the act of alleged negligence, that of inspecting the property and declaring same an immediate hazard to public safety, was in fact an act of providing police or fire protection and that the city was immune from liability under &sect; 75-6104(m).</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3603(p) (Supp. 1982).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the State contended that the taxpayer's services in drilling gas storage and salt water disposal wells were outside the exclusion from sales taxation provided by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3603(p) (Supp. 1982). The court noted that, after imposing a general sales tax, &sect; 79-3603(p) provided the limitation that no tax was to be imposed upon the service of installing or applying tangible personal property in connection with the original construction of a building or facility, and that &quot;facility&quot; included a oil or gas well and water well. Although there was little legislative history for &sect; 79-3603(p), when the section was considered with a companion provision, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3606(n) (Supp. 1982), a general legislative intent to exclude from sales taxation activities relating to oil, gas, and water production, among others, was clearly demonstrated. There also was a clear motive on the part of the legislature to promote real estate and mineral development generally. Moreover, nothing on the face of the statute showed any indication to limit the definition of gas or water wells to those from which the extraction of gas or water was sought.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the complaint was duplicitous, that a change of judge should have been granted, that there was error in the jury instructions, that a witness should not have testified as an expert, that evidence should not have been admitted, and that the docket fee was incorrect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and her friends went on a vandalism spree at a golf course. Defendant was charged with damage in excess of $ 100, a felony. Defendant contended that the judge was biased because he had interests in the golf course. Defendant was charged the cost of the felony docket fee rather then the misdemeanor fee. The court affirmed except on the fee issue. The complaint was not duplicitous by referring to several acts because the acts were a part of one criminal activity under the &quot;single impulse rule.&quot; Moreover, defendant's challenge to the complaint came to late when it was made at trial. The change of judge was properly denied because the affidavit of prejudice was too late. The instructions on aiding and abetting were proper because the evidence supported them. A witness was a sufficient expert on trees to qualify as an expert on the damage to a tree. A bill of damages to a golf cart was hearsay, but the error was harmless because there was other evidence of damage. Defendant should have paid the misdemeanor fee because the key for setting the fee was when she was convicted, not charged. Further, the new fee under Kan. Stat.

The court also held that the State's failure to show that the portable scales on which defendant's truck was weighed were within ten miles of permanent, certified scales, as required by Kan. Stat.

Ann. &sect; 65-1643(a) (Supp. 1982), for operating a pharmacy without a permit. That decision was appealed to the district court, which affirmed. Because the owner continued to operate the business under the same name, the Board brought the instant action. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that &quot;Farmacy&quot; was a word of similar import to pharmacy and created confusion for the public. Because of the deceptive name, the court held that the owner had to be registered as a pharmacy or be in violation of &sect; 65-1643(a).

On appeal, the court held that the legislature did not intend the maximum fine for an overweight violation under &sect; 8-1901(c) to be limited by the maximum fine for a class A misdemeanor. The court held that the trial court correctly applied the fine schedule in &sect; 8-1901(c) by multiplying the rate of fine applicable to the entire gross overweight poundage without first applying the lesser rate of fine figures in increments to the first 7,500 pounds of gross overweight. Nor was the amount of the fine an abuse of the discretion conferred upon the trial court by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4607(3). Based on precedent, the court held that the mandatory fine schedule in &sect; 8-1901(c) was not unconstitutional. Nor was the schedule a legislative encroachment on the judicial sentencing functions in violation of the separation of powers doctrine. The court held that the fine was not so disproportionate to the crime as to shock the conscience of the court such that it was an excessive fine prohibited by Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 9.

This conviction was defendant's second such conviction for possession of marijuana, the offense was enhanced from a Class A misdemeanor to a Class D felony pursuant to Kan. Stat.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-4127b(a), which elevates a second time conviction for possession of marijuana to a felony, is constitutional. Affirming the conviction, the court stated that the trial court did not err by admitting into evidence the marijuana that was seized from defendant's pickup truck. The facts presented in the case clearly fall within the plain view doctrine. The initial intrusion which afforded the officers plain view was lawful; the discovery of the evidence was inadvertent; and, the incriminating nature of the evidence was immediately apparent. The court stated that self-contained specific recidivist statutes, such as Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were cited for driving concrete pump/boom trucks that lacked any vehicle registrations.

The court only upheld the portion of the judgment against one defendant who received a citation for driving a concrete pump on a Sunday, a violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-128(b) (Supp. 1981). The court found that defendants' concrete pumps qualified as a &quot;self-propelled crane&quot; described in &sect; 8-128(b). Consequently, the concrete pumps were exempt from the motor vehicle registration requirement in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-127 (Supp. 1981). The court decided that the concrete pumps did not constitute &quot;road machinery.&quot; The district court correctly found that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-128 (Supp. 1981) was not vague. The court ruled that the language of &sect; 8-128 was not so indefinite as to render it unconstitutionally void. The court rejected as meritless defendants' asserted defense of mistake of law under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3203(2) (Supp. 1973).

Any resident who did not want to receive the paper could request that the paper not be thrown to him any more. Defendant was convicted of violating an ordinance that made it unlawful to throw refuse of any kind on private property except with the consent of the owner or occupant. The parties agreed that the paper was a form of speech and that defendant, in printing and distributing the paper, enjoyed First Amendment protection. Defendant also argued that the ordinance restricted content because the judgment of the individual householder as to whether to accept the publication was necessarily based on content, and that content restrictions were clearly unconstitutional. The court, however, held that the ordinance itself was neutral in content. Furthermore, the court found no reason crucial to defendant's First Amendment rights that required a householder to retrieve an unwanted paper from his lawn and dispose of it, no matter how aggravating to him, rather than requiring defendant to respect the householder's prior request to stop throwing the paper on his lawn.</SPAN></P>

Although it was not clear which rule would prevail, the non-exhaustion rule or the exhaustion rule with qualifications, it did not matter. The crux of the teacher's action was that the board could not render an impartial decision under the statutory grievance procedure and violated his due process rights. The adequacy of the teacher's administrative remedy was essentially identical to the merits of his lawsuit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consumer filed an action for a deceptive consumer sales practice. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the consumer and the leasing company appealed. The consumer cross-appealed with regard to its attorney fees award. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that the consumer was aggrieved by the leasing company's violation of the Act. The court found that the evidence established that the car the consumer purchased needed a paint job and that the statute authorized the recovery of actual damages or a civil penalty to be established by the court. Therefore, the court concluded that the trial court properly imposed a civil penalty in the case. In reference to the attorney fees award, the court rejected the leasing company's argument that there was insufficient evidence to support the award. The court noted that &sect;&sect; 50-634(e), 50-636(a) gave the trial court discretion to award attorney fees and found that the record showed the consumer's attorneys introduced an itemized bill covering their fees. The court stated that the trial court was in a better position to decide attorney fees and that it could not determine whether the trial court abused its discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The camper was staying at a state park with his family and friends. The park was situated on land that the United States Army Corps of Engineers leased to the Authority. The camper was swimming in an area of a lake that was not designated a swimming area, but there were no signs. He struck an object when he dove into the water and broke his neck. He filed an action against the Authority alleging negligence and breach of contract as a third-party beneficiary of the lease agreement between the Authority and the Corps of Engineers. The trial court sustained the Authority's motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the action was barred by governmental immunity under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46-901. The court held that &sect; 46-901 was constitutional and barred the camper's action. The failure to erect a sign in the area where the camper was injured was a violation of duty imposed by law independent of the contract between the Authority and the Corps of Engineers. The camper's action sounded in tort, and he had no cause of action under the contract theory. The Kansas Tort Claims Act did not abrogate all immunity formerly afforded under Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to defendant's trial on a charge of indecent liberties with a child, the trial court ruled that evidence of other alleged acts of misconduct would not be admitted because it would have a prejudicial effect far outweighing any relevance to the charge. The court dismissed the State's interlocutory appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The court noted that if it had jurisdiction, it had to be under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3603 (1979 Supp.). The court held that an order excluding other crimes evidence was not an order &quot;suppressing evidence&quot; so as to authorize an interlocutory appeal under &sect; 22-3603. This was the type of discretionary ruling made regularly in the course of every trial. No constitutional rights were involved and no deterrent effect was sought. The court held that &sect; 22-3603 was meant to deal with important evidentiary rulings on issues having constitutional dimensions and not to allow interlocutory appeal from every run-of-the mill evidentiary ruling against the State, even though made before trial.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that a chiropractor could not administer or prescribe &quot;medicine or drugs in materia medica.&quot; The chiropractor contended that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and unenforceable. The court found that the term materia medica was synonymous with drugs or medicine and neither limited nor expanded the scope of lawful chiropractic practice. As such, the term was surplusage that could be omitted without doing violence to the intent of the legislature. Therefore, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague or indefinite. The chiropractor also claimed that he was denied procedural due process. The court found that the chiropractor was given effective notice of the hearing and was represented by counsel.The court noted that the revocation order was within the statutory authority of the Board and the revocation of the chiropractor's license did not appear to be fraudulent, arbitrary, or capricious.</SPAN></P>

Prior to the action for divorce, the husband had been adjudicated an incapacitated person. The trial court dismissed the husband's petition for divorce without prejudice on the ground that he had been adjudicated an incapacitated person, and therefore lacked legal capacity to file the action. On appeal, the court held that the issue was whether the trial court erred by concluding that the finding of incapacity was res judicata and conclusive as to capacity in the subsequent divorce proceedings. The court concluded that the only way that the husband's capacity to sue could have been questioned was in a proceeding for restoration to capacity. As a result, the court held that the judgment rendered under the provisions of the probate code, that the husband was an incapacitated person requiring a guardian and conservator, was conclusive and binding on the trial court in the divorce action. Therefore, the court concluded that the trial court properly determined that the husband lacked the requisite capacity to file suit for divorce in his own name.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did not erroneously deny a mistrial upon the prosecution's elicitation from defendant's wife that at the time of trial the victim and the wife's other two children were residing with an aunt under a temporary custody order entered in a juvenile proceeding because it was speculative that the testimony improperly and prejudicially advised the jury of a prior judicial decision and resolution of a matter. The words &quot;fondling&quot; and &quot;touching&quot; as used in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3503(1)(b) (Sup. 1979) were not plural and did not require repetitious actions of more than one touch. While &sect; 21-3503(1)(b) required there be proof of intent to arouse or satisfy sexual desire, proof of actual arousal or satisfaction of sexual desire was not required, and intent could be shown by circumstantial evidence.

The trial court rejected defendant's claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because the recoupment statute,&nbsp;Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-4513 (Supp. 1979), was unconstitutional. The court held that although &sect; 22-4513 could not be used to collect a judgment rendered pursuant to that statute, it did not mean that counsel once appointed was ineffective per se. The court also held that defendant had appointed counsel, so his right to have counsel appointed was not violated. The court ruled that defendant failed to raise the issue of effective assistance of counsel at the trial level. The mere fact that counsel was limited to a certain fee, the court stated, was not sufficient to show ineffective assistance of counsel. The court decided that it was to be presumed that the jury understood what the words &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; meant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimed that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury as to the effect of its allocation of fault on the award of damages. When the case was tried, it was recommended that the jury be instructed on the legal consequences of its answers in a comparative negligence case, but no appellate decision in the state had endorsed the instruction. About two months after the case was tried, the Supreme Court of Kansas held that giving Kan. Pattern Instructions Civ. No. 20.01 was the better rule and that it was not error in a comparative negligence action under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-258a for the trial court to inform the jury as to the legal effect of its special verdicts in the form of a general instruction advising the jury of the theory and legal effect of comparative negligence. However, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment because there was ample justification for its decision at the time the decision was made and because the newly announced rule was not to be applied retroactively to a case such as this that had gone to judgment before the rule was announced.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State was allowed to endorse five additional witnesses over defendant's objections. On review the court found no error. The court noted that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3405 had been previously found to be constitutional and not vague or indefinite. The court also noted that because ordinary negligence was any deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe under the same circumstance, it followed that a material deviation would be negligence that exceeded ordinary negligence. The trial court was vested with wide discretion in receiving opinion evidence and did not abuse that discretion in allowing expert testimony as to the speed of the cars. Under the circumstances of the case it was not error for the trial court to permit the accident reconstruction witness to give evidence as to the estimated speed of defendant's vehicle. The right of the State to endorse additional witness lay in the sound discretion of the trial court and its ruling was not disturbed absent a showing of abuse of discretion.

The court reversed the decision of the district court. The court held that the foremost rule of statutory construction was that the intent of the legislature governed. However, the ambiguities of the terms of the statute made it impossible to determine with any reasonable degree of certainty what the legislature intended. Further, defendant's conviction could not be intelligently reviewed because the exception clause of the statute was so vague that it could not be administered by the courts. What the intended meaning of &sect; 8-136(a) might be the court could only speculate, as no guide was provided within the act. The statute used terms so vague that persons of common intelligence had to necessarily guess at its meaning and differed as to its application. It therefore violated the first essential of due process of law and was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Seven weeks after reversal, the State commenced a second prosecution against the inmate again charging him with aggravated indecent solicitation of a child under Kan. Stat.

Defendant argued, among other things, that the district judge was guilty of misconduct based on various statements made throughout the trial. The court held that the judge's admonitions to defendant's attorney amounted to no more than his attempts to keep the attorney's conduct under control. The court held that although the judge could have chosen his words more carefully, the remarks did not amount to judicial misconduct. The court further held that the judge's comments during sentencing regarding his disbelief of defendant also did not constitute judicial misconduct. The court reasoned that the statements were made outside the presence of the jury and therefore defendant's argument that the judge had a duty not to influence the jury was inapplicable. The court determined that the district court did not abuse its discretion in permitting a police officer to testify as an expert concerning the alteration of serial numbers on motorcycles. The court noted that defendant failed to show that his rights were substantially prejudiced by the testimony.</SPAN></P>

Finally, the court held that &sect; 44-510f(c) (Supp. 1974) was constitutional while in effect and did not deprive the claimant of his constitutional rights.

The court disagreed and held that the father had not been authorized to reduce his payments without court approval.

This followed incident where the patient had threatened her mother and other relatives. The court agreed with the patient that K.S.A. &sect; 59-2902(1) (Supp. 1977) required a finding that a proposed patient for involuntary commitment be presently dangerous to herself or to others, but rejected the contention that the evidence in the case was inadequate to support such a finding. Federal decisions and others states had showed an increasing concern for the protection of the rights of the mentally ill and had indicated additional standards and procedural requirements to be followed. The court concluded that a finding that a mentally ill person be found a danger to self or others was necessary before commitment. Evidence that the patient had threatened her mother and had also hit her younger brothers, in conjunction with evidence of other bizarre behavior and medical testimony supported a finding that the patient was dangerous to others.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On July 3, 1974, the employee was fatally injured as a result of an accident at work.

The examiner computed the compensation payable by including a setoff for social security death benefits pursuant to &sect; 44-510b(j). The award was approved on administrative review and on appeal to the trial court. The Kansas legislature repealed &sect; 44-510b(j), effective July 1, 1977. On appeal, the court held that: (1) an amendment to the Workmen's Compensation Act or a repeal of a part of the Act, which was procedural or remedial in nature, and which did not prejudicially affect the substantive rights of the parties, applied to pending cases; (2) the amount of compensation payable to a workmen's compensation claimant was a matter of substance rather than procedure; and (3) the setoff directed by &sect; 44-510b(j) was applicable to compensation payments due after the provision's repeal where the repeal constituted a change in the amount of compensation due to certain dependents of a deceased workman and thus was substantive, not remedial, in nature.</SPAN></P>

Trial counsel sought to show in cross-examination that the confession was involuntary and the result of psychological pressure. Defendant claimed that more should have been done to determine the voluntariness of the confession. The court held that even though a hearing to determine the voluntariness of the confession was not requested, law demanded that there nevertheless be one. The lack of an objection would only be considered a waiver if it were shown that it was knowing and intelligent, and because trial counsel inquired on voluntariness on cross-examination there was no waiver.

Pursuant to a stipulation the parties agreed that the city was to order an audit and a verification of expenditures, only attorney fees would be awarded to the electors, and the Board of Tax Appeals was to issue no-fund warrants to cover costs and expenses of litigation. The Board of Tax Appeals denied the application to issue the no-fund warrants. The court held that the trial court properly modified the mandamus order regarding the Board of Tax Appeals' approval, because the understanding had been that the Board would issue the warrants as a matter of routine, which was a mistaken belief. The provisions of &sect; 75-1125 were mandatory and the Board had no authority to relieve the city of its statutory duty.

On appeal, the court held that because the board was an administrative body, the candidate had no right of appeal except by statute. Because ch. 138, &sect; 20(f) dealt specifically with proceedings involving elections while Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-2101(d) dealt with appeals from administrative agencies generally, 1978 Kan. Sess. Laws ch. 138, &sect; 20(f) governed the candidate's action, which was in the nature of an appeal of the board's decision. Because the candidate's action was not filed not less than 30 days before the general election, it was untimely under ch. 138, &sect; 20(f), which was a statute of limitations, not a jurisdictional statute. Because the title to 1978 Kan. Sess. Laws ch. 138 included a reference to amending Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 25-308, and because &sect; 25-308 had the same provision as 1978 Kan. Sess.

The court further found that his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself had not been violated because the grant of immunity by the State of Kansas was binding not only in Kansas, but in federal and other state courts as well. Defendant also argued that the inquisition was in violation of his plea agreement. The court looked behind the announced plea bargain to the entire record. It found that the State had admitted that it had agreed not to request defendant to voluntarily or involuntarily testify against other co-defendants as long as he was in still in the penal system.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile appealed a judgment from the Lyon District Court (Kansas), which adjudicated him delinquent for assisting in the commission of rape and for burglary under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 21-3502, 21-3205, and 21.3716. Defendant alleged that the Kansas rape shield law, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-447a, violated his rights under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Kan. Bill Rights &sect; 10 of confrontation and to present witnesses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had sexual intercourse with his victim and by force assisted two other men to have sexual intercourse with the victim, and defendant was convicted as a result. On appeal, the court held that because defendant's rights to cross-examine and to present witnesses under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 10 were subject to the relevancy requirement of admissibility of evidence, because Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-447a required only that defendant prove the relevancy of his victim's prior sexual conduct at a pre-trial hearing before the victim's prior sexual conduct could be admitted, and because the State had a strong interest in protecting the victim from unnecessary embarrassment, &sect; 60-447a was constitutional. Because defendant admitted that he and his companions had sexual intercourse with the victim, the victim's prior sexual relationship with defendant was irrelevant on the rape charge. However, because burglary was a specific intent offense and was not mentioned in &sect; 60-447a as a presumptively irrelevant offense, the evidence of the victim's prior sexual conduct should have been admitted to disprove the element of intent on the burglary charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment convicting defendant of assisting in the commission of a rape but reversed the judgment convicting defendant of burglary.

The director affirmed the denial, the employee appealed to the district court, and he filed the separate action in negligence, which was consolidated with the appeal.

The court held that: (1) the trial court did not adequately distinguish between complaints that were peculiar to a particular inmate and those that were common to all inmates; (2) where an inmate of a jail or correctional institution challenged the conditions of his confinement but did not challenge the fact or duration of that confinement, relief could be sought by way of injunction or declaratory judgment as well as by habeas corpus; (3) under the circumstances, the inmates had no available, effective administrative remedy to exhaust; (4) issues common to all inmates could be decided in a class action; and (5) other members of the class could have represented the class adequately.</SPAN></P>

On the death of a joint tenant, the property descended to the survivor and the right of survivorship terminated only when the entire estate came into the hands of the last survivor. Thus, each joint tenant had a vested identical interest. The effect of the death of one of two joint tenants was that the survivor &quot;took&quot; the interest of the deceased and the resulting interests of the survivor were freed from participation of the deceased. The result of proper statutory construction was that a surviving joint tenant who was convicted of the felonious killing of the other joint tenant succeeded to an undivided one-half interest in the property. The loss of the wife of her vested interest was not imposed as a penalty for the murder under the penal statutes, and such a forfeiture would have contravened &sect; 12 of the Bill of Rights.</SPAN></P>

In reversing and remanding for a new trial, the court found that the hairstylist and beauty shop were denied due process of law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county government and cross-appellant hospital each challenged the judgment of the District Court of Crawford County (Kansas), in an action brought by the hospital against the county for payment of medical services provided to an indigent prisoner. The issued included whether the county was liable for the prisoner's injuries incurred after he had escaped and whether the county could be found liable based on negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A prisoner escaped from jail out of a fourth-story window, falling to the parking lot where he broke his leg. He was recaptured in the parking lot and taken to the hospital where he was hospitalized for over a month followed by months of aftercare. The county refused to pay the bill and the hospital filed an action to collect. The trial court held that the county was not statutorily liable to pay for the prisoner's medical care because the injuries were incurred while he was not in the custody of the sheriff; that is, after he had escaped. Yet the trial court did impose liability holding that the sheriff was negligent in letting the prisoner escape. When both parties sought review, the court held that the sheriff and the county could not be liable in negligence due to sovereign immunity. The court also held that the prisoner was injured after he had escaped. However, the court held that the sheriff had an affirmative duty to recapture the prisoner, which he did, and at that moment reacquired his statutory duty to provide for and to pay for the prisoner's medical care. Because the trial court rendered the right decision, even though for the wrong reason, its judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court on behalf of the hospital that held that the county was financially responsible for the indigent prisoner's medical care.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged their convictions by the Shawnee District Court (Kansas) for promoting obscenity, in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4301 (Supp. 1973).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions arose out of defendants' operation of a bookstore. Plainclothes detectives made a series of buys from the store and the materials purchased were presented to a trial court in an application for a search warrant. Officers executing the warrant seized publications thought to be obscene. Defendants sought to dismiss the indictment based on the alleged unconstitutionality of the statute under which they were charged, alleging that the statute was overbroad and too vague to support a conviction. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded with directions to discharge defendants. At the time that defendants' conduct occurred, the Kansas obscenity statute was unconstitutionally broad and defendants could not be convicted under it consistent with due process. The statute did not meet the specificity requirements set by the United States Supreme Court. The court found that defendants had standing to challenge the statute that purported to regulate rights of speech or press protected by the First Amendment even though the statute may not be vague or overbroad as applied to defendant's own conduct.</SPAN></P>
