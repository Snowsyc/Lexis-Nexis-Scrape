</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both parties appealed a decree from the Circuit Court for St. Mary's County (Maryland), which enjoined appellee Board of County Commissioners of St. Mary's County (board) from collecting a benefit tax against appellant couple's lots, and which authorized the board to collect an ad valorem tax against the lots.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board charged the taxes against the couple's property as part of an erosion prevention project. After the board tried to collect the taxes, the couple filed a suit against the board to enjoin the collection of the taxes. When the circuit court enjoined the board from collecting the benefit tax, the board appealed. The couple appealed the decree authorizing the board to collect ad valorem tax against the lots. The court modified the decree to the extent that, if the board acquired the couple's seawall, the board could collect the benefit tax. The decree had perpetually enjoined the board from collecting the benefit tax on the lots. If the board acquired an easement in or ownership of the seawall, no just reason prevented the board from collecting the tax. The court also modified the decree to remove a condition on the decree that the lots had to be brought into the taxing district and remanded. The chancellor erred in conditioning the decree on the requirement that the two lots had to be brought into the taxing district. The court could not say that excluding the lots was manifestly arbitrary or unreasonable. The court affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

As modified, the court affirmed the decree.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trustee was appointed pursuant to Acts of 1929, ch. 518, &sect; 135 after the chancellor decreed that the ward was incompetent and incapable of managing his property or estate. The trustee administered the estate for more than two years and then sought to sell certain real property belonging to the ward. He filed a petition pursuant to &sect; 140 that contained the customary allegations, and a tentative contract of sale for the property, subject to the chancellor's approval. No summons was requested nor issued notifying the ward of the proposed sale. Proof was taken as to the value, quantity, and condition of the property and other surrounding circumstances. The chancellor found that the sale would be to the interest and advantage of the ward, but refused to ratify the sale on the ground, inter alia, that no notice was given the ward that the trustee intended to sell the property. The court found, however that &sect; 137 specifically provided that such sales could be made without any process or order of publication in order to avoid unnecessary delay and useless expense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On three occasions, police tapped telephone wires to a house in which there were two telephones listed to different persons where they overheard calls concerning bets on horse races. The police executed a search of the residence under a warrant based upon the conversations intercepted by the wiretap and found defendants in a rear bedroom on the second floor of the house with evidence of a large and well organized bookmaking operation. Several calls came in while the police were there from persons attempting to place bets. Defendants' motion to quash the warrants and suppress the evidence was overruled. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that as neither phone was listed in defendants' names, there was no evidence that either was talking on the telephone at any time when police heard conversations as to bets on horse races and, the only names overheard in the conversations were those other than defendants, defendants had no standing to object to the introduction of evidence seized in the raid on the ground that the warrant was based on evidence deemed inadmissible under Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner petitioned to change the zoning from residential to &quot;manufacturing, restricted&quot; in order to construct a weapons parts factory. The zoning appeals board upheld the zoning commissioner's approval of the petition, and the taxpayers appealed from the circuit court judgment affirming that decision. The court held that Baltimore County, Md., Zoning Reg. &sect; 250 (1955), which established the &quot;manufacturing, restricted&quot; zoning classification, was part of a comprehensive plan of county development and constituted a proper delegation of power to the planning commission, the zoning commissioner, and the zoning appeals board to grant the petitions. The zoning commission made a prior legislative determination that the zoning classification would be appropriate upon the agencies' application of enumerated standards, and the agencies' actions were not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. Further, the commissioner's consideration of the petition for rezoning was not improper spot zoning; it did not classify the land for an application that was inconsistent with the rest of the area or that was for the sole benefit of the property owner. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 369 (1951), both as second offenses due to a prior conviction in Pennsylvania for possessing and administering a narcotic.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was convicted in Pennsylvania for possessing and administering a narcotic. The inmate was then convicted by the criminal court for unlawful possession and control of a narcotic. The criminal court sentenced the inmate as a second offender under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 369 (1951) because of the Pennsylvania conviction. The inmate unsuccessfully sought a writ of habeas corpus, claiming double jeopardy and violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The inmate sought leave to appeal, but the court affirmed the criminal court. The court noted that, pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 369 (1951), the penalty for committing the charged offenses the first time was a fine and imprisonment for two to five years while the penalty for committing the charged offenses a second time was a larger fine and imprisonment for 5 to 10 years. It did not matter that Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 369 (1951) was passed after the inmate committed the first offense, the court said, as the statute enhanced the penalty for an offense rather than created a new offense to punish a previously convicted person. Also, double jeopardy was not a habeas corpus issue, the court said.</SPAN></P>

Defendant stipulated that he did not have a license to practice medicine, but claimed he was not required to have a license under an English law applying to natural healers that he claimed had been in effect on July 4, 1776, and continued to be the law of Maryland. Affirming, the court said that if it had been assumed for the argument that a natural healers act had ever been in force, it was repealed by the passage of the Maryland Medical Practice Act, 1888 Md. Laws 429. The Act was a complete scheme of regulation for the subject. It was a substitute for existing laws on the subject, repealing earlier laws. Where the Legislature dealt with the whole subject matter, there was an exception to the rule that repeal by implication was not favored. The repeal was not really by implication, but was actual, although not expressed. The trial court was right in forbidding counsel from arguing constitutionality to the jury. The provisions of Md. Const. art. XV, &sect; 5, had to be read that, whatever the other rights of the jury were to pass on the law, the jury had no right to pass on constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff owner, a landlord, challenged an order from the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland) that sustained a demurrer of defendant county commissioners to his bill of complaint without leave to amend, and that dismissed the bill. The owner's bill challenged the constitutionality of a special tax for a garbage zone that was imposed as an additional county tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner rented his houses to tenants. Twice the commissioners raised, without prior notice, the owner's tax bill by a garbage assessment charge and both times he protested and refused to pay that tax. The court held that Md. Code Pub. Loc. Laws art. 2, &sect; 238(A) was constitutional because the charge acted equally and was uniformly applied when areas containing more than one household unit paid a proportionately greater assessment. The court decided that the fact that the charge was levied and collected as county taxes did not make the charge a tax, but merely provided the manner of collection. The court determined that this was a special charge that differed from ordinary taxes because the payment of ordinary taxes did not result in an equivalence in taxes for common benefit. The court decided that Md. Code art. 81, &sect; 28(a) (1951), which required that a person subject to a tax assessment was entitled to advanced written notice, did not apply because the charge was legal and not a tax levy. The court found that no legal provision required notice for the type of charge at issue. The court found that the public garbage disposal system would increase the value of the owner's rentals.</SPAN></P>

The pubic areas of the body were either not photographed or were shadowed out so as not to be visible. The Board ordered all scenes showing bodies below the waist deleted. Affirming, the court said that a judge did not err in holding that the scenes ordered to be deleted would not, if shown as part of the movie, have caused it to amount to an erotic allurement or to a calculatedly effective incitement to sexual desires. The movie could not be said to have suggested, except to a prurient imagination, unchaste, or lustful ideas. It was neither obscene nor pornographic. The Board misinterpreted and misapplied the statute. There was no reasonable or substantial basis for a finding that the calculated purpose and dominant effect of the movie was substantially to arouse sexual desires.

The court held that city counsel's ordinance was reasonable, and gave billboard advertisers reasonable time to conform to the ordinance, by allowing them nonconforming use for five years.

The point urged was that the criminal penalty was imposed for failure to pay &quot;compensation to an injured employee,&quot; and the indictment alleged that the employer had failed to pay compensation to the son of an employee. The court found nothing in the statute that would have supported a contention that the plain words &quot;injured employee&quot; were enlarged by definition. Md. Ann. Code art. 101, &sect; 68(3) (1951) defined &quot;Employee&quot; in elaborate terms, but did not include dependents in the definition. That was in sharp contrast with Md. Ann. Code art. 101, &sect; 68(2) (1951), which defined &quot;Employer&quot; to include &quot;the legal representatives of a deceased employer.&quot; Since the criminal penalty had been imposed only for the employer's failure to pay an award to an injured employee, the employer's motion to dismiss should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

Code art. 81, &sect; 204 (1951) against defendant taxpayer for taxes assessed and levied for improvements on real estate as authorized by Montgomery County, Md., Code &sect; 22-2 (1950). The Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) granted the County's motion for summary judgment. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under the authority of a provision of Montgomery County, Maryland, Code &sect; 22-2 (1950), the County assessed improvements on the taxpayer's property for the first quarter of the taxable year at three-quarters of the regular rate levied by the State of Maryland. The County contended that the taxpayer waived his right to appeal by failing to file an administrative appeal. The court held that the taxpayer had a right to appeal from the tax levy. Md. Ann. Code art. 81 &sect; 209 (1951) only limited a taxpayer's challenge from assessments, not levies, to administrative appeals. The provision that authorized the tax violated Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 15 as it did not apply to the entire State. The tax was not uniformly applied to similarly situated property owners in other counties and, thus, discriminated against the County's property owners. However, &sect; 3 of the law that enacted Montgomery County, Maryland, Code &sect; 22-2 (1950) was a savings clause. Thus, the unconstitutional provision was severable. The remaining provisions of Montgomery County, Maryland, Code &sect; 22-2 (1950) were valid, enforceable, and provided a sufficient rule by means of which the tax was enforceable.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found no evidence to support the commission's findings and ordered it to restore the trainer's license. The commission appealed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state assessed a use tax on the vendor for orders shipped to vendors within the state. The vendor contended that the collection of a use tax was unconstitutional. The trial court held that the state had a right to collect a use tax on such foreign vendors soliciting orders within the state and shipping such orders to resident purchasers. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the use tax did not deny the vendor due process of law. The fact that the vendor's order solicitors were independent contractors rather than agents who were servants did not make a difference. The solicitors were agents of the vendor for the purpose of displaying its products by means of its catalogs, for the taking of orders for those products, for the forwarding of the orders to headquarters, and for the purpose of accepting deposits on the sales. Although the activities of the individual solicitors may have been intermittent, in total their activities were regular, systematic, and productive of a substantial flow of goods into Maryland to establish minimum contacts. Thus, it was proper for the state to exercise jurisdiction over the corporation and to collect the use tax by means of attachment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged orders of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland), which denied his petitions for a writ of mandamus compelling appellee, the Board of Supervisors of Elections of Baltimore County (Maryland) to place his name upon a ballot as a candidate for election to the county council. The appeal was previously advanced for argument in the court and affirmed in a per curiam opinion. The court stated the reasons for its decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant claimed that he substantially complied with Md. Ann. Code art. 33, &sect; 44 (1951) and that the Board, therefore, erred in failing to place his name on the ballot. Nominations were to be submitted no later than December 17, 1956. Under &sect; 44, the petitions for nomination were to contain the signatures of at least 500 voters who intended to vote for the candidate. Each signer was to append to the petition a paper containing certain information. Each such paper was to be accompanied by an affidavit of an officer assigned to take oaths stating that the affiant was personally known to the officer and was a registered voter of the district or precinct at issue. Although appellant timely submitted his petitions, he did not submit the required affidavits until December 19, 1956. In affirming the trial court's denial of mandamus compelling the Board to place appellant's name on the ballot, the court held that appellant did not substantially comply with &sect; 44. The affidavits were an integral part of the petitions and they were to be filed before the deadline. Because the affidavits were not timely filed, the petitions were not in timely form and were properly rejected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a resident, taxpayer, and registered voter, filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland) against defendant, the Board of Supervisors of Elections, to enjoin holding a special election to choose the first county council to serve under a newly adopted county charter. The County Commissioners intervened. Demurrers by the Board and the Commissioners were sustained without leave to amend. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court found that the nomination of the members of the charter board and their election were in strict accord with the directions of Md. Const. art. XIA and under the express terms of that article. Because there were but five nominees, their names did not go on the ballot. The provisions of article XIA were clear and unambiguous statements in the basic instrument of government of Maryland, its constitution. There was no conflict or inconsistency between them and other provisions of the state constitution. Thus, they had to be accorded full weight and effect. Because the provisions were followed to the letter in the instant case, there was no doubt that the charter board was duly elected and constituted. The charter prepared by the charter board and adopted by the voters became the law of Baltimore County and was entitled to the presumption of validity that was applicable to any regularly adopted law. Further, it was beyond the power of a court to pass or amend a law, which was what plaintiff wanted the court to do.</SPAN></P>

The inmate was tried, convicted, and sentenced on a charge of receiving stolen goods. The inmate challenged the constitutionality of a Virginia parole statute, Md. Ann. Code art. 41, &sect; 91H (Supp. 1956).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was paroled for 604 days of community time but was returned to prison due to a violation of his conditions of parole. Upon his return to prison, a board of parole and probation credited him with one-half of the time spent on parole, 302 days. The inmate argued that he was entitled to credit for the full time he had spent outside of prison but under the supervision of the parole board. Md. Ann. Code art. 41, &sect; 91H (1956 Supp.) permitted the parole board, after revocation of an order of parole, to grant or withhold credit for community time spent while on probation. The inmate argued that &sect; 91H was unconstitutional. The court did not decide whether an inmate could raise the issue of credit given for parole time on habeas corpus, but it noted that the inmate was not deprived of any constitutional rights by the parole board's exercise of its discretion. In denying the application, the court noted that &sect; 91H had been recently upheld as constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, an inmate, filed an application for leave to appeal from the denial of a writ of habeas corpus by the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland). The inmate was tried, convicted, and sentenced as a third offender under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 369 (1951) for a violation of a narcotics law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate based his right to relief on two grounds. First, he argued that he was illegally confined because his sentence was based on Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 369 (1951), which the inmate argued was unconstitutional as ex post facto. Second, he alleged that while incarcerated, he timely filed his appeal but that the appeal was not allowed to leave the institution until two weeks after the time for appeal had expired. The court noted that a statute imposing a greater punishment on a previously-convicted defendant did not create a new offense but only an added penalty, was prospective in operation, not retrospective, and was constitutional. Also, the judgment of a court of general jurisdiction, which had power to decide constitutional questions and questions of its own jurisdiction, was not a nullity, and a direct appeal was available. Because the petition on its face raised questions of constitutional rights that should have been resolved, the court remanded the case for a determination whether the inmate's allegations concerning his attempt to appeal were true. If true, the inmate was entitled to appeal, and the State had to furnish a delayed appeal or release him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the inmate's application for leave to appeal from the circuit court's denial of a writ of habeas corpus. The court remanded the case so that a writ could issue and a hearing be held to determine whether the inmate's allegations regarding his attempt to appeal were true. The court directed that if the circuit court determined that the inmate was entitled to appeal, the court clerk should promptly forward the record to the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Md. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8 guaranteed a litigant the right to remove an action from a court if he could not have a fair and impartial trial in the court in which the action was filed. Md. Ann. Code art. 75, &sect; 118 required a litigant to pay the cost of removing the case prior to its removal to another court. The individual was sued in one county, and he petitioned to remove the action to another county. He did not pay the removal costs. An order was entered directing him to pay the costs, and in the event the costs were not paid, the original court was directed to place the matter on its docket. The individual challenged the constitutionality of the code provision. The court noted that there was a presumption that any legislation was constitutional, and that the issue of the constitutionality of any legislation was required to be squarely before it in order to render a judgment on the constitutional question. It held that the issue was clearly before it. It noted that the removal clause of the state constitution was to be liberally construed. It held that the individual's absolute right to removal was denied by the requirement that he pay the costs before the case was removed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order. It found that the code provision violated the state constitution, and it remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer contended that the increases in salaries violated Md. Const. art. 3, &sect; 35. The city officials contended that &sect; 35 did not apply to the city officials because Md. Const. art. 11 set up a separate and distinct framework for the government of this political subdivision and that art. 11 was free from the restraint of Md. Const. art. 3, &sect; 35. The court ruled that Md. Const. art. 3, &sect; 35 was applicable to the city officials. The court held that the Legislature, by virtue of Md. Const. art. 11, &sect; 9, possessed the same power over the city, with the sole exception that related to the incurring of indebtedness, that it had over the Charter of any other city or town in the State. The court held that the fact that there was a separate article that prescribed the framework of government for the city did not give the city immunity from the constitutional restraints upon the Legislature and the municipal corporations of Maryland. The court ruled that the city officials did not derive any power pursuant to the Home Rule Amendment to change public officials' salaries during office. The court held that the rule of contemporaneous construction did not apply to Md. Const. art. 3, &sect; 35.</SPAN></P>

Code art. 66A, &sect; 6 was not unconstitutional because it was directed at advocacy, not discussion. The court held that from the record the censored part of the film did not &quot;advocate or teach&quot; the use of, or the methods of use of, narcotics. The court held that the evidence was strong and convincing that the picture was likely to have a beneficial effect as a deterrent from the use of narcotics. Therefore the court ruled that the censored part of the film did not violate Md. Ann. Code art. 66A, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant contended that the statute was vague and uncertain and failed to fix an ascertainable standard of guilt. The court found no merit in his contention. The court found that in the language of &sect; 627 a clear legislative intention to cover the whole field of unnatural and perverted sexual practices. It was unnecessary to describe in detail practices which were matters of common knowledge. Defendant also contended that there was a variance between the indictment and the proof. The prosecuting witness testified that in addition to other sexual practices performed upon him by defendant at the time and place described, there was an act of sodomy. The court found that the evidence came in without objection, and there was other evidence legally sufficient to support the conviction. There was no prejudicial error. Assuming that the testimony was not within the scope of &sect; 627, it was so closely linked to the crime charged as to be admissible.</SPAN></P>

The title was not misleading and the mere existence of an exception did not make it misleading. The court held that the ordinance did not unlawfully delegate power to an administrative board. The state could impose the duty of ascertaining specific facts on which a prescribed application of police power depends upon administrative officers. The board did not prescribe minimum wages in excess of those it found to be the prevailing wages, therefore, it did not act outside of its prescribed power. The ordinance was not unconstitutionally indefinite. The court held that the term locality could include both areas within the city and nearby city-owned property. The ordinance's establishment of different wage scales for different types of labor was a constitutional reasonable classification. The trial court properly refused to enforce a contract that submitted without complying with the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a decree declaring that the ordinance and the director's regulation were valid, with the exception of the provisions in the regulation as to minimum fines and presumptions as to guilt, which were invalid. On appeal, the taxpayers contended that the power to set speed limits was a legislative power, and the mayor and city council could not lawfully delegate it to an administrative official. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the city had no power to regulate the speed of vehicles on any street that was a part of the state or federal highway system or an extension thereof.

The inmate appealed to the circuit court, which again found him guilty. The inmate was sent to the reformatory but placed later on parole. The parole was revoked for violating a condition of parole, that of driving. Among the inmate's major challenges were that he could raise issues in a habeas corpus petition that should have been brought up in a direct appeal because there was no right to appeal from the circuit court and that the sentencing was cruel and unusual. The court denied the applications. Where the inmate chose a trial before a magistrate, there was no right to appeal beyond the circuit court. Both the magistrate and the circuit court had jurisdiction to hear the issues before them, and a habeas petition was not the place to retry the criminal case. On other issues, assault and battery was a common law crime, and there was no requirement that the crime be listed in the statutes. A one-year sentence was not cruel and unusual. When the inmate admitted the parole violation, the evidence supported the revocation. Further, a formal trial was not required to determine if parole was violated.</SPAN></P>

Defendants mounted a constitutional due process challenge, among other claims. On appeal, the court found no errors. Any defects in the session laws relative to the wording of the title compared to the body created in a former version were cured by the repeal of Md. Ann. Code art. 2B and its reenactment in 1947 Md.

The court affirmed the trial court's order and held that: (1) a hearing was not mandatory on the refusal of a permit under &sect; 21; (2) the Commission in determining the need for additional taxicabs acted in a legislative capacity, therefore, due process did not require a hearing; (3) the Commission had discretion as to whether it would grant a hearing, unless its determination was arbitrary or illegal; and (4) mandamus did not lie since the drivers' had not exhausted their administrative remedies. Notice and hearing were not essential to the validity of administrative action where the administrative body acted in the exercise of legislative functions. Further, a review of the action of the Commission in denying a permit was afforded under Md. Ann. Code art. 78, &sect; 74 (1951).</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied relief to the property owners, and they appealed. The court ruled that the power of the government to interfere by zoning regulations with the general rights of a land owner in restricting the character and use of his property was not unlimited and those rights were within the protection of the federal and state constitutions. Further, the court held that all uses of property which were injurious to the health, comfort, safety, and welfare of society could be prohibited under the sovereign power of the state, even though the exercise of such power resulted in inconvenience or loss to certain persons. The court affirmed the decree denying relief to the property owners, concluding that the property owners failed to show that if the ordinance was enforced the consequent restrictions upon their property precluded its use for any purpose to which it was reasonably adapted.</SPAN></P>

Md. Const. art. XI-E, the Municipal Home Rule Amendment, provided that amendment of a city's charter could be proposed by a resolution of the city's legislative body or by a petition containing the signatures of at least five percent of the city's registered voters.

The city's proceedings to amend its charter under the new public general law, which included the adoption of a resolution and an ordinance approving the amendment, was valid. The adoption of the ordinance was mere surplusage that did not affect the resolution's validity.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city, by an enabling act, was authorized by the legislature to issue certificates of indebtedness, the proceeds of which were to be used for the purposes of providing places for storing, parking, and servicing vehicles, and to create a commission with full power to administer and supervise these expenditures. This commission was known as the Off-Street Parking Commission, of which defendant was appointed a member. Defendant, an attorney, received preferential treatment for his clients due to his position on the commission. Although the title of the ordinance was admittedly defective when first passed, the court held that this defect was corrected by the subsequent codification thereof and the adoption of the Baltimore City Code of 1892; therefore, the ordinance was valid. The court also held that the statute was definite enough to fix an ascertainable standard of guilt. Defendant's actions in taking part in approving contracts with his clients and their corporations that he had formed, without disclosure to any of the other members of the commission of the fact that he was the attorney for these contracting parties, violated the provisions of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant argued that 1955 Md. Laws 269 was unconstitutional to the extent that it permitted the governor to fill vacancies in newly created judicial offices. Three constitutional amendments were proposed, but only the amendment enlarging the governor's appointment power was adopted. Appellant argued that the governor's appointment power was contingent upon another proposed amendment that would have provided the legislature with the power to increase or decrease the number of judges. The court reviewed the legislative intent behind the amendment because it was ambiguous. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, finding that the amendment was not contingent on the adoption of the legislative power to change the number of judges. It was driven by the belief that comparatively few voters would know which judicial aspirants were best fitted for the judicial office and that they would be in a better position to know of a judge's fitness for the office after he had served at least a year as an appointee. The power to appoint judges to newly created offices was also consistent with the governor's power to fill vacancies in unexpired offices until the next election.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's application for a certificate of occupancy was denied by the Board of Appeals and affirmed on appeal. A special exception permit was authorized in a heavy commercial or industrial zone where the yard was invisible from and at least 300 feet distant from any state or county highway. Defendant was unsuccessful in his attempts to obtain a special exception permit, his yard was visible and within 200 feet of a highway, and he failed to appeal the board's adverse ruling.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff property owner appealed from a decree of the Circuit Court for Cecil County (Maryland), which dismissed his suit against defendant town commissioners asking the trial court to declare unconstitutional 1953 Md. Laws ch. 706, adopting a plat of the lots in the town, and to enjoin the commissioners from entering upon his property. The owner alleged that the Act deprived him of his property by increasing the width of the streets.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The chancellor dismissed the bill because of the property owner's failure to file necessary exhibits and because the bill and answer raised a question of title to real estate, which was not cognizable in a court of equity. The court disagreed with the chancellor. It was not necessary to file as exhibits all written instruments referred to in a bill of complainant. Instruments that were only items of proof might not be necessary exhibits. Further, although failure to file necessary exhibits precluded injunctive relief, it did not preclude any general relief to which a plaintiff might be entitled. Here, the fact that the property owner did not file plats or deeds with the bill did not warrant dismissal of the bill, although the owner might find it necessary to introduce them in evidence. The court also found that even thought the general rule was that a court of equity had no jurisdiction to decide questions of title to real estate, this general rule was subject to exceptions. Further, the commissioners had acquiesced in the property owner's choice of forum. The court held that the chancellor should decide the questions as to title and thereafter the Act's constitutional validity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Company sought permission from the Commission to increase several of its fares. The Commission permitted an increase in certain of the fares while keeping others the same. The Company asked the circuit court to vacate the order and enjoin the Commission from enforcing its provisions. The trial court dismissed the three bills of complaint, affirming the order of the Commission. On appeal, the Company's chief complaints as to the rate base were that the Commission ignored present value, that it relied only on historical value, and that it erred in its use of excessive depreciation of the rail properties. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the burden of proof was upon the one who complained of the validity of the Commission's order. The court held that its orders were correct and its judgment was accorded the respect due an informed body aided by a competent and experienced staff. There was no showing that the Commission's order produced a confiscation of the Company's property. The consideration that the Commission gave the value of the services rendered, in fixing the rate of return, neither infringed any constitutional right of the Company nor affronted any statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The challenged act undertook to amend the charter of the state school corporation to provide that thereafter its members should be the regents of the state university and that all of the rights, powers, duties, obligations, and functions of its members were conferred upon the regents. The trial court held that the act was unconstitutional and enjoined the board of regents from interfering with, taking possession of, or attempting to exercise any control over the funds, property, and assets of the corporation; it also enjoined the Maryland Trust Company, the agent, and custodian of the securities and funds of the corporation from delivering the same to the regents. On appeal, the court agreed, holding that the amendment exceeded the permissible limits of the reserved power to amend the corporate charter. The court found that the removal of the limitation was, in effect, a nullification of the charter, without any justification arising out of the police power or an existing proprietary interest in the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant company, a contractor for the federal government, disputed an order of the Circuit Court No. 2 of Baltimore City (Maryland), which affirmed an assessment by appellee State Tax Commission (commission) of a personal property tax against the company on equipment it was in the process of manufacturing for the military. The issue was whether the property should be exempt from taxation based on the federal government's sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The government had a lien on some of the equipment for which the company sought exemption and the government had made progress payments on the rest of the property. On appeal, the court agreed that the federal government was immune to state and local taxation. However, a property interest, less than a fee, was not exempted and was subject to state taxation. The court distinguished several United States Supreme Court cases relied upon by the company for the proposition that, although the government did not hold legal title to the property, it had equitable title and the property was therefore immune from taxation. The court held that any lien created by the contracts between the federal government and the company did not create an ownership interest in the government. Given that there was no difference between those contracts that provided for a lien and those that only provided for progress payments, none of the property manufactured under those contracts was immune from taxation. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizen filed his certificate of candidacy for judge of the Orphans' Court for Baltimore County with the Board. The Board indicated that he could have only filed in the primary election of the party of his affiliation, the Democratic Party. The citizen sought to file for nomination as a candidate for the same office in the Republican primary. Acting upon 1946 Md. Att'y Gen. Op. 160, the Board notified the citizen that he was not entitled to cross-file. The citizen sought a writ of mandamus from the circuit court to compel the Board to accept his certificate of candidacy in the Republican primary. The circuit court dismissed the petition. The citizen did not press for an appeal prior to the election, and as a result, the appeal was heard months after the election. The court stated that the chronology of the case made it apparent that it could have done nothing, by reversal or otherwise, to undo or remedy that which had already occurred. The court concluded that it was beyond the court's power to make a decision which would have bound any of the parties to it or accomplish any of the purposes for which it was brought or defended because the case was moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of abortion. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that appellant was prejudiced by the admission of testimony by a doctor who had neither examined the patient nor had any personal knowledge of her condition. The court noted that appellant's objection to the doctor's testimony on the ground that the hospital records to which he testified were inadmissible hearsay was properly overruled because such records were admissible in criminal actions pursuant to Md. Code. art. 35, &sect; 68 (1951), which provided that lack of personal knowledge by the entrant or maker could be shown to affect the weight, but not the admissibility, of the records. The court found that appellant's failure to object to the testimony on the appropriate grounds did not result in a waiver of her right to raise the admissibility of the testimony on appeal. The court held that, once appellant objected to the testimony as hearsay, she did not need to object to each subsequent question or to move to strike out each answer or all of the testimony. The court found that appellant did not lose the benefit of objection to the testimony by cross examining on the subject.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The suit for damages was instituted by the injured party against decedent to recover for personal injuries sustained in a motor vehicle collision on a highway in Maryland. The summons for the deceased defendant was served on the secretary of state as provided by the Maryland Motor Vehicle Act, and the service was attacked by the widow, which was also the executrix of the estate. The court found that the judge quashed the service of summons more than three years after the date of the accident. The court held that where a suit had been instituted against a person who was not a proper party defendant, the declaration could not be amended so as to substitute another sole defendant. In the absence of statutory authority, it was improper to make an amendment by which a party became a sole defendant in a new and distinct capacity from that in which he appeared as defendant prior to the amendment. The court held that in an action for damages sustained in an automobile collision on a highway in Maryland, service on a non-resident defendant, by leaving the summons with the secretary of state, was invalid if defendant died before the institution of the suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The municipal court judge found that the allegations contained in the Commonwealth's complaint set forth sufficient facts to establish that the father owed a duty of support to his dependents. The case was docketed as a law case and a summons was issued in standard form. The father filed a demurrer and motion to quash, alleging that such proceedings were unknown to the common law, and that there was no valid Maryland statute authorizing such proceedings. The circuit court sustained the father's demurrer and granted his motion to quash. On appeal, the court found that there was no indication in the record that a judgment was entered in the case. The father contended that the Support of Dependents Act was unconstitutional because it did not specifically provide for trial by jury. The court determined that the case should have been docketed on the equity side of the circuit and the case was remanded for that purpose. Because the court found that the proceedings should have been in equity, it was not necessary to pass upon the right to a jury trial in a proceeding at law, or whether a jury trial was forbidden under the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act in a law court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted and subsequently convicted of making book on a horse race within the forum county. Defendant challenged his conviction, arguing that bookmaking was not a crime within the forum county on the date of his alleged offense, and that the trial court's improper jury instruction was prejudicial to him because the trial judge rendered more than an advisory opinion regarding the applicable law. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that on and after June 1, 1953, bookmaking in the forum county was not exempt from the prohibitions and penalties provided by Md. Code art. 27, &sect; 310 (1951) because the title of Chapter 411 of the Acts of 1953 was not misleading as applied to the repeal of &sect; 310, and that the Act dealt with only one subject and sufficiently described it. The court concluded that nothing in the trial judge's instructions to the jury required a reversal of the judgment because the jury was told in the first instance that the remarks were only advisory, and therefore, could not have been misunderstood by the jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state passed a revenue law that reduced the annual tax on savings banks. In separate actions, the city and the taxpayer filed an action against appellees, seeking to have the act declared unconstitutionally ambiguous and unconstitutional pursuant to Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 29. Appellees filed demurrer' in both actions, which were sustained, dismissing the action. In this consolidated appeal, the court affirmed the orders of the trial court. The court held that appellants were entitled to challenge the constitutionality of the revenue law under the Declaratory Judgment Act because they did not bypass an administrative agency in so doing. However, the revenue law was not unconstitutionally ambiguous. Language that was inadvertently left in the law by the legislature, if given effect, would have defeated the intent of the legislature in passing the law, and therefore, the language was merely surplusage and would not defeat the law. Similarly, the law was not unconstitutional under Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 29 because the title adequately put all persons on notice of its content even though it contained surplus language.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland) nullified the commission's rezoning resolution. The oil company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commission rezoned the landowner's property from agricultural to heavy commercial. The landowner then transferred his property to the oil company, which sought to build a service station on the property. The property owners contended that the establishment of the service station would seriously depreciate their properties, would tend to destroy the comfort, well being, and property rights in the neighborhood, that the action of the commissioners was arbitrary, unreasonable, discriminatory, and without any substantial relation to the public health, morals or general welfare, and that such an action constituted spot zoning. In affirming the nullification of the rezoning resolution, the court held that the rezoning of the property was arbitrary and capricious. The court found that (1) there was no mistake in the original zoning of the property as agricultural, (2) the character of the neighborhood had not changed to such an extent as to justify the rezoning, and (3) the reasons given by the commissioners for rezoning the property were not supported by the facts in the case.</SPAN></P>

After he was apprehended, he pleaded guilty to the crime of escape and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. After he was transferred to the state reformatory, the prisoner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The trial court concluded that his conviction and sentence were unconstitutional because his commitment to Boys' Village did not constitute him a prisoner being detained in a penal institution in connection with a criminal matter, within the meaning of the escape statute. On appeal, the superintendent argued that Boy's Village fell within the scope of the escape statute, while the prisoner primarily argued that Boys' Village was not within the scope of the statute. The court held that the trial court erred in assuming to review on habeas corpus the alleged error in construing the escape statute. Habeas corpus was not a proper remedy because (1) a remedy by appeal was available to the prisoner, and (2) the judgment convicting and sentencing the prisoner for escape was not a nullity because the court that rendered it was a superior court of general jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was seen by a police officer in the rear of a factory that had been twice burglarized within five weeks. Defendant claimed that he had been at a dance at a small club and had stopped to relieve himself. Upon a search of defendant's person, police found a pair of pliers, three screw drivers, a wrench, and a drill, all of which were stuck down inside his jacket. On appeal, defendant contended that the articles found in his possession should not have been admitted in evidence because his arrest was illegal and therefore, the evidence found as a result of that arrest was not admissible. The court reasoned that defendant waived this right by failing to object to the evidence at the time it was offered. The court reasoned that defendant did not avail himself of the opportunity to move before trial that they be returned to him or held unavailable as evidence against him, because of the illegality of the arrest, nor did he object at the trial until they were fully in evidence. The court further concluded that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction and that there was no error in the verdict of the trial court on the charge of being a rogue and vagabond.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. III, &sect; 52(8)(b) by constituting a supplementary appropriations bill and directing the use of general funds. The court agreed that ch. 780, &sect; 9 was void because it conflicted with and nullified ch. 780, &sect; 8 and the Maryland Constitution because requiring money from the general funds frustrated the constitutional purpose for the levy and collection of an annual tax for the purpose.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county asserted that the transfer was unauthorized, ultra vires, and void because Md.

The court agreed that art. 1008, &sect; 2 clearly restricted conveyances by the county. However, the court did not accept the county's contention that it had no authority to provide recreational facilities to the planning commission. The court held that the county, by making the disputed conveyance, did not act ultra vires because it was not unknown for more than one governmental body to exercise simultaneous jurisdiction over the same subject matter. The court held that Md. Code Ann. art. 25, &sect; 10 clearly authorized the county to establish and/or maintain reasonable facilities for public recreation, which clearly empowered the county to contract for recreational facilities and permit the planning commission to establish such facilities as an authorized agency for that purpose.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners petitioned the county commissioners to reclassify their lot, located at a road intersection, from residential to commercial. The neighbors to the lot sought an injunction against the reclassification. The trial court granted the injunction. On appeal, the court reversed the decree granting the injunction. The court held that the action was neither illegal, nor arbitrary, nor discriminatory because there were abundant facts presented to the county commissioners to sustain their decision. The original zoning plan followed the natural, early zoning pattern (to make road intersections into commercial zones). At the time the zoning ordinance was enacted, it was known that the road would have to be relocated and had the county commissioners known its future location, it would have been zoned for commercial use in the first place. There were already nonconforming uses adjacent to the land to be rezoned. There had been substantial change to the neighborhood since the original enactment of the zoning ordinance. Finally, there was a definite need for a commercial area.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant was convicted of assault with intent to rob and assault and battery, defendant sought review of the judgment on the ground that the trial court improperly disregarded 1952 Md. Laws 69, which permitted the removal of any criminal case that was punishable by imprisonment in the state penitentiary. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that defendant did not appeal from the trial court's ruling refusing a removal, but that the appeal came from a final judgment. Therefore, the court held that it was not necessary to decide whether the refusal to grant a removal was immediately reviewable. The court ruled that the legislature was not entitled to provide for absolute right of removal in cases punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary, except by constitutional amendment. Because 1952 Md. Laws 69 was not a constitutional amendment, the court declared that it was invalid. Defendant did not show that there was reasonable ground for removal.

The court found that there was no reason to hold that the 1951 statute, making illegally procured evidence admissible in certain trials in the county, was in conflict with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution or Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 23. The court held that 1951 Md. Laws 704 did no more than prescribe a rule of evidence. Rules of evidence were not a constituent part of any contract and were not of the essence of any right that a party may seek to enforce. The court held that the State, having the right to control procedure in its courts, had the power to regulate the admissibility of evidence without denial of equal protection of the laws. The court concluded that the statute assailed by defendant did not violate the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

The superior court sustained the Comptroller's demurrer, and the owner sought review. The court affirmed, finding that the owner was subject to taxation under Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court considered the issue as to the maximum penalty that could be given for violation of Md. Ann.

Defendant argued that the title to Md. Ann Code ch. 311 (1951) was not sufficiently descriptive to permit the body of the Act legally to amend the penalty provisions of Md. Ann. Code art. 89B (1951). The court agreed. It appeared from its title that the intention was to amend Md. Ann. Code art. 66 1/2 and not to amend Md. Ann. Code art. 89B (1951). Md. Ann. Code art. 66 1/2 (1951) had no special provisions as to height, width, length, and weight of motor vehicles operating on bridges. The title to Chapter 311 specified motor vehicles operating on the State highway and made no mention of Md. Ann. Code art. 89B (1951) or bridges. The amended penalty provision of Md. Ann Code ch. 311 (1951) as applied to Md. Ann. Code art. 89B (1951) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Act authorized the Comptroller to fix maximum discounts or prohibit them by wine wholesalers and to require the filing of price schedules for wine and liquor. The company filed a suit against defendants for a declaration that the Act was unreasonable and void and for an injunction to prevent the Comptroller and the Chief from enforcing the act and the Comptroller's regulations under it. After the circuit court dismissed the suit on a demurrer, the company appealed. The court affirmed. In Maryland, no one had a constitutional right to engage in the liquor business except as regulated by law. The Sherman Act did not restrain state action or official action directed by a state. If the Act operated directly on dealers without the intervention of state agencies, it would still have been within state power under the Twenty-first Amendment. The court did not recognize that the state had the burden of proof to show that the means were reasonably necessary and appropriate for the accomplishment of the Act. The Act was limited to data that the Comptroller reasonably required. The company did not allege that the Comptroller made any unreasonable requirement of information.</SPAN></P>

The court held as follows: (1) there was nothing in the statutes under which the hospital was constructed and was operated, or in the State grants of aid, which authorized the county to operate the hospital; (2) the court would not assume in the absence of explicit averment, that the county had operated the hospital as a proprietary institution for profit; and (3) the court granted the request for a new trial because the case could have presented questions of importance regarding the Act of 1947.</SPAN></P>

The trial court determined that chapter 414 was unconstitutional pursuant to Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 34, which prohibited the State from loaning its credit to another. The university appealed, and the court reversed. When construing a constitutional provision such as &sect; 34, the court had to avail itself of the construction put upon it by the legislature. If this was not clearly expressed, the court had to look to the necessity and nature of the thing provided for or against. Reviewing the history of &sect; 34 and the history of similar provisions in other states, the court concluded that there was not prohibition against making appropriations to private institutions provided the purpose was public or semi-public. Giving the university the cash proceeds of a loan was not prohibited by &sect; 34.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The broadcast company's bill alleged that it had entered into a contract with an advertiser to broadcast advertisements during a program that was broadcast on Sundays.

The broadcast company asserted that the ordinance was unconstitutional and that the broadcast company had no plain, complete, and adequate remedy at law. On appeal of the trial court's denial of the injunction, the court affirmed and held that the broadcast company had no standing to sue where it had an adequate remedy at law. Further, because the threat that the advertiser would cancel the deal was the real cause of the breach, the burden was upon the broadcast company to state facts showing that its remedy at law was inadequate and that it would suffer irreparable injury, which it failed to do.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A Prince George's County, Maryland, grand jury indicted petitioner detainee on several criminal counts. The detainee filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus against respondent county sheriff seeking to be released from the jail where he was incarcerated pending trial on the charges. He applied for leave to appeal after the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland) denied the petition and refused to issue the requested writ.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In his petition, the detainee asserted that the indictment was defective because it was based upon evidence presented by witnesses who had not been properly sworn in. He claimed that the grand jury did not have jurisdiction to find an indictment based upon such unsworn testimony and that, therefore, the trial court should not have exercised any jurisdiction over him. The evidence showed that the grand jury witnesses had been sworn in, but the swearing in had occurred outside of the courtroom itself. The trial court denied the detainee's writ application, holding that no jurisdictional question was raised. In denying the detainee's application for further review, the court held that the detainee had other legal avenue available to him to challenge the propriety of the indictment; he did not assert any fundamental rights or exceptional circumstances that could not be raised by proper legal procedure. The writ habeas corpus was not designed for collateral review of errors of law committed by a trial court.

Ann. Code art. 77, &sect; 14(a) was unconstitutional, that proposed rules issued by the Superintendent were invalid, and for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The proprietor, who had operated a barber school since 1913, claimed that Md. Ann. Code art. 77, &sect; 14(a), which provided for state certification and regulation of private trade schools, violated the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the Constitution of the United States because it was an improper delegation of a legislative function and deprived him of his property rights without due process of law. The court determined that the proprietor did not have to first apply for a permit to engage in the business of operating a trade school and then, if it was refused, take the various appeals outlined in the statute in order to raise the constitutional question of the validity of the statute as a whole. The court further ruled that the statute was not an unlawful delegation of legislative power because the general standards prescribed by the statute, albeit broad, were sufficiently explicit to limit the Superintendent in his actions and not permit him to exercise arbitrary power. The court declined to consider the proprietor's attack on the proposed rules and regulations, ruling that he could not by-pass the administrative remedy outlined in the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court on appeal found that the determination by the housing authority in fixing the income limits of persons to occupy the housing projects was not so oppressive, arbitrary, or unreasonable as to have suggested bad faith. The court noted that the housing authority had been provided with a staff of technical and statistical experts for the purpose of furnishing it with facts and figures.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant wholesaler association sold various goods at a lower than cost price. In an effort to restrict such practices, plaintiff grocers brought suit against defendant claiming that such actions amounted to an anti-competitive breach of the Unfair Sales Act (the Act), 1943 Md. Laws 803. The trial court agreed and issued a decree permanently enjoining defendant from advertising or selling at wholesale, any item. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute and further argued that it met an exception allowing a provider to sell goods for a lower cost in order to meet competition. Upon final determination, the Court of Appeals reversed the decree, holding that that the exception under the Act could possibly perpetuate illegal wholesale pricing on a grand scale. Accordingly, the Court deemed the Act unconstitutional because the exception would allow for a contradictory purpose not intended by the drafters.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance rezoned the landowners' property from commercial and industrial to residential. The landowners filed the declaratory judgment action to have the ordinance declared invalid as against their property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners challenged Baltimore, Md., Ordinance No. 510, which rezoned their property. The court determined that the landowners had the right to ask for declaratory relief. The landowners claimed that the rezoning amounted to an unauthorized taking of their property because the property had no value for residential purposes. The landowners claimed that the ordinance was contrary to &sect; 3 of the Zoning Enabling Act, Md. Code Pub. Gen. Laws art. 66B, and that it amounted to a taking of the landowners' property without due process. The court found no justification for the rezoning. There was no showing of a mistake in the original zoning, and the character of the neighborhood had not changed to such an extent to justify the rezoning. The property had always been commercial, and apparently there was little chance of it ever being used for residential purposes. Rezoning to residential use resulted in preventing the landowners from using it, not only for its most suitable use, but for any practical use. Under the circumstances, the landowners' property was being taken from them without compensation, and the ordinance was void as to the landowners' property.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 30 was unconstitutional and void. The Circuit Court No. 2 of Baltimore City (Maryland) declared that the statute was unconstitutional and enjoined the Commission from attempting to act under it. The Commission appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bill of complaint alleged that the effect of the statute in establishing schedules of wages would materially increase the cost of construction work of the State of Maryland, and thereby placed an additional burden upon the taxpayers of Maryland. The Commission contended that the taxpayers had no standing to maintain the suit. The Commission stated that neither as taxpayers, nor as persons engaged in the contracting business, had they sufficient interest in the subject, that none of their legal rights had been violated, and therefore the bill was required to be dismiss. The Commission asserted that no contractor had a right to a contract for State work; that the State had a right to fix the hours of work and the wages to be paid in contracts made with it; that the four contractors had no standing under these conditions, as such; and that the association of contractors had no standing whatever. Preliminarily, the court held that the taxpayers were entitled to bring suit. The court, however, held that the statute was not in the general public welfare and, therefore, was not within the power of the Legislature to pass at a 30-day session.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

All appellees were owners of property for which the services under the statute could be performed, and they were all plumbers who could be prohibited from doing certain work. They had, therefore, special interests that were affected by the provisions of the act. Legislation could be enacted under Md. Const. art. II, &sect; 15, if it affected the general public welfare or was an acute emergency. The court held that it could not be argued that a purely local statute, affecting only parts of two counties and having no application, either financial or otherwise, to any other part of the State, could be in the general public welfare. It could only be upheld, if at all, under &sect; 15(2), which allowed legislation dealing with an acute emergency. Although the legislation declared that an acute emergency existed, the court held that such a legislative determination did not prevent the court from deciding otherwise. The court found that, under the circumstances, it was unable to find any acute emergency or any emergency whatsoever, and the decree of the chancellor was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it had already determined that &sect; 444A was constitutional and reaffirmed that holding. Although the trial court's instruction regarding defendant's failure to testify was unnecessary, it was not reversible error. After noting defendant's failure to testify, the trial court properly instructed the jury immediately that this failure was no basis for an inference of guilt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant county appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland), which granted plaintiff taxicab operator a judgment in his action to recover moneys collected from him by the county as fees for operating taxicabs in the county. A trial magistrate granted judgment in favor of the operator, and the county appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue before the court was whether the county had authority, under 1945 Md. Acts ch. 941, to impose upon the owner or operator of a taxicab any registration fee or license fee for operating it in the county. 1945 Md. Acts ch. 941 added a new sub-title, &quot;Taxicabs,&quot; and three new sections to Montgomery County, Md., Code Pub. Loc. Laws tit. 16, which provided generally for the regulation in the county of taxicabs and their owners and operators by the county commissioner and for regulation of taxicab rates. Montgomery County, Md., Code Pub. Loc. Laws tit. 16, &sect; 1130B provided that the regulations of the act were in addition to any regulations by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles or the Public Service Commission. The court found that the Act of 1945 was not, in whole or in part, unconstitutional under Md. Const. art. 3, &sect; 29. Any uncertainty as to whether or not the act changed the policy of the state declared in the Motor Vehicles Act arose out of uncertainty as to whether regulation of taxicabs was a subject for which provision was made in Md. Ann. Code art. 66 1/2 or a fee for operating taxicabs was a fee for the use of a motor vehicle upon any public highway in the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and ordered remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, a naturopath, filed an action against appellees, the Board of Medical Examiners for the State of Maryland, the Police Commissioner, and the State's Attorney of Baltimore City, to declare that naturopathy was not included in the practice of medicine as regulated by the Medical Practice Act, Md. Ann. Code art. 43, &sect; 116-144. The Circuit Court of Baltimore City (Maryland) sustained appellees' demurrer. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The naturopath contended that the practice of naturopathy, in which he was engaged, was a separate and distinct branch of the healing art and not the practice of medicine as regulated by the Medical Practice Act, as defined by Md. Ann. Code art. 43, &sect; 139. The State Board of Medical Examiners, by reason of the opinions of the Attorney General, contended that naturopathy was a practice of medicine and surgery and that, therefore, appellees were preparing to prosecute the naturopath for the unlawful practice of medicine and surgery. The court held that no threat of interference by appellees appeared beyond that implied by the existence of the law and the opinions delivered by the Attorney General of Maryland. Moreover, the court held that the naturopath did not allege that he had been ordered to discontinue the practice of naturopathy. The mere existence of a criminal statute was not such a threat as to present a justiciable controversy. Therefore, the bill of complaint did not state such a cause as to justify the declaratory decree or the injunction prayed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1923, appellant was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. The Governor pardoned him in 1941, subject to certain conditions. In 1943, the Governor revoked the pardon. Appellant sought a writ of habeas corpus. The lower court issued an order remanding him to the custody of the warden of the penitentiary. The lower court stated that the important factor in the revocation of the pardon was the report of a doctor, which indicated that appellant was not a safe person to be pardoned. Appellant declared that he did not commit any criminal act or any act that would reflect upon his character or integrity while on parole. Appellant contended that the Governor's order revoking his pardon, without giving him an opportunity to be heard, deprived him of due process of law. Because appellant did not have an opportunity to be heard, the court modified the order appealed from, and remanded the case with directions that appellant be given a hearing, or that he be released from custody in case such a hearing was not given within a reasonable time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant candidates sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland) that sustained the demurrer filed by appellee Secretary of State to the candidates' petition for writ of mandamus. The candidates asked the trial court to compel the Secretary to accept their nominations without the affidavits required by the Subversive Activities Act of 1949, Md. Ann. Code art. 85A, &sect; 15, and the trial court dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The act provided that before a candidate's name could be placed on the ballot for any office, the candidate was required to complete an affidavit in which he swore that he was not a subversive person as defined by the act. The candidates each alleged that they possessed the necessary qualifications for the offices for which they had been nominated and that their certificates of nomination were rejected because they refused to file the affidavits. According to the candidates, the act was invalid because it violated Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 37 that prohibited the legislature from requiring any oath of office other than that prescribed by the State Constitution. On appeal, the court first found that since filing this action, two of the candidates had submitted the required affidavits and that their appeals were therefore moot. The court then found that one of the remaining candidates was running for the United States House of Representatives, a federal office and that the statute was inoperative as to her. Finally, the court held that with regard to the candidate for governor, the requirements of the act were a reasonable safeguard of state elections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dismissed the appeals of the two candidates who signed the affidavits and affirmed the order that dismissed the petition for writ of mandamus filed by the candidate for governor. With regard to the petition filed by the candidate for the United States House of Representatives, the court reversed the order of dismissal and held that she was entitled to have her name on the ballot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The voters filed a class suit to enjoin the board from accepting the candidate's application for nomination for the office of member of the county council. The county, the county Democratic committee, and the candidate were permitted to intervene. The trial court dismissed the voters' bill, and they appealed, arguing that Md. Ann. Code art. 25A, &sect; 1A (Supp. 1947) was unconstitutional and invalid and that candidates for election to the office of member of the county council had to be nominated and elected in accordance with Montgomery County, Md., Laws ch. 12 (1949). The court noted that the power of the county to enact local laws was restricted to matters covered by the express powers granted. The court further noted that the location of Md. Ann. Code art. 25A, &sect; 1A (Supp. 1947) confirmed that the provisions of Md. Ann. Code art. 33 dealing with primaries and elections applied generally to all candidates for public office in the counties and in Baltimore City. The court found it was clear that, in the absence of an act of the general assembly authorizing a change in the election system, the system set up in Montgomery County, Md., Laws ch. 12 (1949) was not legally permitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The residents and the property owners lived in the same neighborhood, which was classified as a residential district. The Ordinance amended the city's zoning ordinance by reclassifying the property owners' premises from residential to first commercial use district for the purpose of permitting them to conduct a funeral home on their premises. The buildings engineer then issued a permit to the property owners for them to use their premises as such. Although the residents could not see the front of the funeral home, they could see the garage in the rear. They then brought an action against defendants, the mayor, the City Council of Baltimore, and their related parties, to annul the Ordinance, direct the buildings engineer to revoke the permit, and restrain the property owners from using their premises as a funeral home. The lower court dismissed the residents' bill of complaint. The court reversed the decree, holding that permitting the property owners to use their premises as a funeral home was beyond the statutory power of the City Council because the Ordinance provided for unreasonable and discriminatory &quot;spot zoning.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant oyster packers sought to overturn the decree of the Circuit Court for Somerset County (Maryland), which sustained a demurrer to the packers' bill of complaint and dismissed their bill. Appellee commissioners opposed the packers' appeal, and the application of Md. Ann. Code art. 72, &sect; 4(c) was central to the dispute between the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The packers' bill alleged that because of the depletion of the Maryland supply of oysters, they were required to import oysters from private planters in other states and that many of the out-of-state oysters were smaller than oysters that were permitted to be taken in Maryland. The packers further alleged that the imported oysters were not game oysters and that the imported oysters met Federal quality standards. Thus, the packers contended that &sect; 4(c) violated the Federal Commerce Clause. Upon appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decree. The court held that Maryland had the right to regulate the possession and sale of game within in its borders and that game taken out-of-state could be used by lawbreakers to mask the taking of game within the State. Thus, because out-of-state oysters that were brought into Maryland could affect Maryland's supply of oysters, Md. Ann. Code art. 72, &sect; 4(c) could validly be applied to out-of-state oysters that were transported to Maryland.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a prior action, a non-resident of the county filed an action contesting the constitutionality of an act that provided for the licensing of coin-operated mechanical or electrical amusement devices or machines in the county. The act was held void, and a decree was signed enjoining the county commissioners from issuing any licenses under the act. The resident then filed an application for a license. The application was denied. The resident then asked for a writ of mandamus directing the Board to receive and pass upon his application. The Board, in its answer, set up the unconstitutionality of the act and the decree in the prior case as its defense. The trial court dismissed the petition. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order. The court held that the provision in the title for the licensing amusement devices did not sufficiently describe the intention of the act, which was to permit such machines to be used for gambling purposes. The court stated that the purpose of Md. Const. art. 3, &sect; 29 was to give notice generally of intention of a proposed act. The court found that the title of the act in question was misleading as to the contents of the enactment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the cross-bill. On appeal, the court affirmed, with costs. The court held that the place where further testimony and also the testimony already taken should have been offered was not in court but before the administrative body whose action the property owner sought to prevent by injunction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complainants sued as taxpayers in a class suit alleging that their party was a legal political party, directly affiliated with the Communist Party of the United States and that it had adopted the constitution of the latter. They contended that the Act was a bill of attainder directed against them, which constituted a malicious misrepresentation of the aims, purposes, and nature of Communism. On review, the court reversed the judgment because the complainants did not present a justiciable case and had no standing. The court held that if the recitals in the Act constituted a misrepresentation of the philosophy of Communism, that fact alone would not invalidate the Act or even admit it to judicial redress. The court found that the recitals merely expressed the legislative motive and its view of the public need for legislation of this character. The recitals formed no part of the Act itself. The court found that it was unnecessary to decide whether the recitals of the preamble could be used in aid of any prosecution, or to justify or support a conviction under the Act for sedition and reserved those issues for determination in a proper case.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and dismissed the complaint. The court found the issues were not ripe for decision because none of the concerned taxpayers had been affected by the Act. The taxpayers alleged that they had an interest because of an alleged waste of public funds in enforcing the Act. The court held that this interest was not sufficient because the court had no power to adjudicate constitutional issues for the taxpayers who were not directly affected. They had not been threatened with prosecution, nor did they indicate that they had violated or were about to violate any of the criminal provisions of the Act.

The inmate was imprisoned for robbery with a dangerous or deadly weapon in violation of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 558.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate's grounds for application for habeas corpus or for leave to appeal included: (1) his sentence was void because it was imposed while the trial court was not in session; (2) &sect; 558 was unconstitutional because it permitted cruel and unusual punishment; (3) a trial by jury could not be waived; (4) false testimony was used by the State; and (5) he was unable to appeal because Maryland did not provide for appeal in forma pauperis in a non-capital case. The court said that the testimony of the inmate and his brother that the court was on luncheon recess when his sentence was imposed did not show that the sentences were not imposed while the trial court was in session. A statement by the inmate's brother implicating the inmate, allegedly obtained under duress, was not admitted in evidence against the inmate. The inmate failed to make timely objections on any of the points raised on appeal before the trial court. The inmate's criminal case could not be reviewed on habeas corpus when a remedy by appeal was, or had been, available and the trial court's judgment was not a nullity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Complainant companies sought review of a decree from the Circuit Court for Allegany County (Maryland), which dismissed their bill seeking a decree declaring unconstitutional the Maryland Strip Mining Act, 1947 Md. Laws ch. 16 (codified at Md. Ann. Code art. 89, &sect;&sect; 178-192 (Supp. 1947)) (Act), and restraining enforcement of the Act by defendants, the Bureau of Mines of Maryland and various state officials.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The companies were the owner of coal land and a lessee with the right to strip mine the coal from the land and they brought an action against defendants seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, challenging the validity of the Maryland Strip Mining Act, 1947 Md. Laws ch. 16 (codified at Md. Ann. Code art. 89, &sect;&sect; 178-192 (Supp. 1947)) (Act). The trial court dismissed the companies' bill and they appealed. The court reversed and remanded the case for the passage of a decree that the Act was void and that the bureau and various state officials were restrained from enforcing it, holding that the exemption of Garrett County from the provisions of the Act rendered the Act void on the ground of discrimination. The court determined that although the Act purported to be a general law applying to all strip mining of bituminous coal and fire clay throughout the state, except that in Garrett County, the only coal mined in Maryland was in Garrett and Allegany counties and thus the Act did not apply anywhere except in Allegany County. The court found no justification for the discrimination and concluded that the Act violated the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who was a minister, appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Cecil County (Maryland), which convicted him of unlawfully erecting and maintaining signs intended to aid in the solicitation or performance of marriages in violation of 1943 Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of violating &sect; 444A, which prohibited the posting or maintaining of any sign intended to aid in the solicitation or performance of marriages, as a result of his posting of illuminated signs at the entrance to his home and on the highway that indicated that he was a minister. Defendant appealed, claiming that &sect; 444A was unconstitutional because it violated his right to exercise freedom of religion. The court affirmed and ruled that the issue of whether defendant or anyone else could perform a marriage was not a religious question at all, except to people whose religion prohibited them from being married by defendant. Furthermore, &sect; 444A was a proper exercise of the legislature's power to regulate conduct for the protection of society in order to curb the thriving businesses of unethical ministers that had built up as a result of an increase of the number of couples coming from nearby states to be married in Maryland, subsequent to the passage of stringent marriage law in the nearby states. Accordingly, &sect; 444A did not violate defendant's constitutional right to freedom of religion.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that Act constitutional, declared plaintiffs' rights in the burned stalls, and reserved decision on plaintiffs' rights in the unburned stalls.

On cross-appeal, the Authority contended that the trial court erred in declaring plaintiffs' rights in the unburned stalls. The court modified the trial court's decree. The court held that the Act did not deprive plaintiffs of rights without due process because &sect; 7 of the Act expressly provided that the Authority had the power to fix market rates.

The state comptroller demanded that the plumber pay a third license fee as a construction company under Md. Code Ann. art. 56, &sect; 291 because he used metallic piping and galvanized iron in his trade. The plumber filed a suit seeking a declaratory judgment that he was not required to obtain the third license. The superior court ordered the plumber to obtain the license. On appeal, the court reversed and awarded the plumber a new trial. The court held that the application of Md. Code Ann. art. 56, &sect; 291 was limited by its captions and title to construction companies. It was to be given effect without including plumbers because it did not disclose any reason for duplication of any of the license taxes in Md. Code Ann. art. 56. The court held that the particular enactment of a license requirement for plumbers under Md.

On appeal, the court reversed and held that the power to regulate the taxicab stands in the city resided in the mayor and city council as a valid exercise of the police power. The court held that the effect of the ordinance was to invalidate exclusive permits that had been granted to appellees. The permits at issue did not create vested rights for appellees; on the contrary, they were expressly subject to future regulation. The court recognized that while appellees' businesses might be adversely affected by the ordinance, appellees had no enforceable property rights in the streets superior to any ordinance adopted under the police power.

He also claimed that the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutional because it violated the prohibition against imprisonment for debt. The court first stated that the legal sufficiency of evidence before a grand jury was not reviewable on habeas corpus, and the competency of the evidence before the grand jury was not reviewable at all. As for the constitutionality of the statute, the court stated that habeas corpus was not a proper remedy when the remedy of appeal was available and the judgment was not a nullity. Any question as to the constitutionality of the statute could have been raised at the criminal trial, and would have been subject to review on motion for a new trial and on appeal. Finally, the court noted that the inmate had filed his own brief in which he complained of inadequate representation by counsel in his criminal trial. The inmate had not alleged that he asked at trial for postponement on account of absence of his counsel or made any complaint about the lawyer who appeared for him, or that the lawyer colluded with any State's officer.</SPAN></P>

The Act provided that it would not take effect until approved by a majority of the voters. The voters contended that part of the election was held in a bowling alley in contravention to the election laws of the state and that there was an illegal registration of 26 voters of whom 23 voted. The majority in favor of the Act was only 16. The trial court concluded that while the Act was valid and constitutional, the election was not valid and, therefore, the Act was not in force. The court reversed the decree of the trial court, finding that the mere irregularity of holding a portion of the election in a bowing alley was not sufficient to justify the invalidating of the election. The court also concluded that, although the registration of the voters without proper notice was illegal, the voters failed to meet their burden of showing that the votes of the illegally registered voters affected the result of the election.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The accused was an officer in a Maryland corporation that sold liquor. The corporation had buyers who came into Maryland and hauled liquor to North Carolina. The corporation reported the names and addresses of those customers to Maryland law enforcement agencies as required by law, and those agencies gave that information to North Carolina agencies. One customer had a false panel in his truck in which he transported more liquor than was reported to law enforcement. When this was discovered, North Carolina officials issued warrants for the accused and others. Extradition proceedings were brought against the accused to bring him to North Carolina. The trial court remanded the accused for extradition and the accused sought habeas corpus relief. The court found that the accused had a right of appeal of the trial court's decision under Md. Code art. 42, &sect; 3D, 1945 Md. Acts 702. The court also found that the extradition papers complied with &sect; 18 of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, Md. Code art. 41, &sect; 18, 1937 Md. Acts 179. The court further found that &sect; 18 of the Act was constitutionally valid and that the accused could be prosecuted by North Carolina and the federal government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1913, the state leased a parcel of maritime land to the leaseholder's predecessor for oyster culture. In 1915, the state brought condemnation proceedings against the predecessor as to his leasehold interest in the property, resulting in a jury verdict in favor of the state as to condemnation, and in favor of the predecessor, and against the state, in the amount of $ 9,000 as compensation for the condemned leasehold. However, the state never paid the compensatory award. The judgment was revived in 1927 and 1939. In 1946, the state sought to voluntarily dismiss the condemnation action, and filed a motion to strike out the judgment, which the trial court overruled. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision. The court held that the motion should have been granted, because, notwithstanding equities seeming to favor the leaseholder, the jury's compensatory verdict amounted only to a valuation, and not an actual taking, and Maryland law allowed the state to abandon a condemnation at any time prior to the payment of a compensatory award.</SPAN></P>

Const. art XIA, &sect; 3, provisions of a proposed charter that defendant Board of Supervisors of Elections of Montgomery County sought to submit to voters in an election. The Board and intervenors, a civic association, a Charter Board, and the County Commissioners of Montgomery County, all filed cross appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The resident filed an action to enjoin the Board from submitting to voters at an election a proposed charter for a county government. After a demurrer had been overruled, the intervenors were allowed to become parties defendant. Defendants contended that enjoining the submission to the voters of the proposed charter was an impermissible interference with the legislative process. The trial court found that art. XIA, &sect; 3 required all local legislation to be enacted within May of each year and therefore deleted provisions of the proposed charter that required the preparation of an expense budget and the making of necessary appropriations in the month of June each year. On appeal, the court held that the trial court was not authorized to delete the invalid portions of a charter and submit the remainder because the only charter that could be submitted to the voters was one drafted by the Charter Board without deletions. Additionally, the court determined that the making of appropriations was not a legislative function, therefore, the provisions were not invalid. As such, the proposed charter, as drafted, was available for vote at the election.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ice cream vendor attacked the constitutionality of the statute. He argued that because he was taxed in Baltimore City and Kent County at a higher rate than residents of Garrett County and certain merchants in Allegany County were exempt, that the classification was unreasonable. The court found that the remedy lay in restraining the proper taxing officials from allowing the exemption to its competitor. Since the ice cream vendor did not do business in Allegany County or Garrett County and the statute did not affect his rights, he could not contest its constitutionality. When there was a conflict between a city ordinance and the state law, the state law repealed the city ordinance. The fact that law enforcement officials did not enforce the statute did not make the law void when the legislature did not acquiesce in the decision. The title to the statute adequately informed the public of the general nature of the provisions to be enacted and did not result in the amendment being void. Since there was no actual controversy and no one had been arrested under the statute at issue, the court could not sustain the declaratory decree. The court reversed the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed. He argued that the Criminal Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) erred in refusing his motion to quash the indictment and in excluding evidence supporting his motion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under Balt., Md., City Charter &amp; Pub. Laws &sect; 687 (1938), judges were to provide a list of 750 persons that they believed were qualified to serve on juries. Before the beginning of each term, the judges provided a list of up to 15 persons who qualified as grand jurors. A jury clerk prepared and updated the lists. Originally, two blacks were called to serve on the grand jury. Both asked to be excused. At a special meeting, a white and a black man were selected to fill the vacancies. The court explained that the statute contemplated personal selection by the judges, or a majority of them, of each name on the list of 750. The court ruled that personal selection of the grand jury from a smaller list did not violate the statutory scheme; rather, it made the scheme workable. The court ruled that the testimony of established practice to limit black members of the grand jury to one was properly excluded because there was no offer to show that the practice continued. The court ruled that defendant failed to meet the burden of establishing a deliberate and intentional limitation on account of race in the selection of the grand jury.

Moreover, the court stated, Baltimore, Md., Zoning Ordinance 1247, para. 9, providing for certain accessory uses of a home, did not alter the prohibition in the preceding paragraph against the operation of a beauty parlor in a home in a residential use district. Furthermore, Md. Ann. Code art. 42, &sect;&sect; 479 and 489 made it unlawful for any person to practice beauty culture in any place other than a registered beauty shop and made it unlawful to use for residential purposes any room used wholly or in part as a beauty shop.

The ordinance had been held constitutional as a valid exercise of the police power. Furthermore, Md. Ann.

Even where the State obtained a new trial after conviction because of errors, while defendant was placed on trial a second time, it was not the sort of hardship that was forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment. Md. Ann. Code art. 52, &sect; 13 gave the State the right of appeal from the trial magistrate and was valid and constitutional.

The trial court granted defendants' demurrer but permitted plaintiffs the right to amend their bill. Judgment was subsequently granted in favor of plaintiffs, which allowed them to erect piers past their property lines, and defendants sought review. Pursuant to Baltimore, Md., City Code art. I, &sect; 6(8) (1938), the mayor and the city had full power and authority to provide for the preservation of the water including erecting and maintaining wharves, piers, and pilings, but under Baltimore, Md., City Code art. II, &sect; 558 (1938), no alteration, extension, or removal of wharves was permitted without consent. The court held that, under Md. Ann. Code art. 54, &sect; 47 (1939), landowners were given the exclusive right of making improvements into the water in front of their land. The court determined that plaintiffs were not permitted to infringe upon defendants' riparian rights without their consent.

No right to admittance existed at common law, and the legislature had conferred no personal right on individuals to attend or bet at race meetings.

The applicant filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, arguing among other things that the protestants were not qualified to maintain the appeal. The court granted the motion to dismiss. Only a few of the protestants had been heard by the board in the administrative proceeding and none of the protestants intervened in the circuit court proceeding. Therefore, there was nothing in the record to show that the protestants had the right to appeal. The court noted that the right to appeal, first to the circuit court and then to the court of appeals, was limited by statute, Md. Ann. Code art. 2B, &sect; 63 (1943 Supp.), at each step in the process. The circuit court was required to review administrative decisions with a presumption that they were correct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1989, a court entered a paternity judgment declaring defendant to be the father of plaintiff's child and ordering defendant to pay child support. In 1998, plaintiff brought the instant action for an increase in child support. Contesting paternity, defendant sought blood or genetic testing and vacation of the judgment, should testing confirm that defendant was not the child's father. The trial court erred in ruling that defendant was irrevocably bound by the judgment. A 1995 statutory amendment with retroactive application added a blood or genetic test basis upon which a court could vacate a paternity judgment. The amendment's retroactive effect did not impair vested rights. The order denying the motion was vacated and the case remanded for the parties to submit to testing. If the tests excluded defendant's paternity, the court was to consider whether the paternity judgment should be vacated.</SPAN></P>

The court also had to decide whether it was reversible error not to provide notice of a Stewards' hearing to appellee, the owner of the horse. On appeal, the court decided that appellant did not apply the absolute insurer rule to appellee, and that appellant could disqualify the horse and deny appellee the purse monies where the horse raced with an impermissible drug in its body. It was of no consequence how the drug was administered to the horse.

The court held that: (1) because appellant's uncontradicted testimony was that the cocaine was not found on his person and appellant was not contesting the validity of the warrant but only the search of his person, the cocaine was not properly the subject of the suppression motion and should not have been suppressed; (2) any error regarding the suppression of the currency was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, as it was merely cumulative evidence in light of the 36 bags of cocaine; and (3) the unchallenged presentence investigation report was sufficient to sustain the state's burden of proving appellant's prior conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged judgment of the Washington County (Maryland) Circuit Court, which declared that appellee may use medically reasonable force in the future to prevent harm to appellant from his self-imposed hunger strike.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, an inmate at a correctional institute, had been on a hunger strike from which he voluntarily drank nutritional supplements. However, upon his transfer to another facility, medical staff refused to provide him the supplements he previously received. Subsequently, appellant lost consciousness due to weight loss, and a temporary restraining order was granted allowing tube feeding of appellant. Upon appellant's return to a sufficient weight, feeding tubes were removed and appellant began drinking liquid supplements. However, trial court entered declaratory judgment allowing appellee to use medically reasonable force in the future to prevent harm to appellee from further weight loss. The court, reviewing circumstances surrounding the case, as well as prior analogous case law, held no controversy existed at the declaratory judgment hearing and the issue was moot, as appellant was maintaining a minimum weight by drinking liquid nutritional supplements. Court then followed general rule that precluded decisions on constitutional issues when a controversy no longer existed, and held trial court erred in granting declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment was reversed, as claim at issue was non-justiciable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant filed a complaint against appellees, alleging violations of her civil rights, various state torts, and other claims. Appellees filed motions to dismiss asserting that the complaint failed to state a cause of action.

Appellees then filed motions to dismiss or in the alternative for summary judgment, and some moved to strike the affidavit. The motions to strike the affidavit and motions to dismiss were granted. Appellant sought review, arguing that the court erred in dismissing the following claims: Title VII discrimination claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000, claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and equal protection claims under Md. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 24, false imprisonment claims, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 13981 claims, intentional infliction of emotional distress, aiding and abetting, and civil conspiracy claims.

Appellant was subsequently charged and convicted of criminal trespass pursuant to Md. Ann.

On appeal, the court vacated the trespass conviction upon a finding that appellant held an objectively reasonable belief that he was allowed to be present as long as he did so by invitation of a resident of the complex. Appellant's reasonable belief was not diminished by the fact that he and the person extending the invitation were minors nor by the fact that the complex was a public facility. Thus, appellant's arrest was unlawful and he was justified in resisting; however, the cause was remanded for a determination of whether the force exerted by appellant in resisting arrest was reasonable or excessive.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review, and the court affirmed. The court first rejected appellant's claim that the process was not a trade secret because the necessary components were all available on the open market and because the fundamental underlying concept was widely known in the plastics industry, holding that those facts were not dispositive. The court further rejected appellant's claim that the process belonged to him and not to appellee corporation, noting that a trade secret was part of a corporation's assets and was the property of the corporation. The court then affirmed the award of attorney fees to appellee, holding that appellant's misappropriation was willful and malicious, and therefore, appellee was entitled to fees; and also held that appellee was entitled to the fees incurred in the instant appeal.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued on appeal that the trial court had erred when it failed to grant appellant a requested evidentiary hearing. The appellate court found that the trial court had erred in concluding that only appellant's surviving parent's rights were at stake in the guardianship proceeding. The court found that appellant's liberty interest in his relationship with his father was also at stake. For that reason, the court found that appellant was constitutionally entitled to an opportunity to be heard on the question of whether the guardianship would be in his best interest, even though he was not entitled to consent to it.

The trial court found that the Order was a valid exercise of the department's authority. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment holding that the Order was not required to be promulgated according to the Howard County Administrative Procedure Act (Act), Md. &sect; 2.1000. According to the appeals court, pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 729A, the county police department could promulgate reasonable regulations with respect to secondary employment, although it could not prohibit secondary employment. In addition, the appeals court held that the Order was not a rule under the Act because the Order was concerned with internal management and the internal operating procedures of the police department. The appeals court held that the Order did not affect the rights of the public or the procedures available to the public. Moreover, the court held that in the absence of statutory direction or regulation the power to maintain and operate a police system carried with it the right and duty to exercise reasonable discretion in its maintenance.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that Md. Code Ann. Tax-Gen. &sect; 11-601(d)(1)(1988, 1997 Repl. Vol., 1998 Supp.), unambiguously imposed liability on certain specified corporate officers, including vice presidents such as appellant, regardless of their actual ability to control the fiscal management of the corporation. Appellant was authorized to unilaterally endorse corporate checks and to handle corporate finances, even though the evidence showed he did not do so. Under the rational relationship test, the statute did not violate appellant's substantive due process rights as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. XIV or the Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant borrowed money from appellee loan association on certain real property.

Appellee filed an action for forcible entry and detainer, and the trial court ordered appellant to deposit into the court's escrow account monthly rental payments, during the eviction proceedings, and ordered appellee to post a bond for damages. Both parties challenged the trial judge's ruling, and the court held that even though there was no formal landlord-tenant relationship between the parties, appellee could proceed with its forcible entry and detainer action. The court determined that this action was based on common British law, which did not require a formal agreement. However, the court reversed the trial court's ruling that appellee was required to post a bond, because the bond requirement was strictly statutory in nature and could only be imposed upon a formal landlord.

The trial court entered judgment for plaintiffs and denied defendants' motions requesting application of the statutory cap on noneconomic damages set forth in Md. Code Ann. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 11-108. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the case. The court held that the burden of proof was on plaintiffs to prove that their injuries arose prior to the effective date of the statutory cap on damages. The court held further that plaintiffs presented no evidence that the asbestos-related diseases came into existence prior to the effective date of the statutory cap. In addition, the court held that the statutory cap was constitutional. The court held that because the legislature authorized a jury trial to determine the facts with regard to liability, but the statute itself fixed the damages, there was no interference with the constitutional right to a jury trial. The court held further that a plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to meet the &quot;proximity, frequency, and regularity&quot; test with respect to inhalation of defendant's product.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted at trial that he had a reasonable belief that he was entitled to enter the premises in question. Defendant appealed the conviction, and the court affirmed. The court held that while the state was entitled to the Thayer-Wigmore presumption that defendant did not possess a reasonable belief that he could enter the house, defendant could assert a defense that he had such a reasonable belief. The court held, however, that defendant failed to successfully assert the defense because it was not reasonable for defendant to believe he was entitled to intrude into the home of a third person to look for the fugitive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to trial, defendant filed a motion to suppress a search warrant. Defendant asserted that the search was not based on probable cause. Testimony was also heard regarding suppression of the pretrial photographic identification on the ground that it was impermissibly suggestive. The motion was denied and defendant was subsequently convicted. Upon review, defendant sought review of whether the search warrant was supported by probable cause, whether the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction, and whether it was error to deny motions for a mistrial that concerned objectionable testimony from two police officers. The court held that defendant had failed to raise the sufficiency of the evidence issue as to the armed robbery and the murder and as such, had not preserved the sufficiency challenge. Further, the court held that the officer who procured the search warrant acted in objective good faith and the in-court and pretrial identifications were more than sufficient for a rational trier of fact to determine that defendant committed the armed robbery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city enacted an ordinance which defined adult businesses, established where they could be located, and required that they be licensed.

The parties improperly merged these separate concepts in their analysis of the rules pertaining to nonconforming uses. The licensing ordinance regulated establishments based on the type of business they conduct, while the zoning regulated establishments based on location. The court considered the distinction between these concepts to be critical, and held that the property did not lose its nonconforming use status accorded under zoning laws simply by its failure to comply with a licensing law. the court agreed, however, with the city's contention that even if the property owner retained its right to a nonconforming use, it was nonetheless required to comply with subsequently enacted licensing provisions regulating such use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1991, a former employee of the corporation filed a complaint of alleged employment discrimination with the commission. An investigation was undertaken, and almost five years later, a statement of charges was filed against the corporation. In response, the corporation sought a declaratory judgment that Montgomery County, Md., Code (Code) &sect;&sect; 27 et seq., violated the federal and state constitutions and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. On the parties' motions for summary judgment, the trial court denied the corporation's request for a declaratory judgment and declared Code &sect;&sect; 27-17 through 27-26 were not invalid or unenforceable. On review, the corporation asserted the trial court erred in not declaring Code &sect;&sect; 27-17 through 27-26 in conflict with state law, in finding the corporation was required to exhaust administrative remedies, and in ruling the corporation's federal claims were not ripe for review. On review, the court found the trial court erred only in failing to declare that Code &sect;&sect; 27-7 and 27-25 conflicted with state law because, to the extent that &sect;&sect; 27-7 and 27-25 authorized the commission to award monetary relief in addition to back pay, they conflicted with state law.</SPAN></P>

Health Occ. &sect; 30313(9), was not unconstitutionally vague because the term &quot;professionally incompetent&quot; was commonly understood by members of the chiropractic community, (2) the board was free judge the evidence before it and there was sufficient evidence to support the finding that the chiropractor was incompetent in his record making and keeping practices, (3) the board's liaison had not participated in ex parte communication with the board and the board's counsel's communication with the board did not constitute participation in the contested case, (4) the board's reference to other patients' records did not prejudice the chiropractor, (5) the board had statutory authority to place conditions on the chiropractor's probation, and (6) Md.

The trial court held that the fireman's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 constitutional rights had been violated and granted him a judgment for loss of consortium. The court reversed, and held that the suspended fireman held no constitutionally protected property interest in actually performing his job and his procedural due process rights were not violated while suspended because he continued to receive his pay and benefits. The court reasoned that an employee held a protected property interest only in the economic benefits of his employment and that an employee's property interest in his continued employment was properly safeguarded by payment of full salary and fringe benefits during his suspension.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The first case against the juvenile arose from an altercation that ensued after he took a sandwich from the school cafeteria and the second arose from a drug transaction. The court affirmed the juvenile's adjudication as a delinquent. The court held that the prohibitions in Md.

The court held that a rational trier of fact could have reasonably determined that the juvenile had willfully or knowingly obtained unauthorized control over the second lunch with the purpose of depriving the school of the lunch and had thus committed theft. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to establish that the juvenile had conspired to constructively possess the cocaine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The franchisee alleged that the competing franchise permitting the construction of subways and pipelines was adopted in violation of procedural requirements in the city charter and was not authorized by the state public service commission. The franchisee contended that it had standing based on the property interest in its city-granted franchise to challenge the alleged illegal and unauthorized competition by the utility firm and its affiliate. On appeal, the court held that the franchisee had standing both to challenge the validity of the competing franchise and to seek an injunction against the utility firm and its affiliate for failing to obtain authorization from the public service commission. The court found that the non-exclusive franchise granted by the city constituted a property interest that was both cognizable and sufficient to confer the franchisee with standing to contest the alleged violation of the city charter. The court further held that the franchisee as a public service company had a sufficient interest in avoiding competition to challenge the city's approval of a competing franchise as an alleged violation of the Maryland Public Service Commission Law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Maryland Securities Division (securities division) brought an administrative action against appellee securities dealer for fraud in the offer and sale of unregistered securities in violation of the Maryland Securities Act (act), Md.

After a hearing, appellant securities commissioner (commissioner) affirmed the denial of the motion to dismiss, found that appellees had violated the act, and imposed a fine. The circuit court reversed on the ground that the securities division's action was brought more than one year from the date of the alleged violations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of criminal contempt for failure to make child support payments and sentenced to 180 days of imprisonment. The court affirmed the judgment, rejecting defendant's contention that he was entitled to a trial by a jury. Under federal constitutional law, a defendant facing imprisonment in excess of 180 days had a right to a trial by jury. With respect to criminal contempt, where there was no maximum authorized penalty, the actual sentence determines whether a defendant had a federal constitutional right to a jury trial. Neither the Maryland Constitution, nor Md. R. Other Special Proceedings 15-205(f), which applied the jury trial provisions of Md. R. Crim. Causes 4-246 to all constructive criminal contempt proceedings, provided defendant with a right to a jury trial. Rule 4-246 only applied when, by operation of law, the defendant had a right to a jury trial. Finally, though a defendant charged with criminal contempt in the district court was entitled to a jury trial where an offense permitted imprisonment for a period of 90 days, a defendant convicted of criminal contempt in district court had greater rights than one so convicted in the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant employer sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland), which affirmed a decision by the Prince George's County Human Relations Commission finding that appellant illegally discharged appellee ex-employee in retaliation for a complaint filed by appellee alleging discrimination. Pursuant to Prince George's County, Md. Code &sect; 2-195.01, appellee was awarded damages for back pay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee ex-employee filed an action for employment discrimination against appellant employer with the Princes George's County Human Relations Commission, claiming that he was discharged in retaliation for filing a discrimination complaint. Subsequently, pursuant to Prince George's County, Md., Code &sect;2-195, the Commission awarded appellee damages for back pay, embarrassment, and humiliation. The trial court affirmed, and appellant sought review, arguing that Prince George's County, Md. Code &sect; 2-195 was unconstitutional because it allowed damages for employment discrimination in excess of such damages provided for under state law. The court reversed the award of damages for embarrassment and humiliation and vacated the award of damages for back pay. The court held that Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, &sect; 11(e) expressly stated that any award of monetary relief for back pay was limited to a 36-month period. Thus, state law provided for damages for back pay in an amount less than that provided for in Prince George's County, Md. Code &sect; 2-195. Because &sect; 2-195.01 permitted monetary relief in excess of the maximum established by state law, it conflicted with Md. Ann. Code &sect; 49B, &sect; 11(e).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the grant of damages and back pay to appellee ex-employee on his employment discrimination action against appellant employer. The court held that the local statute providing for back pay was unconstitutional because it was preempted by a state statute which limited the period for which back pay could have been awarded. Thus, an award for back pay under the local ordinance exceeded that allowed by the state statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A zoning board granted appellant property owners' application for an area variance to construct a swimming pool adjacent to their home. Appellee chairman petitioned for judicial review. The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland) reversed the board's grant of the variance for the swimming pool, finding that the board's decision was not supported by substantial evidence regarding all of the ordinance requirements. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Although the applicable critical areas regulatory scheme prohibited the construction of pools within the extended critical area buffer, the owners obtained a variance. However, the trial court found that the owners were not entitled to a variance. The court affirmed, holding that the board's grant of the variance as to the owners' swimming pool proposal was arbitrary and capricious because there was no substantial evidence to support the board's findings as to each of the ordinance requirements for the grant of the variance. Basically, depriving the owners of a swimming pool did not amount to an unwarranted hardship. Moreover, the absence of a pool, by virtue of the application of the critical areas buffer requirements and prohibitions, did not amount to a constitutionally cognizable taking on the record. Finally, there was no evidence bearing on which (if any) of the owners' neighbors, with waterfront or non-waterfront properties, had swimming pools. Without some substantial, material, and credible evidence bearing on these matters, the board's conclusions were arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county commissioners argued that state law did not preempt the county's right to regulate sewage sludge storage facilities. In short, the commissioners' contended that the sewage sludge part, Md. Code Ann., Envir. &sect; 9-230 through 9-249, did not preempt Queen Anne County, Md., Zoning Ordinance &sect;&sect; 4002 and 7203(C), which made the erection of a sewage sludge storage facility a conditional use. The corporations claimed that the general assembly's enactment of a comprehensive, ubiquitous statutory sewage sludge scheme manifested its intent to preempt regulation of the field. Thus, the corporations contended that even if the zoning ordinance did not expressly conflict with state law, it still was preempted by implication; therefore the zoning ordinance was of no effect. The circuit court found that the legislature had impliedly preempted the field. The court declined to affirm the circuit court because it concluded that the legislature did not intend to preempt the field in regard to traditional zoning matters, such as the location of sewage sludge storage facilities. Rather, the court believed that the legislature intended to complement, not supplant local zoning law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the trial court's award of summary judgment to the corporations and remanded the case to the circuit court for further proceedings. The court ordered the corporations to pay costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant brought an action against a police officer, the city council, and the court commissioner for unlawful arrest and incarceration. Appellant had been charged with hindering two undercover police officers in the performance of their duties. The charges resulted from appellant's public disclosure that the officers were undercover narcotic agents. The trial court found probable cause existed to believe appellant had committed the offense of hindering and therefore appellant's arrest and incarceration were proper. Appellant appealed from the decision arguing his constitutional right to free speech had been violated. The reviewing court found appellant was unlawfully arrested for the crime of hindering and the arrest violated appellant's constitutional rights to free speech. Appellant's public statement that an officer's occupation was a narcotics agent did not constitute an act of hindering because appellant did not have the knowledge the officer was in the course of performing her duties. Thus, appellant was arrested in violation of his constitutional rights to free speech. The court vacated the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court's judgment, finding that the trial court improperly substituted its judgment for the Agency's decision. The court held that the Agency applied the correct principles of law under the Maryland CPA because Md. Code Ann., Com.

The court concluded that substantial evidence supported the Agency's conclusion that lack of disclosure about the details of the retailer's travel offer was an unfair and deceptive trade practice under the Maryland CPA because it was material to any consumer and the offer was conditioned upon purchase of appliances from the retailer's store. The retailer was subject to the notice provisions of the Maryland CPA because its ad did not offer any savings on consumer goods or services.</SPAN></P>

The city appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland), which granted appellee vehicle owner's motion to dismiss the action on the ground that the drugs were illegally seized from the vehicle and could not be admitted as evidence in the forfeiture action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">City police seized the vehicle and drugs were found inside the vehicle during a search. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in applying the exclusionary rule and excluding the evidence of controlled substances and related packaging in the vehicle that was subject to the forfeiture action. The court found that the state general assembly intended for &sect; 297 to be a civil in rem proceeding. The court found that there was no clear proof that the statutory scheme was punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate that legislative intention. The court stated that &sect; 297 used the civil standard of proof, the forum was a civil court, and a criminal act was not a precondition for a forfeiture. The court held that the exclusionary rule did not apply to a civil in rem forfeiture proceeding pursuant to &sect; 297. The court stated that the forfeiture statute for vehicles transporting drugs under Md. Ann.

Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 9-104 (1976 &amp; Repl. Vol. 1996) to the purchasers. The purchasers had not yet closed on the property. The lumberyard filed a petition for a mechanics' lien, which the court denied pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Real. Prop. &sect; 9-106(b)(2) (1976 &amp; Repl. Vol. 1996), finding no genuine dispute of material fact. The lumberyard appealed. The court affirmed, holding that although the purchasers became equitable owners of the property when they entered into the builder's agreement, the builder retained legal title. Thus, the court held that a mechanics' lien could not be enforced against the property because the purchasers were not parties to the contract between the builder and the lumberyard to furnish materials. The court also found that any error in not enforcing the lien because the lumberyard failed to comply with Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 9-104 (1976 &amp; Repl. Vol. 1996) was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During a heated discussion with a bank employee regarding an error in his account, defendant threatened to blow up the bank. He was convicted pursuant to &sect; 151A. On appeal, he argued that the state's evidence was not legally sufficient to show that he had any criminal intent, and that the trial judge erroneously permitted the state to call a certain rebuttal witness. The court reluctantly affirmed the conviction. The court found that while it would not have been persuaded by the evidence it nonetheless satisfied the state's burden of production. The court found that if defendant had claimed that he was charged with the wrong crime he might have prevailed. The evidence did not fit the crime charged and, therefore, was legally insufficient. The inappropriateness, and therefore the inadequacy, of the evidence to show a violation of &sect; 151A was squarely raised and argued at the trial level. However, defendant failed to raise the argument on appeal, and it could not have arisen by implication. Regarding the rebuttal witness, the court held that the trial court had not abused its discretion because the admission of her testimony was not &quot;manifestly wrong&quot; or &quot;substantially injurious.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The victims were awarded judgments against the various appellants, who appealed the judgments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellants claimed insufficient evidence, improper and inadequate jury instructions regarding duties to warn, and consolidation of the trial violated Md. R. Civ. P., Cir. Ct. 2-503 and due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that consolidation of the asbestos cases was proper under Md. R. Civ. P., Cir. Ct. 2-503 and there was sufficient evidence to support the verdicts of the victims, who proved actual exposure to the products containing asbestos, but not as to those victims who had failed to prove they were exposed to asbestos. The court further held that the manufacturers and suppliers were liable to the victims based upon the evidence that there existed publications at the time that the products were marketed that provided the manufacturers and suppliers with information of the dangers of asbestos, but that the victims whose claims pre-dated the existence of those materials could not recover. The court further held that the manufacturers and suppliers were strictly liable to the victims once it was proven that the products were dangerous and they failed to warn the consumers of the danger.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, because the victims, spouses, and representatives were required to prove the victims were exposed to products containing asbestos that were marketed by the manufacturers and suppliers, who had knowledge or should have known that the products contained asbestos and the asbestos was dangerous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">County enacted an ordinance that ordered all surplus money from a foreclosure sale, within 10 years of purchase, to be placed in the county's housing initiative fund. The court determined that in the absence of state legislation giving county's inchoate claims specific priority over other judgments creditors, county could not by local ordinance give to itself senior status. County was preempted from asserting the provisions of a local ordinance that provided for a priority of liens that was in direct conflict with portions of the Maryland Code, Maryland Rules of Procedure, and Maryland case law. Therefore lien holder's perfected security interest in the surplus funds was superior to that of county's. Therefore, the trial court erred in denying lien holder the requested relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Howard County (Maryland) that convicted him of battery in connection with a courtroom brawl that erupted during domestic proceedings before a circuit court master. Defendant argued that his attorney's ability to present a defense was erroneously restricted, that the jury received incorrect instructions, and that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant struck a sheriff's deputy after a court-appointed master ordered him taken into custody when he was held in contempt during a hearing about his child support obligation. The court held that the arrest was illegal and that the jury should have been instructed on resisting arrest. The deputies were not authorized to arrest defendant because he committed no crime in their presence. The master's recommendations of contempt and immediate incarceration were subject to review and implementation by a circuit court judge, and Md. R. Civ. P., Cir. Ct. 2-541(c) did not give the master express or implied authority to arrest a litigant pending judicial review of his recommendations. Defendant's detention was not analogous to an arrest made pursuant to a flawed warrant issued by a judicial officer because it was based on a master's unlawful order, and the deputies' good faith belief in the master's authority did not transform the illegal arrest into a legal one. Defendant was entitled to an instruction on the privilege of using reasonable force to resist an unlawful arrest, the omission of which may have infected the jury's decision on the battery charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's battery conviction was vacated because he did not receive the jury instruction on resisting arrest to which he was entitled. The trial court was directed to instruct the jury on remand that defendant's arrest was illegal and that he had the right to use reasonable force to resist an unlawful arrest so that the jury could determine whether the force that defendant used was excessive or reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The gaming commission cited the licensee for violations of the gaming rules and regulations, and sought to impose a fine and suspend its license. The licensee filed an action in the circuit court seeking a declaration that &sect; 255C created a misdemeanor; that the district court had exclusive original jurisdiction to hear charges against the licensee involving a violation of &sect; 255C; and that the hearing procedures were in violation of the licensee's due process rights and, therefore, unconstitutional. The circuit court granted the licensee's motion for summary judgment and entered the aforementioned declaration. The court held that the circuit court's conclusion that fines imposed pursuant to Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 255C(r) (1957) were criminal sanctions was erroneous. The court stated that the scheme of disciplinary enforcement imposed by an administrative body applying procedural rules and a standard of proof utterly inconsistent with criminal prosecutions clearly indicated that the fines were civil rather than criminal fines.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant employee asserted a claim against appellees, employer and individuals, based on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000e et seq., the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, tort claims, and state constitutional violations. The Circuit Court for Cecil County (Maryland) granted the employer and individuals' motions for dismissal and summary judgment. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee, a female correctional officer at a county facility, filed an action against her employer and against her superiors individually, alleging that she was harassed and subjected to different working conditions than her male counterparts. The court held that the action was properly dismissed against the individuals because although the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit imposed individual liability under Title VII, the court was not bound by that precedent and it found the reasoning of other jurisdictions to be more persuasive. Although the employer was not specifically named in the employee's Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charge, her Title VII claim could proceed because it fell under the identity of interest exception. Her sexual harassment claims failed for lack of evidence, but her gender discrimination claims remained viable. The &sect; 1983 claim was also viable because the employer was a local official for the purposes of that statute. Her negligent hiring and the intentional infliction of emotional distress claims both failed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the dismissal of the Title VII claim against the individuals, but reversed the dismissal of the Title VII claims against the employer. The dismissal of the claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and the state constitution was reversed. The summary judgments in favor of the employer on the negligent hiring/retention and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that her conviction was invalid because the state unconstitutionally exercised peremptory challenges solely on the basis of age. The court disagreed and affirmed the conviction. After defense counsel noted that all of the state's peremptory challenges had been exercised against prospective jurors who were black, the prosecutor stated that she was striking all jurors around age 30 and under. The challenges were race-neutral, so they did not violate Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 8-102 or the Sixth Amendment. Additionally, because peremptory challenges based on age classifications are subject to &quot;rational basis&quot; review, they are not forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court deferred to the trial court's determination that the state's peremptories were not racially motivated. The extensive circumstantial evidence produced at trial was legally sufficient to sustain the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were involved in a computer sales fraud scheme. Both the State and the Federal Government charged defendants for crimes arising out of these offenses. On appeal, however, a federal appellate court reversed that trial court's deviation from the recommended sentence based on the indictments since the crimes alleged by the State in its indictment occurred after defendants were indicted in federal court. Thus, defendant's were resentenced, but because the resentencing occurred after defendants should have been released under their new sentence, defendants were forced to spend extra time in jail as a result of the State's involvement in their federal prosecution. The State's indictments against defendants had previously been used to enhance sentences for federal convictions in the District of Columbia. Defendants claimed that subsequent prosecution by the State under their indictments violated the double jeopardy clause. The court held that use of the State's indictments to enhance the sentence for defendant's federal conviction was not &quot;punishment&quot; under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant partnership instituted a declaratory judgment action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland) claiming that appellee county improperly assessed a transfer tax in the amount of $ 83,840.00, and then unconstitutionally imposed a lien on partnership's property when it refused to pay the tax. The circuit court concluded that appellant failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and dismissed the suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Subsequent to a series of conveyances partnership acquired title to an estate for years in a parcel of land and fee simple title to the improvements on the land. When the confirmatory deed was recorded, county determined that no local transfer tax was due, and stamped the confirmatory deed as required. County then completed forms which stated that there was a tax deficiency for the conveyance and county denied the recording of the deed. County then assessed a transfer tax and imposed a lien for unpaid taxes on the land and improvements. Partnership did not pay the tax. Instead, partnership filed a declaratory relief action which the trial court dismissed. The court determined that the lower court erred in dismissing partnership's action because it determined that Md. Code Ann., Tax. Gen. &sect; 3-103 did not create an administrative remedy that partnership could have exhausted prior to the commencement of litigation challenging the tax. The court found that the administrative remedies that had been created for refund actions were not applicable or exclusive. The refund scheme did not bar partnership's right to pursue appropriate relief in the lower court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the lower court's order dismissing the case and remanded the matter to the lower court for further proceedings consistent wit the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The church trustees sought declaratory relief. The lower court granted the former pastor's motion to dismiss the complaint as a stay pending arbitration. The court vacated the lower court's decision. Procedurally, the court determined that the lower court's decision was appealable because the lower court had the discretion to certify the judgment as a final order. That was so because the former pastor's claim could have been brought in a separate proceeding. Moreover, there was no just reason to delay the appeal. Substantively, the court held that the former pastor did not hold a valid election because he did not comply with the church constitution's requirement that special meetings be called one week prior to the election and that members of the church be notified three days prior to the meeting. Thus, the dispute did not concern the fair conduct of an election and was not subject to &sect; 5-310's mandate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The psychiatric patient was involuntarily committed to a state facility. An administrative law judge found him to present a danger to his life or safety or to the life or safety of others.

The patient appealed to the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH). The OAH affirmed the CRP's decision. The trial court affirmed the OAH's decision, and the patient was forcibly medicated and discharged to a community residential program. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision. The court held that: (1) it would consider the case although the controversy between the parties was moot, because the forced administration of medication clearly concerned a relationship between the government and its citizens and was a matter of important public concern; and (2) Md. Code Ann. Health-Gen. &sect;10-708(g)(3)(i) required that the CRP determine that the patient was a danger to himself or others in the facility, not that the patient was a danger to himself or others upon being discharged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs' daughter was arrested while driving their vehicle, which was seized pursuant to the Maryland drug forfeiture law, Md.

In exchange for the payment, the police agreed not to recommend the car for forfeiture. Subsequently, plaintiffs filed suit against defendant officials alleging claims of fraud, conspiracy, and violations of Articles 6, 9, 19, and 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The trial court granted the officials' motion to dismiss. On review, plaintiffs contended the statute was unconstitutional as applied because officials deprived them of their right to litigate an innocent owner defense. The appeals court rejected the constitutional challenge. The court reasoned that plaintiffs were not compelled to buy back the car, but voluntarily agreed to do so. The court noted that if plaintiffs had rejected the &quot;buy back&quot; proposal, the forfeiting authority could have petitioned for forfeiture, and plaintiffs would then have been afforded notice and a hearing at which they could litigate the innocent owner defense.</SPAN></P>

Twenty years later the grantor brought an action against the grantee, seeking a declaratory judgment that title to a parcel of land had reverted to the grantor upon the closing of a school by the grantee. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the grantee as to all claims. The grantor appealed, alleging that trial court erred in determining that the grantor's possibility of reverter extinguished. The court held that no possibility of reverter existed because the grantor did not file its notice of intent to preserve a possibility of reverter. The court also held that when the fee simple determinable conveyance was made, the adverse possession of the grantee in possession began to run on the date of the determinable event, and title in fee simple absolute vested by adverse possession seven years later.</SPAN></P>

Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 297 (1996 Repl. Vol.) based upon the car possessor's alleged distribution of drugs. The police stopped him for an outstanding warrant, arrested him, and found drugs and cash in the car.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The titleholder let her son drive the car because he did not have any other transportation. The car possessor argued that the seized cash was from car repair work. The court affirmed in part as to the cash forfeiture and reversed in part as to the car forfeiture. The trial court's factual findings were not clearly erroneous. There was no evidence that the car possessor used the car to distribute drugs and there was no culpability on the part of the car as to the small amount of drugs that were in the car. The fact that the car possessor was under surveillance did not create any nexus between the car, the cash, and the drugs. He was previously convicted of a misdemeanor drug charge but there was no evidence of a long criminal record to establish culpability. The court evaluated the car forfeiture under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 297i (1996 Repl. Vol.) and it evaluated the cash forfeiture under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 297(b)(6). The cash was not automatically forfeitable. The State showed that it was in close proximity to the drugs and it was a question of fact whether the possessor rebutted the presumption of forfeitability. The car was seized as a unconstitutionally excessive fine.</SPAN></P>

The court also found, with respect to the negligence claims, the trial court found no evidence of a breach of duty, if a duty existed.

The claimant struck a bar patron as he fled in his truck. An off-duty police officer in plain clothes witnessed the incident. The officer pursued the claimant. When the claimant stopped due to a flat tire, the officer roughly detained him until a state trooper arrived. The claimant brought a civil rights action against the town pursuant to the Maryland Declaration of Rights and state tort law. Following the town's motions for summary judgment and dismissal, the trial court only dismissed some of the counts. The town sought review. The court dismissed the appeal. The refusal to grant the officer's motion was not an appealable collateral order because an inference of actual malice, which would impose liability, could reasonably be drawn by the trier of facts from facts not in dispute. As to the town, the court held that a municipality was not entitled to governmental immunity for a constitutional tort committed by one of its employees and imputed to the municipality under the doctrine of respondeat superior. Thus, both the town and officer were barred from collateral order review.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that anticipatory search warrants were invalid as a matter of law, that such warrants improperly placed the ultimate determination of probable cause in the hands of the police, and that the warrant in question was not based on probable cause. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that: (1) anticipatory search warrants were not per se unconstitutional; (2) where the police made a particularized showing that the items to be seized would be in the place to be searched at a specified time and the search could not be executed until the triggering event occurred, then it was the magistrate and not the officer who determined probable cause; and (3) the fact that the police first intercepted the package did not preclude a finding of probable cause based on a &quot;sure course to a known destination.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) assessed compensatory and punitive damages against appellant sellers for concealing from appellee purchaser certain tax information about an aviation freight company that the purchaser bought from the sellers. The judgment was entered jointly and severally against the sellers. The sellers filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties entered into an agreement to sell an aviation freight company. The sellers failed to advise the purchaser about a field audit report completed the day before the closing. After the sale, the purchasers were notified of a tax assessment. The purchaser filed an action for fraudulent misrepresentation. The circuit court awarded the purchaser compensatory and punitive damages and the sellers filed an appeal. The sellers argued that their representations were true and that purchaser failed to generate a jury issue on the element of scienter. The court affirmed the compensatory damages award. The court held that (1) the jury was entitled to infer scienter from the sellers' silence where they had a duty to disclose the field audit report, (2) the sellers' reliance on the advice of counsel did not entitled them to prevail on whether their silence was in good faith, (3) the purchaser did not receive a double recovery for the same damages because it was compensated for two different harms, and (4) the jury instructions were consistent. The court vacated the punitive damages award because a post-verdict review by the trial judge was an essential prerequisite to a valid award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the compensatory damages award assessed against a seller and vacated the punitive damages award entered in favor of the purchaser. The court remanded the case for a post-verdict review of punitive damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While working on the development of its property, the developer was informed by the county board that it would have to construct two streets on its property and that one of the streets, which would intersect an adjacent highway, would have to be dedicated as a public street. Many problems occurred during construction, including the highway department's disallowance of a crossover of the highway. Several years later the developer filed an inverse condemnation action. The trial court first invalidated a zoning regulation, from which the county board appealed. The trial court then granted the county board's summary judgment motion on statute of limitations grounds. The developer appealed. The court vacated the order invalidating the zoning regulation, and affirmed the grant of summary judgment. The statute of limitations for inverse condemnation actions was three years. The action accrued when the developer knew or should have known of circumstances that would cause a reasonable person to undertake an investigation which would have led to knowledge of the actionable wrong. In this case, the action accrued when the county board first requested the developer to construct the streets.</SPAN></P>

The trial court affirmed and the physician appealed, claiming that the peer review process violated mandatory agency regulations, and other claims not addressed. The court reversed the decision of the circuit court because the peer review process violated mandatory agency regulations. The court held that both the legislature and the board's procedures indicated that the peer review procedures, enacted by the board, were mandatory. The court held that the peer review committee failed to follow the procedures because rather than individually review the records, each member reviewed one record and made a group presentation and decision, and failed to make individual assessments of the records.

The contractor requested the labor commissioner to review the ALJ's findings with respect to the second prong of its affirmative defense. However, the labor commissioner undertook further review and determined that neither prong had been shown. The trial court affirmed the labor commissioner's ruling, and the contractor appealed. The court affirmed. The labor commissioner did not exceed his authority in reviewing a finding by the ALJ not questioned by the contractor because the labor commissioner was statutorily granted the authority to review a decision by the ALJ on his own authority, and his review comported with the requirements of due process. Further, the labor commissioner's findings with respect to the affirmative defense were not erroneous.

Appellant claimed that there was no probable cause for the search or arrest and that his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause were violated because the forfeiture proceedings were barred because of his convictions. The court affirmed the convictions for possession of cocaine and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute because there was sufficient probable cause for the arrest based on the information from the reliable confidential informant and what was witnessed. The warrantless search of the vehicle was justified because of the nearby crowd, even though appellant was restrained. The court also affirmed the forfeitures because they were civil in rem proceedings and not punitive in personam proceedings. The test to determine if the forfeitures constituted double jeopardy was that &sect; 297 was intended to be civil and that the forfeitures were not punitive in nature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband, daughter, and estate contended that the circuit court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of the health care providers on the grounds that their claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The court held that there was a factual dispute as to when the health care providers' negligence harmed or injured the decedent. According to the court, the circuit court erroneously concluded, as a matter of law, that the decedent suffered an injury in 1983 when the health care providers allegedly misdiagnosed the biopsy specimens. The court determined that because decedent did not become ill until August 1988, there was a lack of discernible effect on the decedent. Furthermore, the court held that the negligent misdiagnosis was not necessarily an injury for purposes of limitations. According to the court, the decedent did not suffer a legally cognizable harm until 1988 when the decedent suffered damages as a proximate cause of the health care providers' negligence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under a contract with the city, the non-resident agreed to pay an annual fee for water and sewer service equal to the real estate tax that it would have paid if it had been a resident. Years later, the city rejected the non-resident's claim for a refund of the fees and filed a breach of contract action to recover unpaid fees. The non-resident filed a tax court appeal. When the non-resident's motion to dismiss the contract action was denied, it filed a counterclaim for a refund. Upon the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court granted summary judgment to the city. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court ruled that because the utility service charges were not taxes, jurisdiction over the matter was proper in the trial court, not the tax court. The court ruled that the city 's obligation to provide utility services to the non-resident was purely contractual and that it could charge the non-resident higher rates than it did for residents.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A local developer requested the local zoning board to rezone his property to residential use from an open space district. The court found that a community group wrongfully stated that it was the owner of the developer's property and caused the property to be downzoned to an open space district without the true owner's knowledge. The court found that the developer's upzoning request would increase the land's economic viability. The court found that the property was privately owned, and absent an agreement to the contrary, the government could not compel a private property owner to use that property for community recreation purposes without compensating the property owner. The court held that the zoning restriction was a taking within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment because the zoning law took away the value of the developer's land and did not compensate him for the loss. The court found that the developer was entitled to the rezoning request but that the unconstitutionality of the zoning law was limited to the instant case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The agency found that the placement of a septic system on the owner's property could not be accomplished within the regulatory guidelines due to the natural characteristics of the property, and that such a system could pose a serious threat to public health and lead to water pollution. The court held that the agency's decision was supported by substantial evidence and its denial of the owner's application for a permit was not discriminatory or arbitrary. The owner had a full adversarial hearing and there was no due process violation. Further, the owner's property had not been taken within the meaning U.S. Const. amends. IV, XV, or Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 40 because his property had not been taken for public use, rather his development of it had been restricted to prevent public harm. The circuit court also properly declined to review proposals that had yet to be ruled upon by the agency. Because the circuit court was sitting for the purpose of reviewing the decision of an administrative agency under the State Administrative Procedure Act, the owner had no right to a jury trial. Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendant claimed that Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. &sect; 8-701(a) did not apply to the practice of &quot;traditional&quot; midwifery, because, when the legislature enacted 1981 Md. Laws 641, it repealed the requirement that all midwifes had to be registered nurses or licensed. She claimed that, if &sect; 8-701(a) required midwives to be registered nurses, it infringed on the constitutional right of privacy to choose an unlicensed midwife to aid in the delivery of one's baby. She also argued that her motion to suppress statements made during her arrest should have been granted. The court disagreed. The court held that (1) the legislature intended not only to retain the requirement that midwifes had to be registered nurses certified by the State Board of Nursing (board) but also to allow the board to impose other requirements by regulation; (2) Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. &sect; 8-701merely regulated who could engage in the practice of midwifery and was rationally related to the legitimate state interest of protecting the health and welfare of the mother and child; (3) the defendant's blurts did not require a Miranda warning or waiver because only compelled self-incrimination was privileged.</SPAN></P>

The lower court granted appellee's motion to dismiss the counterclaim and appellant sought review of the decision. On appeal, the court held that Md. Code Ann., Health-Gen. &sect;&sect; 18-313 and 18-320 (1984) and Md. Regs. Code tit. 10, &sect; 06.02 were legitimate exercises of the state's police power because they were sufficiently related to the furthering of public welfare. Appellee acted within the police power by destroying the ferret. The court affirmed the order granting appellee's motion to dismiss because although the destruction of the ferret was a taking, that taking merely denied appellants the right to use their property in an already prohibited manner, so it was not compensable. The destruction of the ferret, a wild animal that had bitten an individual and could have spread the rabies virus, was intended to abate a &quot;nuisance.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board undertook comprehensive rezoning to address the establishment of &quot;critical area&quot; districts mandated by the state. The property in the critical areas was to be designated as an intensely developed area (IDA), a limited development area (LDA), or a resource conservation area (RCA). The owners' property was zoned as an RCA. The board later discovered that the property should be zoned as an LDA. The board then rezoned the property. The owners brought an action challenging the rezoning, alleging that there was insufficient evidence of a mistake as to the prior zoning. The lower court affirmed the rezoning. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the lower court properly found a mistake because the board had proven by substantial evidence that its previous conclusions as to the zoning of the property were a mistake as a result of erroneous assumptions proffered to it by its staff, which led to the misapprehension that the property was required to be zoned as an RCA because of growth allocation complications. While the only issue on appeal was whether a zoning mistake was established, the court further found that the rezoning of the property was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

The court then held that because the state legislature had mandated that a county's solid waste management plan only be enacted after notice was afforded the public and a hearing was held, an amendment that had substantially changed the plan that had already been advertised and on which hearings had already been held required that new notice and a new hearing on the amendment be afforded.

On June 20, 1994, she was notified that her employment was being terminated. The former employee then filed a timely appeal of the former employer's decision to terminate her with the state agency. The ALJ granted the former employee's motion to dismiss the rejection on probation and denied the former employer's proposed rejection on probation. The circuit court reversed the ALJ's decision. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment. The court held that the ALJ's decision was affected by an error of law, as the ALJ failed to apply Md. Ann. Code art. 94, &sect; 2 (1957, Repl. Vol.) to compute the dates of the former employee's probationary period.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that costs were to be paid by the former employee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The passenger challenged the estate's use of a peremptory challenge to strike the only black juror on the panel. The estate claimed that the juror was not stricken because of her race but because she was a secretary with a spouse in home improvement and because of her age and appearance. The court denied the passenger's Batson challenge without a hearing. On appeal from the judgment for the estate, the court found that the passenger made a prima facie showing of discrimination because the only member of the protected class was stricken. However, the court noted that it was reviewing a denial of a Batson challenge and the trial court's determination that the estate's race-neutral reason for its peremptory strike was not pretextual. Because of the great deference accorded to the trial court's acceptance of the reason, the court found no error. Affirming the judgment, the court held that the passenger waived any gender-based objection to the peremptory strike by not obtaining a ruling, that evidence that the passenger was suing her late sister's estate was introduced by the passenger, and that the passenger was allowed to cross-examine the estate's expert witness for bias.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff country club challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland), which held that defendant city government properly made a tax assessment against the country club for the improvement of a parkway, even though the city government did not allow the country club to cross-examine its witness at the hearing to assess the taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city government made a public improvement of a parkway, abutting the country club's property. As a city counsel meeting, the counsel took evidence of the value of the improvement from the city's expert witnesses and made a tax assessment against the country club for the cost of the improvement. The country club made the first of 20 annual payments on the assessments and then filed suit, claiming that the assessment was illegal. The trial court denied the club's claims, and it challenged the ruling. The court held that the country club could appeal on the 19 payments yet to be made, but could not seek a refund of the payment already made, because it did not object beforehand. The court also determined that the city counsel violated the country club's rights to due process when it refused to allow it to cross-examine the city's expert witnesses at the counsel meeting. The court stated that in an adversary proceeding before an administrative board, the opportunity for reasonable cross-examination was a basic right, and even the right to call persons as adverse witnesses provides no adequate substitute.The court reversed the tax assessment, and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court, and held that the city government violated the country club's rights to due process when it refused to allow it to cross-examine the city's expert witness at a meeting to determine a tax assessment, and therefore the assessment was reversed, and the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Appellee comptroller imposed the statutory civil penalty pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 13.703.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer was a corporation engaged in selling diesel fuel. The comptroller audited the taxpayer's sales and found many gallons of under-reported diesel fuel sales on which tax was still owing pursuant to the states sales tax upon motor fuel, Md.

The taxpayer first contended that the evidence did not support the tax court's affirmance of the 50 percent penalty for the alleged fraudulent filing of false tax returns. The court held that Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 13.703 must be interpreted as requiring the comptroller to prove by clear and convincing evidence that a false return was filed with fraudulent intent. Here, there was substantial evidence in the record before the tax court to support its factual conclusion that the taxpayer filed false returns with the intent to evade paying sales taxes. The court agreed with the comptroller that the taxpayer accumulated several &quot;badges of fraud,&quot; which substantiated the imposition of the statutory civil penalty. The court found the taxpayer's contention that it was denied meaningful judicial review of the tax court's decision to be meritless.</SPAN></P>

The medical services company contended that the contract was modified by conduct, and the trial court agreed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant patient sought review from the decision by a clinical review panel to administer certain antipsychotic medications to her forcibly. The reviewing administrative law judge dismissed the appeal. The Circuit Court for Allegany County (Maryland) affirmed the order of an administrative law judge. The patient appealed and appellee, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (Department) filed a motion to dismiss the instant appeal as moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the patient had been involuntarily committed because of her mental illness she refused treatment and was forced to take antipsychotic medications. She contended on appeal that Md.

The Department claimed that the appeal was moot because the medication had already been administered to the patient. The court found the matter reviewable because 1) the forcible administration of medication to patients confined in state hospitals concerned a relationship between the government and its citizens and ensuring that the procedures did not violate due process principles was a matter of important public concern; 2) the patient habitually refused to take her prescribed medicine voluntarily in the past; 3) there was substantial evidence that the patient understood her appellate right and had the capacities, both mental and physical, to exercise it; and 4) the statute had several procedural safeguards, which satisfied constitutional due process requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Charles County (Maryland), which convicted him of reckless endangerment in violation of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 120 (1992), and possession of a machine gun for an aggressive or offensive purpose in violation of &sect; 374.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Officers accompanied a wife home to investigate her report of abuse by defendant, the wife's intoxicated husband. Defendant heard their approach, put his registered machine gun under the bedsheet, and laid down with his infant. When defendant refused to remove his hand from under the bedsheet, the officer pulled it away and discovered the gun. Defendant appealed his convictions for reckless endangerment and possession of a machine gun for aggressive or offensive purposes. The court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court held that reckless endangerment was supported by sufficient evidence that defendant was in possession and control of the ready and loaded machine gun, which was pointed at the officers and inches from his daughter. The possession conviction under the constitutional &sect;&sect; 374, 375(d) was supported by evidence that defendant appeared intoxicated, concealed a ready gun and a loaded clip within its immediate vicinity, and had been in a domestic dispute. The court held that defendant was not prejudiced by the joinder of the spousal abuse charge on which he was later acquitted and the wife's assertion of her privilege not to testify.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff property owner (owner) challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Frederick County (Maryland), which affirmed defendant Planning Commission's decision that denied the owner's application for a site plan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Planning Commission's denial was made after conducting a quasi-judicial, evidentiary hearing for final review of the owner's site plan application. In reversing, the court held that, before denying the application, the Planning Commission was required to provide the owner with &quot;reasonable changes&quot; presented in a fashion that unambiguously conveyed to the owner that he had no choice but to include the proposed changes in the site plan. In so ruling, the court held that the language of the zoning ordinance required such a proactive approach, because it stated that the Planning Commission shall &quot;require&quot; any &quot;reasonable changes,&quot; and also stated that if the changes were not made, the Planning Commission &quot;shall deny&quot; the application. Further, requiring the Planning Commission to make &quot;reasonable changes&quot; assured an orderly process and prevented the Planning Commission from having impermissibly wide discretion to reject applications. Indeed, the Planning Commission was required to approve the application unless it was clear that it did not meet the objective requirements outlined in the zoning ordinance. As such, the matter was remanded to the Planning Commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's order, which affirmed the Planning Commission's decision to deny the owner's application for a site plan, and remanded to the Planning Commission for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, state human rights commission (commission), appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland) which affirmed an order of the commission's appeal board dismissing a charge of employment discrimination that had been maintained by the commission against defendant county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A claimant filed charges with the commission against the county, alleging that the county discriminated against him by excluding him from consideration for employment as a firefighter/emergency medical technician due to a congenital color vision deficiency. The administrative law judge (ALJ) dismissed the charges because the commission failed to satisfy their burden of demonstrating that the claimant met the definition of a handicapped individual. An appeal board of the commission affirmed the ALJ's decision. The commission then filed a petition for judicial review. The circuit court affirmed the decision. The commission appealed from the judgment. The court vacated the circuit court's judgment, holding that the circuit court lacked the authority to entertain the appeal. The court noted that it was incongruous that the commission was appealing from its own final administrative decision. The court held that for a petition for judicial review by the commission to be proper under Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 10-222, it had to have been sanctioned by all nine commissioners, within whom was reposed the ultimate legal authority to pursue such review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant homeowners' association sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Carroll County (Maryland), which found in favor of appellee county commissioners on its petition for condemnation of a portion of the homeowners' association's real property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Intervenor landowners contacted the county commissioners and suggested that the county exercise its power of eminent domain in order for the landowners to be able to build a road to provide access to the landowners' proposed residential lots. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that trial court erred in upholding the condemnation because on the basis of the record, no rational inferences of a genuine public purpose were possible. The court determined that the county commission's alleged basis for condemning the property, that the property was needed for the proposed future public road, did not provide a basis upon which meaningful judicial review of the constitutionality of the condemnation proceeding could be conducted; there was no such plan of public use, much less a detailed one. The court reasoned that the county commissioners' decision to initiate condemnation was clearly and solely made to enhance the private interests of the landowners; in essence, the county was using its powers of eminent domain to give the landowners access to and through homeowners' association private property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed in favor of the homeowners' association in the action by the county commissioners for condemnation of a portion of the homeowners' association's real property.</SPAN></P>
