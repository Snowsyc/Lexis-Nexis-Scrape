<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former employee sought review of the judgment of the Fourth Judicial District for the Superior Court at Fairbanks (Alaska), which granted the summary judgment motions of appellees, governor and commissioner of labor. The trial court held that the governor and the commissioner were immune from suit against the former employee, who lost his job because he lacked the requisite residency card required under the Alaska Hire Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Alaska Hire Act, Alaska Stat. &sect; 38.40.010 et seq., required residency cards but was later declared unconstitutional. The former employee argued that the governor and commissioner's enforcement of the unconstitutional requirement subjected them to personal liability. The court held that the governor and commissioner had acted in good faith as a matter of law because at the time the employee was discharged the Act had been upheld as constitutional. The court held that the trial court was correct in holding that the governor and the commissioner were immune from liability. Despite the former employee's argument that the department of labor invaded his privacy by requiring disclosure of his social security number in order to obtain a residency card, the court held that the former employee did not have an action against the governor and the commissioner could not be liable merely because a state employee allegedly violated the former employee's constitutional rights. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that the governor and the commissioner could not reasonably have recognized that the Act's requirements were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants challenged the validity of a city land sale lottery ordinance. The superior court entered a declaratory judgment that the ordinance authorizing the lottery violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Alaska Constitutions because it required participants to have been city residents for one year preceding their applications and because participants could have filed an unlimited number of applications for any parcel of land upon payment of a nonrefundable $ 10.00 fee for each application. The superior court further declared that the ordinance violated the statute prohibiting certain forms of gambling in the state. The city appealed from the judgment. The court affirmed, holding that the ordinance was unconstitutional insofar as it required participants to have been residents of the city for one year preceding their applications. It was also unconstitutional to the extent that it granted a 5 percent reduction in the sale price of a parcel for each year of residency in the city, up to a maximum reduction of 50 percent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a gubernatorial candidate and a political party, sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Fourth Judicial District, Fairbanks, that found in favor of appellee, the State of Alaska Division of Elections, in their action that sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the denial of the candidate's application for a place on the ballot. By a prior decision, the candidate was placed on the ballot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate was placed on the ballot through a decision of the court, which held that the 3 percent petition requirement of Alaska Stat. &sect; 15.25.160 was unconstitutional. However, that was not the only relief sought by appellants. They also challenged Alaska Stat. &sect; 15.60.010(20), which defined a political party, for purposes of eligibility to participate in a primary election, as a group that had polled 10 percent of the votes cast in the preceding gubernatorial election. The trial court rejected appellants' arguments that the 10 percent requirement was invalid under the free speech and equal protection clauses of the state constitution. On appeal, the court held that the 10 percent requirement was not justified by compelling governmental interest. The standard in ballot access cases required an inquiry into whether less restrictive alternatives would have adequately protected any asserted governmental interests. The court concluded that the State failed to meet its burden of proving that the 10 percent definitional requirement impinged on the rights to vote and associate freely to the least degree possible consistent with the achievement of any compelling State goals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment with respect to the trial court's holding that the statutory 10 percent definitional requirement for political parties was not invalid under the free speech and equal protection clauses of the Alaska Constitution. The court held that the requirement was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

He also sought an injunction restraining the State from making further deductions. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the judge. In reversing on appeal, the court held that: (1) where the institution of a contributory retirement system substantially furthered a legitimate economizing purpose and no suspect classifications or fundamental rights were involved, Alaska Stat. &sect; 22.25.011 did not violate either the federal or the state equal protection clauses; (2) where any judge trying the case might have had a financial interest in the outcome, the rule of necessity applied and it was appropriate for the court to hear the case; (3) judges did not commence new &quot;terms of office&quot; for purposes of Alaska Const. art. IV, &sect; 13, upon gaining the electorate's approval in a retention election and thus as judges already in office they could not be constitutionally required to contribute to a retirement system via a salary deduction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Fourth Judicial District, Fairbanks, which affirmed a decision of appellee, a borough's board of equalization, that denied the taxpayer's claim contesting an assessment of real and personal property taxes, and an assessment of interest and penalties under Alaska Stat. &sect; 29.53.180 (Michie).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The borough found in an audit that a large amount of the taxpayer's personal and real property was not taxed in six fiscal years. The taxpayer paid under protest. It unsuccessfully appealed to the board, maintaining that the borough could not assess taxes for past years. The lower court affirmed the board's decision. On further appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment in part, reversed it in part, and remanded the case. The requirement in Alaska Stat. &sect; 29.53.150 (Michie) that the borough create a supplemental assessment roll for property not included on original assessment rolls gave the borough authority to act as it did. Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.10.120 (Michie 1962), the six-year statute of limitations for cases filed by political subdivisions, applied because the legislative intent was that it applied without regard to the type of claim. However, interest and penalties under Alaska Stat. &sect; 29.53.180 (Michie) were improper as to the real property the borough had not yet demanded these taxes as described in &sect; 29.53.180. Consequently, the taxpayer was entitled to a refund in this regard under Alaska Stat. &sect; 29.53.390 (Michie) and remand was necessary on this issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment insofar as it affirmed the imposition of penalties and interest for the taxpayer's real property.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appeal from Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, that dismissed action against appellee bank, entered judgment against appellees, permanently enjoined appellees, and adjudicated appellees liable for restitution in an action where appellant state sought to enjoin appellees from using misleading statements and omissions concerning land for construction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees made misleading statements and omissions concerning the suitability of land for residential construction. The state sought to enjoin such conduct and obtain restitution on behalf of individual lot purchasers. The state obtained a preliminary injunction and sought to add appellee bank in the action. Appellees asserted that the state was without authority to pursue common law rights of defrauded land purchasers. The state contended that the judgment in its favor was proper. The court held that the trial court erred in dismissing appellee bank from the action and in denying the state's request for prejudgment attachment of appellees' property rights. The court held that the Uniform Land Sales Practices Act, Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 34.55.004 to .046, could not be retrospectively applied but remanded for supplemental evidentiary hearings to determine if the elements of common law fraud had been met for that time period. The court also held that the trial court erred in dismissing the state's claim against appellee bank.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case to the lower court to determine whether the elements of common law fraud against appellees were met during the period that the Uniform Land Sales Practices Act did not apply.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed an action that sought an injunction against enforcement of a zoning ordinance that marked a certain area for residential uses and that restricted the operation of nonpublic schools in that area. Additionally, they sought a determination that exclusion of parochial schools contravened U.S. Const. amends. I, IV, and Alaska Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 4. The trial court ruled that the zoning ordinance did not abridge plaintiffs' rights under the state and federal constitutions. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, and upheld the constitutionality of the relevant ordinance. The court found that the city's decision to preserve the relevant area for uses less intensive than schools was based upon some rational policy, so the relevant zoning ordinance was not constitutionally impermissible as violative of plaintiffs' due process rights. Further, the court held that the duty to accommodate religion established under Alaska law was satisfied by the zoning scheme employed by the city which included provisions for areas in which parochial schools and other religious uses of land could have been located.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the rape conviction, holding that the instruction regarding the inference on general intent was not erroneous because rape was a general intent crime. The court also held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to declare a mistrial because after the victim fainted, the trial judge excused the jury, took testimony both as to what occurred and whether the jury observed the incident, and admonished the jury to disregard the incident. The court further held that under the totality of the circumstances, the victim's identification of defendant at the scene was supported by indicia of reliability that were not overborne by any suggestive influence so as to constitute an invalid identification.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state house conducted proceedings that removed its existing speaker after the organization of a multi-partisan majority caucus and selected a new speaker and reorganized its leadership and standing committee assignments. The former speaker and other members sought a declaration that the removal and replacement of the former speaker was illegal and unconstitutional. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The superior court found that the replacement was lawful. Following oral argument, the court issued an order that affirmed the superior court. It issued an opinion for an explanation of its reasoning. The court held that: (1) it was improper for a court to determine the validity of the proceeding because it would have been an unwarranted intrusion into the business of the house; (2) even though the requirements of legislative rules may have been violated, the violations were solely the business of the legislature and did not give rise to a justiciable claim; and (3) imposition of procedural rules that certain motions were considered not debatable as a matter of parliamentary law did not violate constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>

The applicant contended that the domicile requirement violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant was an attorney who resided in Seattle and was a member of the bar in both Washington and New Jersey. The court noted that Alaska Bar Rule 5(1)(a) required that an applicant for admission to the state bar be domiciled in Alaska. The court also noted that the Privileges and Immunities Clause provided that the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of the citizens of the several states. The court held in a prior case that the practice of law by qualified persons is a &quot;fundamental right&quot; protected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause. The court found that Alaska Bar Rule 5(1)(a) discriminated against nonresidents and prevented otherwise qualified applicants from becoming members of the Alaska Bar, and hence from practicing law in Alaska, solely on the basis of domicile at the time of registration for admission. The Alaska Bar Association did not demonstrate a relationship between familiarity with &quot;local practice&quot; or &quot;local issues&quot; and legal competence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor's staff privileges were suspended because his activities and professional conduct were deemed disruptive of hospital operations. The medical staff governed itself at the hospital throughout the use of its by-laws. The hospital's by-laws contained two summary suspension procedures. The hospital claimed that they were interchangeable. In its determination, the court noted that rules of contract construction were applicable. The court found that the procedures were not interchangeable and that the one using summary suspension without a pre-suspension hearing, applied only when a need for immediate action in the best interests of patient care existed. The court found that such procedure required the hospital to identify the patients whose care was adversely affected and that the burden then shifted to the doctor to establish that the hospital's decision was unjustified. In weighing the competing interests, the court noted that the hospital privileges were a property interest. The court found that the summary suspension was not justified because no threat to patient care was shown. The court reversed the trial court's decision and remanded for a redetermination of damages.</SPAN></P>

The complaint also sought a refund of all assessments paid by the fishermen and a permanent injunction to restrain future collection of the assessments. The trial court granted the fishermen partial summary judgment and held &sect; 16.10.530 unconstitutional. The trial court also certified the suit as a class action. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that: (1) assessments under &sect; 16.10.530 were an exercise of the taxing power, the purpose of which was to raise revenue to construct hatcheries; (2) nothing in Alaska Const. art. VIII granted the legislature the power to ignore other express constitutional limitations on its taxing power just because it was legislating in an area that concerned natural resources, such as aquaculture; (3) &sect; 16.10.530 impermissibly delegated the taxing power to regional associations, violating Alaska Const. art.

The municipality appealed the injunction under &sect;&sect; 09.25.110, 09.25.120 that provided the newspaper access to the names and resumes of applicants for police chief.

The city enacted Ordinance No. 588, which prohibited waiters, waitresses, and entertainers in establishments serving alcohol from exposing their genitals, buttocks, and, in the case of females, their breasts. The dancer brought an action, before the law became effective, seeking a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was facially unconstitutional and an order permanently enjoining the city from enforcing it.

The court rejected the city's argument that it had the power to prohibit nude dancing in establishments where alcohol was served because the Alaska Constitution contained no clause similar to U.S. Const. amend XXI., which might have justified prohibiting otherwise protected forms of expression where liquor was sold.

The insurer expressly denied any obligation to defend, but authorized agency to retain its choice of counsel and agreed to pay 50 percent of fees and costs along with any civil damages that arose from the case. Applying the standard that the scope of an insurer's duty to defend was determined by construing the terms of the insurance contract in reference to the allegations in the complaint, the court believed that the state's action did not constitute a claim for damages, and that the insurance policy suggested that it was designed to insure against traditional tort claims for damages brought by private individuals alleging specific acts of employee misconduct. Moreover, the exclusions of any fraudulent, dishonest act, or wilful violations of any applicable statute, were such as to put insurer on notice that the state's suit did not come within the coverage.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers in each appeal refused, on the basis of constitutional privilege, to provide any information on their state income tax returns regarding the amount or source of income. The taxpayers then refused to comply with an administrative summons issued under Alaska Stat. &sect; 43.05.040, ordering them to appear and testify regarding their tax liability and to produce records pertinent to determining their tax liability. The single taxpayer and one of the married taxpayers refused to comply and were jailed for civil contempt. The state sought review of the superior court's decision to grant the married taxpayer's motion for reconsideration and decision that the married taxpayers were entitled to refuse to comply with the summons based on Fifth Amendment grounds. The single taxpayer sought review of the civil contempt order against him. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded both judgments. The court held that it was an illegal effort to stretch the Fifth Amendment to include a taxpayer who wished to avoid filing a return. The court found that the state had a compelling interest justifying the invasion of privacy in requiring the taxpayers to provide the information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In this consolidated appeal, appellant applicants challenged separate judgments of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, First Judicial District, which affirmed decisions by appellee Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission (CFEC) refusing to consider the applicants' late applications for limited entry permits. The applicants had been eligible to apply during the initial application period, but had not filed applications during that period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The CFEC administered a system of limited entry into Alaska's commercial fisheries, established in 1973 by the Limited Fisheries Entry Act (Act), Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 16.43.010-16.43.380. The original Act limited permit applicants to those commercial fish harvesters who held &quot;gear licenses&quot; prior to January 1, 1973. Both applicants were eligible, but did not apply during the initial three-month application period. In 1976, the Alaska Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the January 1, 1973 cut-off period. The Act was amended to address the deficiency, and the CFEC established a new application period for those who had fished with gear licenses for the first time during 1973 or 1974. The applicants filed applications during the new period and were rejected, as they had not been issued gear licenses for the first time during 1973 or 1974. They argued that the decision voiding the January 1, 1973 cut-off date was retroactive, so the entire original application process was void; thus the application process should have been re-opened to all. The court disagreed, holding that its previous opinion did not compel the CFEC to consider applications beyond the administratively-set deadlines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments of the superior court, which affirmed decisions by the CFEC refusing to consider late applications for limited entry permits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fisherman failed to apply for a limited fisheries permit when the program was implemented, but attempted to apply for a permit when a supplemental application period was created for individuals who had been wrongfully denied a right to apply during the initial period even though she had not applied during the earlier application period. The Commission denied the application without hearing because it determined that she was not within the disadvantaged group. The trial court upheld the Commission's action because the applicant did not have a due process ground for a hearing since the grant of a permit was an expectancy rather than a property interest. The fisherman asserted that she had a property interest in the grant of the permit because she had other required licenses and had missed the initial application period because of confinement in a mental facility. The court affirmed the decision that upheld the Commission denial, and held that while the fisherman had due process rights in the permit process there was no right to a hearing since there were no substantial and material issues which required a hearing with respect to the application.</SPAN></P>

The housing authority cross-appealed, alleging that the property owners' claims were barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to their &quot;repurchase preference rights,&quot; the property owners submitted a detailed proposal for a redevelopment project and an estimate of the cost. The housing authority rejected their bid and awarded the contract to another developer. The property owners brought an action for damages representing lost profits. The housing authority filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court adopted a new rule holding that in exchange for the property owners' investment of the time and resources involved in bid preparation, the housing authority was held to an implied promise to consider the bids honestly and fairly. The court further determined that a breach of the implied contract by the housing authority entitled the property owners to recover the costs incurred in preparation of the bid. Finally, because there was no reasonable basis for the housing authority's decision, which was based on a numerical analysis in which the numerical result was produced by an arithmetical error, the court concluded that the property owners' had made out a prima facie case for recovery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for the trial court to determine whether the property owners were entitled to recover the expenses incurred in preparing their bid. The court declined to reach the issue of sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The protestors participated in a sit-in demonstration in an abortion clinic and refused to leave when told to do so by the building security supervisor. The court held that Anchorage, Alaska, Municipal Code &sect; 8.30.010(B)(3), which required that a trespasser be requested to depart from the premises by an &quot;owner or occupant&quot; before a violation of that ordinance occurred, included a duly authorized agent acting within the scope of employment. The court rejected the protestors' claims of defense of necessity and defense of others, holding that these defenses did not apply to protests against legal abortions. The court noted that defense of others was a response to the perceived use of unlawful force, pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 11.81.330(a) and 11.81.340. Because legal abortions did not involve unlawful force, the court held that the protestors were not justified in violating the law in an attempt to prevent them. The court found the defense of necessity inappropriate because trespasses intended to interfere with constitutional rights could not be justified by necessity, and in any event, the protestors' actions would merely draw attention to their views, not prevent abortions.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's decision, holding that &sect; 38.05.320(b) gave the city the right to convey tidelands adjacent to their boundaries, even if the boundaries were expanded subsequent to &sect; 38.05.320(b)'s enactment. The statute's language was unambiguous and indicated that expansion by cities that were incorporated before April 1, 1964, clearly created entitlements to the corresponding tidelands. Clarity of language placed a greater burden on the State to demonstrate that the legislative history revealed some hidden ambiguity. The court held that the statute's intent was clear.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the State of Alaska, its governor, and the Public Employees' Retirement System Board, sought review of a summary judgment from the Superior Court, Third Judicial District (Alaska), entered in favor of appellees, the Public Safety Employees' Association and its president, in appellees' action seeking a declaration that amendments to the statutory scheme underlying the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged amendments eliminated the distinction previously made between public safety employees and other participants in PERS. Appellees challenged the amendments enacted under Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 39.35.430(b), 39.35.410(d), 39.35.410(g). The court found that under the plain meaning of Alaska Const. art. XII, &sect; 7, the benefits under PERS were in the nature of deferred compensation and the right to such benefits vested immediately upon an employee's enrollment in PERS. The court concluded that its task on appeal was to determine whether the challenged amendments had disadvantageous effects on any of the state employees on whose behalf the instant suit was filed and, if so, to weigh the disadvantages against any advantages. The court found that the amendments unconstitutionally diminished the vested rights of the employees who were employed before the effective date of the amendments and who opted to receive benefits under the system in effect at the time they were hired. The court, however, concluded that the amendments were not unconstitutional as to the employees who elected to be covered by the amendments or the employees who were hired after the amendments became effective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment insofar as it applied to public safety employees who were hired before July 1, 1976, and who chose not to be covered by PERS in its amended form. The court reversed the judgment insofar as it applied to public safety employees hired before July 1, 1976, who elected to be covered by PERS as amended and to all public safety employees hired on or after July 1, 1976. The court remanded the action.</SPAN></P>

The representative argued that a direct action against an insurer should be allowed in suits among family members.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent and his wife disappeared on a flight from one city to another within the State. The wife owned and piloted the aircraft. Subsequently, the coroner's jury concluded that the decedent and his wife should be presumed dead. The representative filed a wrongful death action against the wife's estate. The representative then moved to amend the complaint to add the wife's liability insurer as a party to the action. The trial court denied the representative's motion. The representative appealed, arguing that a direct action against an alleged tortfeasor's insurer should be permitted to overcome the danger of prejudice that existed in a suit between family members. The court initially noted that only two jurisdictions allowed a direct cause of action against a tortfeasor's insurer; in such states, the actions were authorized expressly by statute. The court found that elsewhere, the common law rule of no direct liability prevailed. The court held that it was not persuaded to recognize a direct cause of action against an alleged tortfeasor's insurer because the common law on the subject was clear and overwhelmingly contrary to the representative's argument.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order denying the representative's motion to amend the complaint to add the insurer as a party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties entered a contract whereby the employee would perform as an exotic dancer for a set period of time, and the employer would compensate her at a set rate. The employer discharged the employee prior to the end of the contract after the employee had been accused of having engaged in an act of prostitution. The employer contended that the district attorney had requested that the employee's tenure be terminated. The trial court ruled in favor of the employee and awarded fees and costs. The superior court affirmed the judgment, but did away with the fees and costs award. The court determined that only the alcoholic beverage control could have revoked the employer's liquor license and that the employer wrongly terminated the employment of the employee. The court found that illegal acts committed by the employee were not grounds for termination of the employment contract because there had been no resultant damage to the employer's business. The court affirmed the prior judgment, but remanded the issue of fees and costs for additional findings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a daughter, who was adjudicated a mental incompetent, and her parents, who were her legal guardians, sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Fourth Judicial District that denied the parents' petition, which sought an order authorizing an tubal ligation for the daughter. The trial court denied the petition on the ground that it was without jurisdiction to issue the requested order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After discussing the issue with their daughter and her doctors, the parents filed a petition seeking an order authorizing a tubal ligation. The trial court found that the daughter understood the significance of the operation and that she desired to have it done. The trial court also found that the operation was in her best interest. However, the trial court denied the petition and held that it lacked jurisdiction. On appeal, the court reversed. In so doing, the court rejected the so-called majority rule, which held that absent a specific statutory grant of authority, courts were without jurisdiction to sanction the sterilization of a mental incompetent. The court held that the trial court, a court of general jurisdiction, as part of its inherent parens patriae authority, had the power to act upon the petition. Additionally, under Alaska Stat. &sect; 13.26.150(a)(3), the parents, as legal guardians, were specifically empowered to give the consent necessary to enable the daughter to receive medical care. Although the daughter's status prevented her expressed desires from being conclusive, that did not mean that her apparent preferences were ignored.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the trial court's judgment that denied the parent's petition for an order authorizing the sterilization of their daughter. The court directed that on remand the trial court was to question the daughter at length concerning the nature and consequences of the proposed operation, avoiding, to the greatest extent possible, the use of leading questions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the board's motion to dismiss the complaint as an untimely appeal from the board's February 5, 1979 decision. On appeal, the court vacated the dismissal and remanded the case. According the court, the statute of limitations set forth in Alaska R. App. P. 45 did not apply to the request for declaratory relief, which was an independent action, not an appeal. The court further found that, although the claims for damages and injunctive relief should have been filed as an appeal within 30 days of the date the board's letter was mailed to the applicant, the trial court, in the interests of justice, should have relaxed the requirements of Alaska R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state included lands that were originally granted to the state by the federal government for the support of the university in a state park. The state sought to enjoin a developer who had been given permission by the university to widen a road over the university land. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court agreed with the trial court that putting university lands into a state park without compensation was a breach of trust by the state. Subsequent repeal of the act under which the lands were granted did not indicate that Congress intended to allow the land to be used for other than university purposes. The inclusion of the land in the park violated the trust because restrictions on the use of park lands violated the trust's intent to maximize the return from the land for the university. The trial court erred in invalidating &sect; 41.20.210 because the state was free to dispose of the land without the approval of the university. The court also held that the award of nearly full attorney's fees was excessive because the state's claim was not frivolous, and remanded so that the university could be compensated for the full appraised value of the land.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it was not clear from the decision whether the trial court found, based on clear and convincing evidence, that the parental conduct was likely to have continued, and remanded for such a determination. The court also held that the new Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1901-1963 (the Act), provided a higher standard of protection to the rights of parents in termination proceedings involving Indians and Native Alaskans than that provided in Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.10.080(c)(3).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer claimed that the state had no jurisdiction to tax his net income and that to do so would violate the Due Process and Commerce clauses of the United States Constitution, and &sect; 381 of the Interstate Income Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 381 (1976). The taxpayer sought review when the superior court upheld the department's assessment and application of the state's apportionment formula. The court held that: (1) the taxpayer had sufficient minimum contacts with the state to be subject to the net income tax statutes; (2) that his activities in the state were not exempt from taxation under the Interstate Income Law; and (3) that the exact amount of his tax should be determined by the apportionment formula provided for in the state tax statutes. The court found that even though the taxpayer fished in international waters, the income was subject to state taxation because the sale had taken place when the crab were delivered to the processor. The court ruled that because the allocation formula was constitutional on its face and had not produced a grossly distorted result in the assessment of the taxpayer's tax liability, the department's apportionment formula was valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court consolidated for review an appeal by defendant witness from the Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage (Alaska), which held the witness in contempt of court for her refusal to testify and an appeal by the state where the superior court denied the state's motion to compel another witness to testify. Both witnesses had been granted immunity for their testimony against a defendant in a criminal proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two witnesses in a criminal proceeding refused to testify and invoked the Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination even though they had both been granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for their testimony. The issue presented by the proceeding was whether, in the absence of any authorizing statute on the subject, a promise of immunity by a state prosecutor and court could have been used to compel testimony from a witness in a criminal proceeding, despite the witness's claim of the privilege against self-incrimination. The court concluded that under proper circumstances, the testimony so immunized could be compelled. The danger that the privilege against self incrimination protected against had been removed by the prosecutor's grant of immunity. That immunity served to bind the state and federal government to whatever promise was made, to use and derivative use and/or transactional immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the contempt order of the superior court against the first witness and issued an order in the nature of mandamus to the superior court, to reconsider its denial of the application to compel testimony against the defendant in the underlying criminal proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a related federal action, the employees' were awarded back wages pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 201-219. The employer argued that the state Act was preempted by the FLSA. The court concluded that the Act was not preempted. In reaching its conclusion, the court found that the FLSA contained no express or implied declaration that state laws were preempted. Furthermore, given that wage laws were a traditional local concern and that the FSLA expressly allowed for state wage regulations, there was no evidence that Congress intended to &quot;occupy the field&quot; in enacting the FLSA. The court also found that there was no evidence that the employer would be unable to comply with both statutes. Nor would there be a risk of double recovery by bringing suits under both statutes as long as recovery under the Act was offset by recovery under the FLSA. The court found that procedural differences in the way the Act and the FLSA handled class action, preclusion, and liquidated damages did not indicate a conflict between the two laws because the purpose of the FLSA was not impeded by the procedural differences.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of the State of Alaska ordered forfeiture of the crab sale proceeds and the bond posted for the release of the vessel. The vessel's owners and the state filed cross appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vessel's owners alleged that the state could not regulate the vessel beyond the three-mile territorial waters limit, the regulations were unconstitutionally vague, they were denied due process of law, and trial court erred in admitting certain statistical evidence and in awarding the state attorney's fees. The state alleged that the vessel should have been forfeited. The court affirmed the trial court's forfeiture order, as no errors were made. The court concluded that the regulations were constitutional because the Emergency Orders left little question when the entire district was closed to king crab fishing. The court found that the state could regulate crab fisheries beyond the three-mile limit, that the vessel's owners were afforded procedural due process, and that the statistical evidence was properly admitted. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the attorney fees, and the &quot;public interest&quot; exception was inapplicable. The court found that the bond posted by the owners pursuant to the parties' stipulation to release the vessel for local fishing was substituted for the vessel and the amount of the bond could not be increased.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed and reversed the judgment. Section 20.15.070(b) provided, in addition to the absolute right of withdrawal within 10 days, that one might withdraw one's consent to adoption at any time before the entry of the adoption decree if a court found, after notice and an opportunity to be heard was afforded to all parties involved, that the withdrawal was in the best interest of the person to be adopted. No statement of reasons for the desired withdrawal was called for. The statute clearly called for a hearing on the best interest of the child if written notice of withdrawal was filed at any time prior to entry of the decree of adoption. Since such a notice was filed, the superior court's failure to afford the natural mother a hearing was error. Therefore, the court held that the natural mother was entitled to a hearing to determine whether withdrawal of her consent was in the best interest of the child.</SPAN></P>

He also argued that Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.15.210(c) (1978), as applied, was an unconstitutional ex post facto law because his first conviction came before the statute was enacted. The superior court affirmed the revocation. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 28.15.210(c) and Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.030 (1978) were separate statutes. The time provisions contained in &sect; 28.35.030 did not have to be engrafted onto the license revocation provisions. The court further held that Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.15.210(3) was not an unconstitutional ex post facto law because a sentence for a habitual offender was not either a new double jeopardy or additional penalty for earlier crimes, but a stiffened penalty for the latest crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two residents brought suit against the state, seeking a declaration that the permanent fund statute, which provided for cash distributions based on the number of years an individual was resident of the state was unconstitutional. The trial court invalidated the statute,&nbsp;Alaska Stat. &sect; 43.23.010-.100. The state appealed. The court reversed. The court held that all durational residency requirements did not automatically trigger strict scrutiny review. Instead, the nature and extent of the infringement on the right caused by the classification was balanced against the state's purpose in enacting the statute and the fairness of the relationship between the stated purpose and the classification. Here, strict scrutiny review was not necessary. The court concluded that the permanent fund distribution, durational residency statute did not violate the state or federal equal protection clauses.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the Board's decision. The court held that the practice of law by qualified persons was a fundamental right triggering scrutiny under the Privileges and Immunities Clause. The court found that the reason for the residency requirement, to afford the Alaska Bar Association with a reasonable opportunity to investigate an applicant's academic fitness and moral character, did further a legitimate state interest. However, the court stated that the discrimination that the rule worked against nonresidents did not bear a substantial relationship to the end sought by the Association. The court concluded that there were less restrictive means, other than residency for a designated period of time in Alaska, that would achieve the legitimate objectives.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the state argued that the taxpayers were not entirely excluded from personal taxes, that there was no evidence of purposeful discrimination against new residents created by the system of exemptions, and that any disproportionate impact the statutes may have had was incidental to the legislation's main objectives. The taxpayers cross-appealed, contending that declaring those sections of the income tax law invalid should have resulted in the repeal of the personal income tax. The court affirmed as to &sect; 43.20.017(a)-(c) and reserved judgment on &sect;&sect; 43.20.010-. 100, concluding, based on a rational basis test, that &sect; 43.20.017(a)-(c) violated recent residents' constitutional right to equal treatment, but that taxpayers were not exempt from personal income tax because &sect; 43.20.017(a)-(c) was severable from income tax statutes,&nbsp;Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 2, 3, 10, 11.</SPAN></P>

Recurrent problems associated with the injury resulted in the denial of a medical certificate, which the employee needed to work as a pilot. The employee filed a claim for disability benefits with the Board. The Board held that the scheduled maximum of Alaska Stat. &sect; 23.30.190(5), applicable when the employee's condition was first rated, controlled and that the rating had taken place by means of an offer by the employer's insurer to pay for the complete loss of one eye. The employer's insurer appealed to the superior court, which reversed and held the State liable for the portion of the award in excess of the maximum in effect at the date of the injury. The State appealed. On appeal, the court held that at the time the employee was injured the law provided that an injured worker was to be paid disability benefits at the rate in effect when he was rated rather than the rate in effect when he was injured. Because of Alaska Stat. &sect; 172, the employer's insurer had no reasonable expectation that the benefit rates in effect at the time of the injury would have remained constant. Section 172 obviously anticipated for them to change.</SPAN></P>

In response to a question from the jury the trial court stated that the term feloniously should be disregarded and that defendant did not have to intentionally violate the law, but he did have to intentionally do the act prohibited by law.

The jury convicted defendant of manslaughter. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial. The defense sought to introduce portions of the victim's journal that reflected a sense of mental instability, paranoia, hatred of women, and a violent nature. The trial court abused its discretion in excluding the journal. The character of the victim was vital to defendant's version of the events. The evidence was not unfairly prejudicial and was relevant to defendant's testimony as to what occurred prior to the shooting. A jury instruction disallowing any evidence of defendant's bad character brought to the jury's attention what evidence was inadmissible and emphasized the possibility of defendant's bad character, leaving the jury to speculate what evidence was kept from them.

The suspect was struck in the foot and thigh. The lower court interpreted Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12.25.080 as prohibiting the use of deadly force by a police officer to arrest a fleeing felon unless the officer had a reasonable belief that the fleeing felon was threatening the use of deadly force against either the officer himself, the victims of a crime, or innocent bystanders. The lower court alternatively held that, if not so interpreted, the statutory scheme violated the state's constitutional guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures. The court reversed, finding it was inappropriate to have invoked an exclusionary rule as a sanction against the officer's violation of &sect; 12.25.080, because the imposition of the rule would at best achieve only a marginal deterrent effect. Further, the exclusionary rule on the particular facts of the case was unwarranted. The officer had probable cause to arrest, was proceeding in accordance with existing departmental directives, and the degree of permissible force had not been previously construed by the court.</SPAN></P>

Appellants filed an action for injunctive and declaratory relief against appellees, a municipal corporation, a city clerk, and a city chief of police.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipality's ordinances required that all operators and employees of massage parlors and culture studios receive licenses. The ordinances prohibited the institutions from employing persons under the age of 18, persons addicted to drugs, or persons who had a felony, sexual, or violent crime convictions within the past two years. The ordinances also prohibited sexual activities and operation between 2 and 6 A.M. In appellants' action for declaratory and injunctive relief, the trial court upheld the constitutionality of the ordinances and awarded respondents attorneys' fees and costs. On appeal, the court modified and affirmed. The court held the provision regarding employment was not violative of due process rights and was a valid exercise of police power to prevent prostitution. The court also held the limitations of operation hours was not a violation of rights to equal protection. The court stated that the right to pursue an occupation and operate a massage parlor did not involve a fundamental right, and the regulation bore a fair and substantial relation to legitimate objectives. The court further held the regulation did not infringe on appellants' rights to privacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, which revoked appellant's probation, which sentenced him to the maximum terms on each of the original offenses, and which refused to give credit for time spent in a residential treatment house as a condition of probation. Additionally, appellant challenged his sentence as being excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that he was given a sentence in excess of the maximum allowed by statute because of the refusal to give credit for time spent in a residential treatment house as a condition of probation and was thus subjected to multiple punishment in violation of his right against double jeopardy. The double jeopardy clauses, U.S. Const. amend. V and Alaska Const., art. I, &sect; 9, protected against multiple punishment for the same crime. The court agreed with appellant that he had a statutory right to credit for time served on probation under the restrictions of a rehabilitation program. Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.05.040(a) provided that, when a person was sentenced to imprisonment, his term of confinement began from the day of his sentence. In enacting Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.05.040, the court believed that the legislature intended that credit be given, upon sentencing, for time spent in special facilities and treatment programs. Regarding appellant's claim that his sentence was excessive, the court held that appellant was characterized as the worst type of offender and had been sentenced accordingly. The use of consecutive sentences was appropriate because of appellant's past escape conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's sentence but ordered that the days spent in the residential treatment house during probation be credited against his sentence.</SPAN></P>

The municipal attorney concluded that the amendment was contrary to law and, if enacted, it would be a nullity. Accordingly, the municipality filed a complaint for declaratory judgment seeking to have the proposed initiative declared unlawful and removed from the ballot. The trial court found that the initiative was contrary to Alaska Stat. &sect; 29.53.055 and ordered the proposition removed from the ballot. The court affirmed, finding that the proposed amendment would conflict with Alaska Stat. &sect; 29.53.170, as that statute required that taxes be levied by general ordinance and, under the proposed amendment, the assembly could not increase taxes without a ratification by referendum to the voters. Further, it was not error for the trial court to review the initiative prior to its submission to the voters as it was useless to allow voters to cast their ballots on the proposed initiative when it was in clear conflict with a state statute.</SPAN></P>

Appellant Attorney General filed a complaint under the Alaska Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Act, Alaska Stat. &sect; 45.50.501, alleging that appellee had employed deception in collecting debts.

Appellant also claimed that appellee's practices violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1681g, because of appellee's refusal to disclose files upon proper demand. A subsequent bench trial ensued, and the lower court granted appellee's motion to dismiss on the grounds that &sect; 45.50.471 was unconstitutionally vague in allowing liability for debt collectors.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Fourth Judicial District, Bethel denied the State's motion, which sought an order revoking defendant's release. The grounds for the denial were that Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.30.040(b) as applied was an unconstitutional infringement of the right to bail and that under Alaska R. Crim. P. 32(a), the trial court was vested with discretion to continue respondent on release status. The State sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon, assault with intent to commit rape, and rape. Defendant's request for continuation of his release status until sentencing was granted. The State filed a motion seeking an order revoking defendant's release status on grounds that the provisions of Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.30.040(b) did not permit release on bail before sentencing. The trial court denied the State's motion. Although the case was moot after defendant was sentenced, the court granted review because the petition involved important recurring issues that were capable of evading review. The court limited its review to whether Alaska Const. art. 1, &sect; 11, the bail clause, applied after the conviction because the alternative basis of the trial court's decision was not adequately briefed. The court held that the bail clause did not afford a right of post-conviction bail. In making its determination, the court considered similar provisions in other states' constitutions and concluded that the uniform interpretation they had received, at the time that Alaska's Constitution was drafted and approved, was that they applied only to bail before a conviction.</SPAN></P>

The daughter then told her mother that the man that the two had seen purchasing the oven was among the photographs that the police had shown her.

The court found that under the federal rational basis standard, the classification of prior gear licensees as the class eligible to apply for entry permits was reasonable because it possessed some rational connection to the overall goals of the Act and preventing unjust discrimination in the allocation of the permits. The court found, under Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 1, that the purposes of the Act were legitimate and within the police power of the state and that limiting the eligible pool of applicants to gear license holders bore a fair and substantial relationship to the purpose of preventing unjust discrimination in the awarding of entry permits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, which reversed the commission's denial of an entry permit to the commercial fisherman, and ruled that the requirement in the Limited Entry Act that only persons who had previously held a gear license could apply for an entry permit did not violate equal protection. The court remanded the matter for determination of whether the commercial fisherman had in fact held a gear license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A worker sustained injuries when he was on the job and a scaffolding platform gave way. He was performing services at the site for his employer, an electrical subcontractor who was employed by the general contractor, who was employed by the project owner. The injured worker sought compensation from all involved, and his wife sought loss of consortium. The trial court handed down orders refusing to allow affirmative defenses that abrogated the rule of joint and several liability. From these orders, the general contractor, the supervisor, and the project owner sought interlocutory review. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, finding that the judicial adoption of comparative negligence did not disturb the continuing validity of joint and several liability. The court also determined that the procedural due process and equal protection claims were without merit. Finally, the court held that the legislature was responsible for answering the question of whether a third party in an action by the employee could receive contribution or indemnity from the employer, when the employer's negligence had caused or contributed to the injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant purchased dynamite from the thieves, and helped them set fuses on the dynamite to go back and destroy the evidence of the burglary. Following the trial, defendant's motion for acquittal was denied. Pursuant to the jury verdict, the superior court convicted defendant and denied his motion for a new trial based upon his pre-sentencing psychiatric examination. Defendant sought post-conviction relief under Alaska R. Crim. P. 35(b)(4), which the superior court denied. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed in part and vacated in part. The court found that the superior court had correctly placed the burden of proof on defendant in the post-conviction proceeding. The expert testimony was in conflict on defendant's diminished capacity claim, and the superior court had not abused its discretion in finding defendant had not carried the burden of proof. The burglary conviction was supported because defendant provided the means and expertise to destroy the property. However, the conviction for malicious destruction of property was in error because the burglary and the property destruction charges constituted essentially one course of conduct designed to destroy evidence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the statutes were vague, overbroad, and violated equal protection. Defendant also challenged his probation revocation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A juvenile agreed to meet defendant while fitted with a microphone and transmitter at the request of the police.

Defendant was convicted under contributing to the delinquency of a minor statutes, Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 11.40.130 and .150. Defendant's probation was later revoked. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and the probation revocation. Section 11.40.150(12), which defined a child as &quot;delinquent&quot; if he engaged in &quot;immoral conduct,&quot; was not overbroad because it only penalized speech directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action, namely defendant's attempts to persuade the juvenile to have fellatio. Defendant's equal protection rights were not violated where he was charged with a felony provision because the elements necessary to prove the felony and the misdemeanor were different. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in revoking defendant's probation where his commission of a crime on probation, particularly an offense very similar to his original one, supported the conclusion that his probationary status was at odds with the need to protect society.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and sentence and determined that: (1) there was no improper charging discretion because assault with intent to commit rape required elements of the crime that were not present in a charge of attempted rape; (2) while there was some suggestive influence from the improper procedure of using a single photograph for identification, the totality of the circumstances indicated that the reliability of the witness in making the identification overcame the suggestiveness so that the original identification and in-court identification were properly admitted; and (3) the search warrant was validly issued because it was based on evidence that the car to be searched probably contained evidence of the crime.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court's denial of two motions for a bill of particulars. The information requested in the first motion was a request for discovery of the state's case in toto and went beyond the proper scope of a bill of particulars. The second motion was properly denied because adequate knowledge of the charge was provided to defendant by the grand jury testimony. The police could validly seize defendant's van under the reasonable assumption that it had been abandoned when it was pushed off an embankment. They could impound the van, which was suspected of having been involved in an accident, to prevent the destruction of evidence. The van was lawfully in police custody and they were entitled to inspect the exterior. The evidence found during that inspection was admissible at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the issue was whether the trial court was correct in concluding that, as a matter of law, an award of fees under the provisions of the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988, must have been limited to partial rather than full compensation. The court concluded that the diminution of the award was predicated on the court's election to follow the tenets of the Alaska Supreme Court, which suggested the award of partial rather than full attorney's fees. The court held that this was the correct approach to be applied in determining an award of attorney's fees under Alaska R. Civ. P. 82(a). The court held that it was not, however, applicable to fee awards under the federal act. The court reversed the judgment and remanded for a new fee determination, holding that the trial court erred in assuming that state rather than federal guidelines applied in ascertaining an appropriate fee award under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. The court held that the federal act envisioned no subtraction from a fee award merely because the litigation was terminated in whole or in part by consent decree or stipulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One month after moving to the city the candidate attempted to file a declaration of candidacy for the office of city councilman, but it was refused based on his failure to satisfy the one-year residency requirement of Homer City Code &sect; 3-200.2. Relying chiefly on decisions from the California courts, the candidate maintained that there was no compelling state interest in a one-year residency requirement. In upholding the residency requirement, the court re-affirmed its holding that the state had a compelling interest in legislators who were acquainted with the conditions, problems, and needs of those who are governed and in electors who were familiar with the character, habits, and reputation of candidates for political office. After reviewing decisions from a number of jurisdictions, the court concluded that the standard employed in California was not applicable to conditions in Alaska where there were many sparsely populated communities and where word of mouth and personal contact were the most effective means of communication about local concerns.</SPAN></P>

Defendants' were charged with prostitution, but their motions to dismiss were denied by both the district and superior courts. On appeal, the court found that, Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.40.210, which defined prostitution, discriminated against females. A male could commit the offense of prostitution, but was nowhere made criminal by the statute. In striking at prostitution the legislation singled out only the female body as the critical physical element of the crime. In view of the gender neutrality required by the Alaska Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Upon his refusal to submit to a chemical test of his breath, he was taken to a hospital where a sample of blood was taken without his consent. Testing of the blood sample revealed the presence of alcohol. The district court denied defendant's motion to suppress the results of the blood alcohol test, and it also denied his demand to be tried by a jury of 12 persons. Defendant pled nolo contendere to the offense, reserving his right to appeal. The superior court affirmed the rulings of the district court, and on further appeal, the court held that defendant's motion to suppress the blood alcohol evidence should have been granted. However, the court held that defendant's demand for a jury trial was properly denied because, under Alaska Stat. &sect; 22.15.150, he was only entitled in district court to a jury of six. Furthermore, the court held that &sect; 22.115.150 was not in conflict with Alaska Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee aggrieved parties filed an action challenging the constitutionality of an initiative that was enacted by the voters as the Alaska Homestead Act. The initiative made available 30 million acres of state land, valued at $ 9 billion, to be given away in specified amounts to any Alaska resident of three or more years. Further, it imposed no obligations on the resident after the land was received. The trial court held that the initiative was an appropriation and therefore unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The initiative was an appropriation, even though it gave away land rather than money, because in Alaska, land was a primary asset of the state treasury, and the initiative permitted the depletion of Alaska's treasury.

As to these needs, the trial court's findings were that the ex-husband was principally involved in the child's religious education and that he and his new wife participated in an &quot;organized religious community.&quot; The court remanded the action for a new custody determination without regard to religious affiliation. Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.55.205 was not facially invalid because the Constitution did not foreclose courts from attempting to accommodate a child's religious beliefs or religious needs. However, &sect; 09.55.205 was applied in a manner that violated the Establishment Clause. No finding was made that the child had religious needs. Therefore, reliance on the religious findings was impermissible under the Establishment Clause because it put the government on the side of organized religion. Because the court found a violation under the Establishment Clause, it declined to address violations of the other provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The airline complained to the Alaska Transportation Commission that the air taxi service was violating the Alaska Air Commerce Act, Alaska Stat. &sect; 02.05. The airline alleged that the air taxi service was carrying passengers on an individual fare basis between points served on a &quot;regular&quot; basis and charging individual fares less than those charged by the airline, which was the scheduled air carrier. The Commission ruled in favor of the airline. The trial court held that the evidence was insufficient to support the Commission's finding that the air taxi service had provided &quot;regular&quot; service. The trial court found that there had been a tariff violation, but that the penalization was fundamentally unfair. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that although the air taxi service made numerous trips between the two destinations, no hourly, daily, or weekly pattern of &quot;regular&quot; service was established. The court gave consideration to the integral part that air taxi services played in rural Alaskan life. The court noted that although the air taxi service had violated Alaska Stat. &sect; 02.05.050(d)(3), its tariff had been properly filed and accepted by the Commission.</SPAN></P>

The ASOS was the disbanded and the school districts were created to govern education in the unorganized borough. The union alleged that the school districts had breached the agreement relating to their noncertificated employees. The court held that the school districts had no statutory duty to bargain with the noncertificated employees because the PERA exempted such employees from its coverage. Thus, the school districts were not bound to the preexisting collective bargaining agreement and had no duty to bargain with a bargaining representative of the noncertificated employees. Because the PERA did not encompass the employees, the court reversed the order referring the case to a labor relations agency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants were the kin of a worker who died as a result of a workplace injury. They commenced an action before the board to obtain death benefits from the carrier. The board awarded benefits and later increased the compensation payable to the claimants in a subsequent proceeding. The trial court affirmed that benefits increase and the award of attorney's fees entered in favor of the claimants. On appeal, the court affirmed the board's increase in death benefits payable, but remanded the matter for a recalculation of attorney's fees in accordance with the formula set forth in Alaska Stat. &sect; 23.30.145(a). The court held that all death benefit claims that arose after May 22, 1975 were governed by the increasing rates in the maximum table in Alaska Stat. &sect; 23.30.175(a). Further, the court found that the new table set forth in &sect; 23.30.175(a) did not operate to retroactively impair the carrier's contract obligations in violation of Alaska and federal constitutions. In the court's reasoning, the statute had no retroactive effect because it did not grant increases to claimants injured before the new maximum rates were passed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court judgment that upheld the board's increase in death benefits payable to the claimants was affirmed.

The appellate court affirmed their convictions and the court affirmed.

The court determined that the ordinance was not flawed with overbreadth, which could have produced a chilling effect on First Amendment rights. The court concluded that the ordinance gave defendants adequate notice that their conduct was prohibited and defendants' conduct fell squarely within the &quot;hard core&quot; of the statute's proscriptions. The court found that the ordinance did not have the potential for arbitrary or selective enforcement and was therefore not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendants' conduct. The court held that as the ordinance had been amended there was no vagueness problem with the ordinance's definition of lewdness. The court found that defendants' privacy rights had not been infringed because their rights did not encompass commercial sex in a public establishment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant locked his vehicle and threw the keys away. The officer administered a filed sobriety test and placed defendant under arrest for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants. Another officer was called to the scene to inventory defendant's vehicle and tow the vehicle to storage. The officer that inventoried the vehicle lifted the lid of a briefcase and found what appeared to be marijuana and cocaine. The vehicle was then taken to the police garage. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence from the briefcase, which was granted by the superior court. On appeal, the court affirmed on the basis that a warrantless inventory search of closed, locked or sealed luggage, containers, or packages contained within a vehicle was unreasonable and thus an unconstitutional search under the Alaska Const. art.

The airline employee, who had become suspicious of the packages based upon defendant's &quot;nervous&quot; behavior and an odor coming from the packages, cut open the box with a pocket knife, finding a large plastic bag sealed with electrical tape. He unraveled the tape of that bag and another similar bag inside it, exposing square-shaped objects containing a &quot;hay-like&quot; substance, which he concluded were &quot;bricks&quot; of marijuana. Although defendant had no prior criminal record other than traffic offenses, the trial court sentenced defendant to serve five years in prison. The court held that: (1) the search by the airline employee, acting for an independent and legitimate airline purpose and not in conjunction with or at the direction of the police, did not violate constitutional prohibitions against unreasonable search and seizure; and (2) because the offense was one which society did not strongly condemn, that factor should not have been considered as a reason for imposing the severe sentence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant purchased goods from two stores, paying with checks drawn on his bank account. There were insufficient funds in his account to cover the checks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prosecution witnesses before the grand jury included store sales people and a police investigator who testified that defendant had admitted that he had written the checks knowing his account did not have sufficient funds. The State also introduced defendant's bank statement. On appeal, defendant challenged the legality of the State's use of his bank records. The court found that even if the bank records were excluded, there still was sufficient evidence to support the indictment. It also rejected defendant's constitutional challenge to the statutory scheme under which he was convicted. Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.20.210 made it a misdemeanor for a person to issue a check knowing he had insufficient funds. Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.20.230 provided that a person who, with intent to defraud, passed a check knowing he had insufficient funds was guilty of larceny. Because &sect; 11.20.230 required proof of the intent to defraud, these statutes attached different penalties to different offenses and the statutory scheme was not void for vagueness. However, the court remanded for resentencing because the trial court failed to afford defendant the opportunity to make a statement on his own behalf at sentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction, but remanded the case for a new sentencing hearing consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee's Seventh-Day Adventist religious beliefs forbade his joining or contributing to a union. His employer, however, was a union shop. Pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement, the union demanded that the employer fire the employee. The employee proposed to pay the amount of union dues to a charity and forego union benefits but the union rejected that proposal. The union offered to apply the employee's dues to a contingency fund used for picnics and the like and not for collective bargaining but the employee rejected that proposal. The employee sued the union and the employer for declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief, and the state commission on human rights joined as a plaintiff. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the union and the employer. The court affirmed. The court held that the employer and the union could not do more than they offered to do to reasonably accommodate the employee without undue hardship. That offer satisfied the requirements of Alaska Stat. &sect; 18.80.220.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants brought a consolidated appeal in connection with judgments of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, in which defendants were convicted of violating Anchorage Municipal Ordinance 8.14.110. The ordinance prohibited loitering for the purpose of solicitation of prostitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants contended that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. The court agreed with the argument. The court held that a vague statute violated the due process clause when its indefinite contours conferred unbridled discretion on government officials and thereby raised the possibility of uneven and discriminatory enforcement. The court ruled that a literal reading of the ordinance disclosed such an infirmity. It set out separate and disjunctive circumstances that could be considered in determining whether a person who was loitering manifested the purpose of soliciting for prostitution. One such circumstance was that the person was a known prostitute or panderer. Thus anyone known to police to have committed a prostitution-related offense within the past five years was subject to arrest under the ordinance if he or she was found &quot;loitering.&quot; The municipality argued that the ordinance did not encourage arbitrary arrests and convictions because of the narrowing effect of the reference in the ordinance to known prostitutes and panderers. However, not even past violation of the criminal law authorized one's subjection to innately vague statutory specifications of crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' convictions under the ordinance were reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on intent and on abandonment of the copper, in refusing to give a requested instruction on his subjective belief that the copper was abandoned, and in failing to find that the copper was abandoned as a matter of law, that the evidence was insufficient to prove specific intent, and that any larceny was completed before he transported the copper. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case. The court was unable to conclude that the trial court's use of a Mann instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and it found that the trial court's abandonment instruction erroneously placed upon defendant the burden of proving that the copper had been abandoned. The court did not find that the trial court abused its discretion in rejecting defendant's requested instruction.

The statutory age limit was 16 years old. The parties stipulated that defendant had a reasonable belief that the victim was 16 years old. In light of that stipulation, the trial court ordered that it would instruct the jury that mistake of age was a defense to statutory rape. The State filed a petition for review from that order. The State argued that mistake of age was not a defense to statutory rape in most jurisdictions. On review, the court affirmed the order of the trial court. The court found that consciousness of wrongdoing was an essential element of penal liability. The court held that a charge of statutory rape was defensible where an honest and reasonable mistake of fact as to the victim's age was shown. The court opined that statutory rape was not a &quot;public welfare&quot; offense where general requirement of criminal intent was waived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.060 was unconstitutional on its face, because it criminalized acts or omissions committed without any intent. The court explained that it was required to interpret statutes so as to uphold their constitutionality. An inadvertent or unwitting failure to render assistance could not result in a felony conviction. But the legislature had not intended that result. The legislature intended the courts to read into the statute a knowledge requirement by implication. To the extent that the court's prior cases had restricted interpretation by implication to common law crimes, those cases were overruled. The State was required to prove that the driver actually knew of the injury or that the accident was of such a nature that the driver reasonably anticipated that it injured someone. The superior court erred in instructing that mere knowledge of the accident was sufficient. Intoxication, not a defense to a general intent crime, was a defense on the issue of whether defendant had the requisite knowledge to violate the statute. Reversal was also required because the superior court allowed a sealed verdict over defense objection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 02.330(a) was void for vagueness because it failed to give adequate or fair notice of the conduct that was prohibited. The court stated that the words used in &sect; 02.330(a) by themselves, and also in conjunction with each other, had commonly understood meanings. One did not have to guess as to whether he engaged in a race with someone else while driving his car. He either had the requisite intent to race, or he did not. If his purpose and the manner he drove as to the other driver were to engage in competition in respect to speed or distance to prove superiority, then he would have no difficulty in knowing from the terms of &sect; 02.330(a) that he could be found guilty of violating it. He was given fair warning of the kind of act proscribed. Thus, &sect; 02.330(a) was not void for vagueness. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, there was a fair inference from the evidence that defendant and the other driver engaged in a speed competition, i.e., were racing contrary to &sect; 02.330(a). Thus, the court held that there was sufficient evidence to support a conclusion by a reasonable person that there was no reasonable doubt as to defendant's guilt.</SPAN></P>

Careless use of firearms under Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.15.200 was a lesser included offense of the crime charged, however, it was harmless error for the trial court not to have given a jury instruction thereon because the jury found defendant guilty of shooting with intent to kill or wound when it had the lesser included offense of assault with a dangerous weapon. There was no fatal variance between the indictment and the charge. The trial court was not clearly mistaken when it imposed the sentence. There were other sentences imposed for the same crime that were greater and other that were lesser.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for the crime of lewd and lascivious acts towards a child. A jury returned a verdict of guilty and the court affirmed the conviction. It found that it was not error to impose a one year residency requirement for grand jurors, as it guaranteed a nexus between a juror and the community and there was no common thread running through the excluded group, except a lack of familiarity with the community. Further, the use of rules of the supreme court to provide the prosecution with peremptory challenges was constitutional, as the court construed Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.20.090 as a legislative declaration of the right to peremptory challenges and authorization for the supreme court to deal with the procedural aspects of the right through its rule-making powers. Finally, it was not error to deny defense counsel's request for a competency hearing made just prior to opening statements, as defendant had previously been found competent to stand trial and counsel's showing of disagreements over whether to accept a plea bargain and whether to have a jury trial, without reference to bizarre behavior by defendant, was insufficient to trigger the holding of a competency hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State contended that defendant struck an individual in the forehead with metal knuckles when the two became involved in an argument at a pipeline construction camp, while defendant maintained that he had never owned a pair of knuckles and had not in fact used any knuckles during the altercation. Defendant was charged pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.15.220, which made it a felony for a person armed with a dangerous weapon to assault another with the weapon. The court held that the offense of simple assault or assault and battery, as provided in Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.15.230, was a lesser included offense with respect to assault with a dangerous weapon. Further, the court concluded that under the ordinary rule, defendant's request for an instruction on assault and battery as well as on assault with a dangerous weapon should not have been denied because there was sharply conflicting evidence at trial as to whether defendant had used a dangerous weapon in the commission of the alleged assault. Reversing, the court overlooked the fact that defendant's request for the instruction was technically untimely due to the importance of the omitted instruction under the circumstances presented.</SPAN></P>

The State intervened.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A paving corporation sued to foreclose a lien on the owners' property, alleging that it had performed labor and supplied materials for the benefit of the property, and that the lien on which enforcement was sought had been filed. The property owners denied any personal obligation to the corporation and filed affirmative defenses attacking the constitutionality of Alaska Stat. &sect; 34.35.070(d)-(f). The State was allowed to intervene in order to defend the constitutionality of the act. On appeal, the court found that the trial court abused its discretion in finding no just reason for delay and in directing the entry of final judgment. There was a substantial relationship between the property owners' claim that the statute was so incomprehensible as to be unconstitutional and the actual application of the statute to the corporation's claim. The fact that there would have been no appeal by the parties before the court on the constitutional questions presented if the ordinary manner of proceeding was followed was a persuasive reason for deferring review until the entire case was decided. The court saw no benefits to be gained by deviating from the normal finality rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A witness said that defendant pointed a gun at her head and later fired a shot through a wall as he left a trailer. The shot struck the victim in the head. Affirming, the court said that Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.15.220, the assault with a dangerous weapon statute, was constitutional. The court held that any resulting deprivation arising from a failure to preserve and produce the position and direction of fingerprints on a lamp did not rise to the level of a due process violation. The State's failure to do so did not violate Alaska R. Crim. P. 16(b)(7). Defendant neither requested the evidence nor indicated its importance. Defendant claimed that his right to confrontation and cross-examination was violated by the superior court's failure to allow the introduction of hospital records reflecting the witness's statements after a suicide attempt. If the hospital records fell within an exception to the hearsay rule, their exclusion was error only if they were otherwise admissible on a sufficient offer of proof. Defendant's offer of proof was inadequate. The court held that the exclusion was proper. Assuming that the exclusion was error, it was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of five counts of selling heroin and one count of possessing heroin. The trial court sentenced him to serve a term of 10 years, the maximum, on each count.

The trial court further determined that he was to be ineligible for parole until he had served five years. On appeal, he contended that his sentence was excessive, arguing that the trial court relied heavily on two prior convictions that were subsequently reversed and that he should not have been classified as &quot;the worst type of drug offender.&quot; The court found that defendant was engaged in the heroin business for profit, not as an addict in need of a source for his habit, and the unauthorized sale for profit of harmful substances to the citizens of Alaska was conduct that merited a great deal of concern. Therefore, considering the aggravating circumstances surrounding his substantial traffic in heroin, the trial court did not erred in classifying him as the worst type of drug offender or in imposing the sentence it did.</SPAN></P>

Even had the statutes been sufficiently precise to have escaped the defect of vagueness, they were still overbroad because truth was not an absolute defense under the statute but a conditional one.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Director denied certification on January 26, 1966, because adequate information to establish that the well was located on a separate geologic structure was not presented within the 90 day period prescribed by Alaska Admin.

On remand, the Commissioner denied certification because insufficient information was submitted within the 90 days and evidence submitted thereafter could not be considered. Reversing, the court held that the 90-day limitation set forth in the regulation was unenforceable against the lessees because it was inconsistent with statutory policy allowing for discovery royalties. The court ruled that the substantive right to a discovery royalty carried with it a reasonable opportunity to qualify for the royalty and that whether 90 days was a reasonable time had to be determined on remand.

The mother moved to dismiss the petition because it was unverified and failed to state a cause of action and the guardian ad litem argued that Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.10.010(a)(5) was unconstitutional. The trial court found the statute to be constitutional, denied the motions to dismiss of the mother and the guardian ad litem, and adjudged the children to be dependent. The court found that the temporary custody order included a finding that the petition was verified and was sufficient on its face; however, it remanded the matter for review under the standards of the new law, as the children's law had undergone major revision since the fling of the appeals and most of the guardian ad litem's objections to the old law were rendered moot by enactment of the new law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution appealed the trial court's dismissal of defendants' indictments for possession, sale and distribution of narcotic drugs as defined in Alaska Stat. &sect; 17.10.230. Defendants challenged the validity of the state's laws prohibiting cocaine, and the trial court found that the classification of cocaine as a narcotic violated equal protection and due process guarantees of the Alaska Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the court noted that cocaine was probably less harmful than popularly believed, it reversed the trial court and concluded that Alaska Stat. &sect; 17.10 was valid. The court rejected the argument that cocaine, because it was not pharmacologically a &quot;narcotic,&quot; should be classified under Alaska Stat. &sect; 17.12 with amphetamines, which produce similar physiological effects to cocaine. The legislature had the discretion to define cocaine as a narcotic for the purposes of the law and that, in common usage, &quot;narcotics&quot; included cocaine. The court also found sufficient evidence of cocaine's potential for harm to justify its inclusion with opiates, and therefore held that the classification was permissible and the legislative goal was not so irrational or arbitrary as to violate due process. The court rejected the argument that cocaine was as harmless a drug as marijuana, and held that, unlike marijuana, there was no privacy right protecting the use of cocaine in the home. The court held that prosecutors did not have discretion to charge cocaine offenses under &sect; 17.12, because cocaine did not fall within that statute's definition of &quot;depressant, hallucinogenic and stimulant drugs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate actions, two teachers' unions sued school boards to compel collective bargaining in good faith under Alaska Stat. &sect; 14.20.550. In a third case, a school board sought declaratory judgment that certain issues were not bargainable. The school boards contended that items affecting educational policy including class size and the use of teacher specialists and para-professionals were not bargainable. The decisions were split in the trial courts. In a consolidated appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that salaries, fringe benefits, the number of hours worked, and the amount of leave time were negotiable but other matters that affected educational policy were not. The court also held that a trial court erred when, in construing the statutes, it relied upon the privately expressed opinion, by means of a letter, of a former legislator. Because the legislator's opinion was not a matter of public record, subject to judicial notice, nor was it introduced in evidence, even if it were placed in evidence, reliance upon it as a means of legal interpretation was not permissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, convicted on drug charges, was paroled . Among the parole officer's conditions of release, signed by defendant, was a requirement that defendant submit his person, premises, and vehicle to search by a parole or peace officer on demand. Defendant was taken by his parole officer to the airport on his way to a new job. The officer received a tip that defendant had used heroin recently. Defendant could not give a urine sample at the airport. The parole officer searched defendant and discovered heroin. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence from the search and convicted him of drug possession. On appeal, the court compared parolees' rights to be free of unreasonable searches under the state and federal constitutions to the rights of other persons. Parolees had a diminished expectation of privacy by virtue of their status; they had not &quot;consented&quot; to the terms of release. The legitimacy of a search depended on the nature of their past crime and had to be reasonably related to the parolee's rehabilitation and public protection. The court urged the parole board to adopt rules that would not leave parole conditions to individual officers' discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision to convict defendant of heroin possession and to sentence him to 10 years' incarceration, with a recommendation that he receive drug therapy.</SPAN></P>

Both parties sought summary judgment. The trial court found for the commission. The physician appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal the issues were whether the physician was exempt from compliance with the Alaska Conflict of Interest law (COI law), Alaska Stat. &sect; 39.50.010 et seq., or was barred by the ethical considerations attendant on the physician-patient relationship and whether disclosure of the names of individual patients unconstitutionally invaded each patient's right to privacy. The court held that: (1) the physician was not exempt from compliance with the statute because Alaska Stat. &sect; 39.50.200(8) encompassed individual patients as sources of income; (2) there was no legal privilege which precluded compliance with the COI law because a patient's name was not protected under Alaska R. Civ. P. 43(h)(4); (3) the physician had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the COI law on behalf of his patients because the patients, in attempting to vindicate their rights, would forfeit the very privacy they sought to protect; and (4) in the absence of applicable regulations designed to protect certain classes of patients, the COI law impermissibly infringed on a constitutionally-protected zone of privacy by making public certain confidential or sensitive information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Legislature had passed 1976 Alaska Sess.

The trial court enjoined the Lieutenant Governor to put the proposition on a general election ballot with the amount provided for in the Legislative enactment. Subsequent to the Lieutenant Governor's appeal of the trial court's judgment for the taxpayer, ch. 124 was approved by the electorate in its original form.

The court held that defendant's argument that the assault statute, Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.15.220, was unconstitutional was without merit because there was no constitutional impediment to the legislature allowing the trial court to impose lesser punishments for felonies than a prison term exceeding one year. Defendant knew from the indictment and from the trial court's instructions that the charge against him was based on his shooting a pistol when driving by the gas station. Thus, defendant was not denied his right under the Sixth Amendment or Alaska R. Crim. P. 7(c) to notice of the nature and cause of the accusations against him. Defendant could not raise his objections to the jury instructions on the question of assault with a dangerous weapon for the first time on appeal, and if there were any error in the instructions, it did not rise to the level of plain error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband was stopped outside of his home in connection with an investigation by the police officers of a reported rape and murder. In deducting the trespass award from the overall award of damages, the court held that the police officers had been entitled to assert as a defense that they were privileged to enter appellees' home without permission and without a warrant because they had a reasonable belief that a body was in their residence, which created an emergency situation. The court also overturned the damage award on the false imprisonment claim, noting that false arrest and false imprisonment were not separate torts with separate rights of recovery. Although the court did uphold the judgment for appellees on the false arrest claim, it remanded the case. The court noted that the fact that the husband had been placed in the back of police vehicle, from which he could not voluntarily leave, provided sufficient evidence that he was put under &quot;actual restraint&quot; within the meaning of Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.25.050 and that he was in fact arrested.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to an ordinance, the city granted the applicant permission to construct a building. Thereafter, the homeowners brought an action against the city and the applicant. After invalidating the ordinance, the trial court awarded the homeowners full attorney's fees pursuant to rule 82, concluding that the city was the proper party to be charged. Accordingly, the city sought review. Upon review, the court held that the policy of encouraging public interest litigants supported an award of attorney's fees to prevailing plaintiffs in all public interest cases. The court also rejected the contention that the city had no capacity to be charged with the award. Moreover, the court held that a borough had not been an indispensable party because the trial court had been able to dispose of the case without the borough's presence and because there was no possibility of further litigation. Furthermore, the court held that it would have been unfair to assess fees against the applicant because the applicant had relied upon the invalid ordinance. Finally, the court held that the trial court did not err in awarding full attorney's fees because the homeowners were public interest plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

Code tit. 5, &sect; 81.070(b). Defendant appealed, arguing that the state Board of Fish and Game did not have the authority to revoke his license for the offenses. The court ruled that a guide license was subject to revocation under Alaska Stat. &sect; 08.54.200(b) if after a hearing the Board of Fish and Game found that the licensee (1) engaged in unethical activity, unsafe activity, or activity which adversely affected the natural resources of the state when such activity was unrelated to the legal purposes of the contract hunt, or (2) violated a provision of a federal or state sport fish, game, or guide statute or regulation. The court remanded the judgment, concluding that a determination was necessary as to whether the decision to revoke defendant's license would have been the same had there been no finding that his activities constituted unsafe activity.</SPAN></P>

There was an adequate evidentiary basis for the trial court's conclusion that defendant possessed the mental capacity to make a knowing and intelligent waiver of his Miranda rights. Admittedly, the evidence was conflicting on this issue; nevertheless, in the evidentiary context of the case, the court could not have said, as a matter of law, that the trial court erred in its determination that defendant effectively waived his Miranda rights. The evidence showed that there was evidentiary basis sufficient to conclude that defendant's mental faculties were not significantly impaired during the relevant times in question.

The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court determined that a warrant was obtained for defendant's arrest, as required under Alaska Stat. &sect; 33.15.200. The parole board had probable cause to believe that defendant had violated the conditions of his parole. The court held that the arrest warrant was not invalid simply because it was not supported by a sworn complaint or affidavit. While defendant had more rights than one who was still incarcerated, he was not entitled to the same procedural protections as a person not under court supervision.

In that regard, the overbreadth doctrine was inapplicable because the statute did not restrict constitutionally protection conduct. While &sect; 11.15.260 did not specify the amount of movement necessary to transform the crime of assault or rape into kidnapping, the court found that the statute did not give undue discretion to law enforcement personnel.

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's denial of relief, except with respect to &sect; 38.40.090(1)(A). The court held that imposing a one-year durational residency requirement was invalid in violating the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The court applied the strict scrutiny level of review and found that the correlation between the classification made by &sect; 38.40.090(1)(A) and the state's goal of reduced unemployment and a stabilized economy were not sufficiently strong so that the classification was the least drastic means to achieve those ends.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to one year in prison. Defendant challenged his designation as an officer, the trial court's instruction of that status under Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.30.250, and whether &sect; 11.30.250 was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for the felony of stealing public records under Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.30.250. He contended that he was an employee and thus could have only been charged for violating a misdemeanor offense under Alaska Stat. &sect; 1130.240. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that defendant qualified as an officer at common law. The description of his duties and powers, including his responsibility as the custodian of the records of criminal proceedings and his power to collect money from the public, indicated a public trust was reposed in him. Section 250 had as its underlying purpose the punishment of those in a position of trust that interfered with, tampered with, or misappropriated public documents. Defendant's attorney failed to preserve a jury instruction issue by not making a specific objection. The court held that the criminal acts with which defendant was charged did not involve First Amendment rights and that the statute was not vague under the common law definition of the term &quot;officer.&quot; Defendant fell squarely within the prohibitions of &sect; 250 because his criminal acts of misappropriating traffic tickets clearly were the kinds of documents protected by &sect; 250.</SPAN></P>

Although the trial court granted the state's motion to compel discovery responses, the company still failed to comply with the discovery requests. It wasn't until the state moved for judgment by default that the company belatedly complied with the discovery requests and opposed the motion by claiming excusable neglect. After the trial court denied the state's motion for default judgment, the state filed its notice of voluntary dismissal. On appeal, the state argued that the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees to the company because its lawsuit was terminated by the filing of the notice of dismissal.

Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied. Defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere to the charge, preserving his right to appeal. On appeal, defendant claimed that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad because it infringed on the First Amendment right of adults to possess literature, the right of adults to privacy in their homes, and the right of juveniles to control their own sexual development. The court affirmed, holding that because overbreadth analysis was generally available only to challenge statutes which arguably chilled exercise of First Amendment rights, the overbreadth doctrine was inapplicable to the facts of the case. The court stated that while the terms &quot;lewd and lascivious&quot; taken by themselves seemed imprecise, &sect; 11.15.134(a) was not impermissibly vague because the statute gave fair warning of the lewd and lascivious acts proscribed. The court construed the statute to require physical contact with the child's body and then ruled that the statute prohibited conduct that a state could constitutionally prohibit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state, the United States, and the Alaskans, entered into a three-way land exchange. During the pendency of a federal court action concerning the transaction, the Alaskans obtained legislative relief in the Act. The taxpayers questioned the validity of legislative or executive consent to the exchange. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's declaratory judgment and vacated the injunction. The court found that the taxpayers had standing to challenge the Act. Nevertheless, the court found that the constitution contained no restriction on alienation of mineral rights. The court rejected the idea that the constitution was amended by legislation, instead finding that Alaskans had entered into a compact with the federal government restricting alienation of lands by ratifying their constitution and separately approving the legislation to become a state. The court held that the proposed exchange was an amendment of the compact that did not require amendment of the state constitution. Finally, the court held that since the Act was a general act, it prevailed over any specific acts that restricted alienation of mineral rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State of Alaska sought review of a trial court (Alaska) decision, which granted the motions for summary judgment offered by appellee corporations, which operated fish-processing ships, on the State's claim for payment of the four percent &quot;floating&quot; tax due under Alaska Stat. &sect; 43.75.060 and on part of appellees' cross-claim to recover an alleged overpayment of those taxes. One appellee challenged the denial of part of the cross-claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State contended that the trial court erred in ruling that the processors should have been subjected to the lower tax rate. The processor whose overpayment claim was denied challenged the determination that its claims were barred by the statute of limitations. The court held that because neither appellee, which were factory ships, was &quot;attached to land&quot; as contemplated in Alaska Stat. &sect; 43.75.060(3), they qualified as &quot;floating&quot; processors of fish. &quot;Attachment&quot; meant some physical attachment or permanent berthing. However, appellees were entitled to the lower one percent tax rate for &quot;shorebased&quot; processors because the taxable years at issue predated the effective date of the amendment of &sect; 43.75.060. However, the court reversed with respect to the determination that certain overpayment claims were time-barred, finding that it was patently unfair for the State to assert the statute of limitations when appellees, in good faith, had delayed their overpayment claims by entering into a stipulation with the State. The court concluded by finding that the statute did not violate the state or federal equal protection guarantees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part as to the tax rate determination, reversed in part as to the denial of a portion of appellees' cross-claim, and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction on two specifications of error, one asserting a theory of federal pre-emption and the other claiming that &sect; 16.05.920(a) did not apply to the area in which he was fishing. The superior court's decision was announced in a single sentence referencing one case that dealt with due process limitations on state police powers and a second case that invoked the doctrine of federal exclusivity.

The court ruled that the enforcement of the State's regulatory scheme was within the sphere of the State's prerogative to regulate extraterritorial fishing.

The slides contained images of nude, male children. Defendant was convicted of lewd and lascivious acts toward a child and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The court reversed defendant's convictions because the trial court failed to suppress the photographic slides unlawfully seized by the officers. The &quot;plain view&quot; doctrine was inapplicable because nothing about the slides suggested that they contained marijuana, and &quot;but for&quot; the action of the officers in lifting them to the light, the incriminating nature of the slides would not have been revealed. At the point the officers probed the slides, it was not &quot;immediately apparent&quot; that the slides were evidence of a crime, and only after the officers probed further in violation of the warrant did incriminating evidence fall into view. Defendant exhibited an actual expectation of privacy in his slides by storing them on a shelf in his apartment. Defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his home under U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, while on probation for a burglary conviction, was picked up for a traffic violation. The police seized marijuana that they discovered in a paper bag in the car.

At defendant's probation revocation hearing based on the same evidence, the superior court found that it was bound by the prior finding of illegality of the search and dismissed the State's petition seeking probation revocation. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that Alaska R. Crim. P. 26(g), which provided that illegally obtained evidence could not be used for any purpose, did not apply to a probation revocation proceeding. The court found that, although the rule appeared to be one of general applicability, to be applied in all proceedings, a probation or parole revocation proceeding was to be distinguished from normal adjudications of guilt at trial. The court concluded that application of the exclusionary rule to such proceedings would not achieve a deterrent effect on police conduct and would not promote rehabilitation of criminals as the probation system was intended to do.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the lessee's damages were fixed by stipulation. The court further held that the lessee was entitled to the depreciation in the value of the bar equipment resulting from its removal from its original location. The court determined that a loan lessee received did not offset the loss of the lessee's profits because the loan was used to acquire new premises. Also, the exclusion of the evidence of resale was proper because it was irrelevant to the question of value. Lastly, the court found that the award of attorney's fees was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fishermen became gear license holders after January 1, 1973 and were unable to submit an application for a commercial fishing entry permit under &sect; 16.43.260(a). The fishermen argued that the date utilized in &sect; 16.43.260(a) violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court rejected the Commission's contention that the date provision was necessary to stem the rush for gear licenses because the means for stopping the gear rush was accomplished by the previously inserted provision requiring that applicants show hardship. Using a new, more demanding rational basis test, the court held that holding a gear license before January 1, 1973 did not bear a fair and substantial relation to the purpose of the legislation, which was the segregation of hardship and non-hardship cases. Section 16.43.260(a) was underinclusive because many fishermen who could demonstrate significant economic hardship were automatically excluded from receiving entry permits. It was overbroad because it allowed those who had long since retired from commercial fishing to apply for permits. Thus, the court held that &sect; 16.43.260(a) violated the fishermen's equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the Commission and found the challenged provision unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court previously declared the child a delinquent based on a finding of willful failure to comply with certain court orders made after a prior adjudication that she was a child in need of supervision in violation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.50.010. The finding was based on evidence that the child had been a runaway almost constantly since the time the superior court had released her from a youth detention center. The child sought to have her adjudication of delinquency set aside on the grounds that a child in need of supervision could not be prosecuted for criminal contempt or, in the alternative, if such a prosecution was allowable, such prosecution could not result in incarceration. The court affirmed, holding that the state's means of incarceration were closely and substantially related to the appropriate government interest of protecting children from various harms. The court noted that the child failed to abide by orders regarding her supervision, which constituted willful criminal contempt of the court's authority, and that she was therefore properly declared a delinquent and subject to the sanctions available for the correction of a delinquent minor's behavior.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with shellfish offenses for harvesting king crab against state emergency regulations promulgated by the Alaska Board of Fish and Game. The Alaska trial courts dismissed the charges, holding that the state had no jurisdiction to enforce the regulations. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a resident and nonresidents, were charged with possession or the harvesting of king crab within and without Alaska's three-mile limit. In the consolidated appeal, the court reversed and held that Alaska had jurisdiction and a legitimate interest to control the crab population and preserve the natural resource. The court found that the doctrine of federal exclusivity failed because Congress abstained from exercising its Commerce Clause power to regulate fishing in territorial waters in favor of local, non-uniform management of fisheries resources. The court held that the federal government did not preempt the field because the Outer Continental Shelf Land Act, 43 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1331 et seq., only covered seabed mineral resources and sedentary marine species, not organic marine life resources. The court further found that Alaska properly exercised its police power because it had a legitimate interest in crabs as a food resource. The court held that the jurisdiction went beyond the three-mile limit because crabs were migratory, and control outside the three-mile limit was necessary to control crabs within the limit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents alleged that they had been unconstitutionally denied the right to vote. During the election, the charter commission and its members were elected. The superior court declared the charter commission a valid public body authorized to proceed with its statutory functions under Alaska Stat. &sect; 29.68.240 et seq. The court affirmed. The Eagle River-Chugiak Borough was organized under 1974 Alaska Sess. Laws 145. The residents of the two boroughs patterned their actions on the assumption that two separate political entities were then in existence. Although the court's decision in another case voided the separation of the Eagle River-Chugiak Borough, it did not declare invalid actions taken in good faith following the seemingly separate status of the two political subdivisions. When denial of the right to vote, based on valid laws that did not create suspect classification, was weighed against the compelling state interest of stability in public affairs, and the denial bore a direct relation to the state interest, the court held that the balance weighed in favor of upholding the challenged election.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The testimony at a grand jury hearing established that defendant was an accessory to the sale of two pounds of marijuana by a juvenile co-defendant to an undercover agent. Evidence showed that defendant carried the drugs from the juvenile's car to the agent's car. Defendant was indicted for selling marijuana, and he moved to dismiss the indictment on constitutional grounds. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant plead nolo contendere to possession of marijuana and reserved his right to appeal a constitutional issue. On appeal, the court held that defendant's possession was constitutionally prohibited because it occurred in a public place instead of in his own home, and it was in connection with the sale of a substantial amount of marijuana. The court found that &sect; 17.12.010 did not invidiously discriminate against young persons, as its enforcement was not conducted in a way as to purposely single out young persons. The court found that the classification of marijuana as a dangerous drug was not arbitrary, as there was sufficient justification for the State's desire to control marijuana use. The court noted the State's desire to control drivers under the influence of marijuana.</SPAN></P>

The lieutenant governor, pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect; 15.45.210 (1960), determined that the measures were substantially the same and that the initiative was therefore void. The citizen sought a declaratory judgment to require the lieutenant governor to place the initiative on the ballot. On appeal, the citizen first contended that Alaska Stat. &sect; 15.45.210 (1960) was unconstitutional because the legislature improperly delegated a judicial function to an executive officer. The court held that the legislature had the right to delegate its responsibilities. The instant delegation was narrow and based on sound and practical considerations for a non-discretionary function. The citizen also contended that the Act, ch. 76 SLA 1974, and the initiative were not substantially similar. The meaning of the phrase &quot;substantially the same&quot; was elusive. Both clearly aimed at the control of election campaign contributions and expenditures, but the court agreed that the Act effectively displaced the initiative.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile contended, on appeal, that the evidence should have been excluded and that his due process rights were violated. The court affirmed the ruling and held that the evidence secured by the foster mother was properly admitted because the foster mother was not an agent of the state for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. The police did not institute the foster mother's actions, nor did foster mother intend to involve the police. While the juvenile's interrogation was custodial, the failure to give a Miranda warning was harmless because the juvenile court based its ruling on other evidence. Finally, the juvenile court properly indicated that it had not relied on the juvenile's prior record in adjudicating him a delinquent. A prior review was necessary only for the purpose of determining the proper interim detention.</SPAN></P>

After a hearing, the board sustained the non-retention decision.

The board also claimed that there was substantial evidence to support its decision and that the reversal thereof by the trial court was error. By cross-appeal one teacher claimed that Alaska Stat. &sect; 14.20.205 guaranteed him a trial de novo and that his case should not have been remanded to the board. By cross-appeal the other teacher contended that the trial court should have ordered her reinstated with full back pay. On appeal, the court remanded the cases for further proceedings finding that there were strong policy reasons for holding that tenured teachers had a mandatory right to a trial de novo and that the conditions for reinstatement with back pay were not present.</SPAN></P>

The board revoked the guide's license. The trial court affirmed the revocation. On appeal, the court affirmed the license revocation as well. The court found that the board's findings of criminality served as a basis for determining the guide's fitness, rather than as a basis for subjecting him to criminal penalties. The court also found that the sanction imposed was remedial in that it served the basic purpose of the licensing statutes, which was to ensure that only persons who were personally and morally fit were allowed to engage in guiding. Thus, the court concluded that the Alaska and Federal Constitutions did not entitle the guide to a jury trial.

I, &sect; 22, and the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged with possession of marijuana in violation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 17.12010. He filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that his arrest violated his rights to privacy and equal protection under the U.S. and Alaska Constitutions. The district court denied the motion, and the superior court affirmed. On appeal, the court held that privacy in the home was a fundamental right under both constitutions. However, the right had to yield when it interfered in a serious manner with the health, safety, or rights of others, or with the public welfare. The state had to meet a substantial burden of showing that proscription of possession of marijuana in the home was in the interest of public welfare. It did not meet that burden because the evidence presented did not prove that marijuana as presently used in the country was generally a danger to the user or others. The privacy of the home could not be breached absent a persuasive showing of a close and substantial relationship of the intrusion to a legitimate governmental interest. However, possession at home of amounts of marijuana indicative of intent to sell rather than for personal use was unprotected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was indicted for larceny. He was accused of finding and retaining items of personal property without taking steps prescribed by Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.20.260 to find the lawful owner. On appeal, the court found that the crucial question was whether the statutory crime of larceny was sufficiently related to the common law crime of misappropriation of lost property to justify the court's implication of intent. Appellant urged the court to imply clues of ownership requirement to bring statute into conformity with common law, and then imply the wrongful intent element. Alternatively, appellant contended that statute modified the common law requirement of immediate clue as to ownership by specifying two means of locating an owner. The court rejected both arguments and concluded that the statute did not codify the common law. Instead, it created a new, distinct offense and was unconstitutional because it omitted the requirement of criminal intent.</SPAN></P>

While the accused was at a hospital, a state trooper requested his consent for the taking of a sample of blood for the purpose of testing its alcohol content. When the accused refused to consent, a district judge obtained an oral order authorizing the withdrawal of his blood. The record demonstrated that no search warrant authorizing the taking of the blood sample was obtained prior to the withdrawal of the blood nor was the accused's arrest contemporaneous with the taking. An indictment was returned charging the accused with the offense of negligent homicide. One of the specific acts of negligence charged was that the accused operated a motor vehicle while intoxicated in violation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.030.The court reversed the superior court's order denying the accused's motion to suppress the blood-alcohol test findings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that the prohibition in &sect; 19 against local or special acts rendered invalid the Act, which created the Eagle River-Chugiak Borough, that the legislature created a borough by a local or special law when a general law was applicable, and that the &quot;general law&quot; constitutional provision controlled the operation of legislative power under Alaska Const. art. X, &sect; 3. Appellees argued that the legislative act was not local or special legislation, that if it was the constitutional prohibition did not apply because a general law could not have been made applicable to the Act's subject matter, and that the legislature possessed independent power under Alaska Const. art. X, &sect; 3 to create the borough. Reversing the superior court's holding, the court held that (1) the Act was both special and local legislation, in that its operation and scope were limited to the borough; (2) there was nothing in the nature of the area that justified a departure from the general law scheme of Alaska Stat. &sect; 29.18.030 et seq., for incorporating the new borough; and (3) the general grant of power in the constitution did not override the prohibition in Alaska Const. art.

The court further found that the attorney general, as part of the executive branch of the government, had discretionary control over the legal business of the state, including the initiation, prosecution, and disposition of cases. However, the court held that the lower court's order improperly interfered with the attorney general's discretionary power. Thus, the court reversed that part of the lower court's order that required the attorney general to prosecute this action. The court also held that the court trustee was not the proper party to prosecute this action because it would violate the doctrine of separation of powers.

The court reversed the superior court's judgment denying the taxpayer a jury trial to review the board's tax assessment and remanded the case for further proceedings.

A district court dismissed the complaint on the grounds that the section of the disorderly conduct statute was unconstitutional on its face, overbroad, and void for vagueness.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a passenger in a car which a police officer stopped in order to administer a sobriety test to the driver. Defendant continuously interrupted the tests. After the officer asked him to return to the car or leave, defendant raised his voice and used loud and obscene language. The officer said he saw two people turn on their house lights and look out their windows. The court concluded that the statutory provision was constitutional but that it had to be construed in a manner that avoided violating the First Amendment. The court said that the statute prohibited in a public place, when a criminal offense had occurred, a refusal to comply with a lawful order of the police to disperse. The court explained that the construction answered the assertions that the statute was overbroad and void for vagueness because it had no application to constitutionally protected speech or conduct and was not vague. The statutory construction sufficiently defined the parameters of the prohibited conduct to provide due process notice and avoid arbitrary enforcement. The court determined, however, that as a matter of law the evidence was insufficient to warrant a conviction under the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporate motor carriers appealed the portion of a judgment which denied a permanent injunction against a statutory grandfather clause after concluding that an invalid residency requirement was severable from the remainder of the statute. The state and the department of transportation cross-appealed the portion of the judgment invalidating the residency requirement, urging that the provision did not violate equal protection because the classification based on carrier residency was rationally related to securing an adequate supply of economic, dependable transportation and inhibiting unfair competition. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the invalid provision which restricted expanded authority to certain resident corporations did not further the state goal because making certain carriers' routes co-extensive with their interstate authority was not accomplished any less by non-resident carriers' incorporation in other states. The court further explained that the invalid provision was severable because the primary intent of the legislature was able to be effected by merely extending the special privilege conferred upon resident carriers to the excluded carriers.</SPAN></P>

The State then appealed from the order of the superior court directing entry of judgment of acquittal on remand to the district court. Defendant requested that the State's appeal be dismissed, claiming that the State was without right of appeal in criminal cases other than to test the sufficiency of the indictment or to appeal a sentence. The court held that double jeopardy did not preclude the State from appealing the final order of the superior court because the superior court was acting as an intermediate appellate court when it reversed defendant's conviction.

Appellants argued that the claims were barred or prematurely brought.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lieutenant governor approved an application of an initiative committee that sought to introduce an act to relocate the state capital. It was determined by the lieutenant governor that the initiative satisfied the proper form detailed by Alaska Stat. &sect; 15.45.040. The trial court granted the citizen's motion for summary judgment based on the conclusion that the exclusion of sites for the new capital rendered the initiative unconstitutional under Alaska Const. art. XI, &sect; 7 that prohibited use of the initiative to enact local or special legislation. The court affirmed the judgment in part, finding that the trial court had jurisdiction and that the action was not barred by a 30-day appeal period because the citizen did not get notice of the lieutenant governor's decision. The court noted that whether an initiative petition related to an excluded matter was a justiciable question and that the action was not premature. However, the court held that the trial court's analysis that the site exclusion made the petition local or special legislation was erroneous because no rational basis inquiry was made. The court found that reasonable factual bases were present for the site exclusions.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found the durational residency requirement was subject to strict judicial scrutiny. The court held the durational residency requirement was not unconstitutional because the state had a compelling state interest in assuring that legislators resided in the sate a sufficient time to have gained an understanding of the history of the state and the needs and the problems of the residents. The court determined the impact the residency requirement had upon the voters' right to have a meaningful choice of candidates was slight where during the brief period of delay, the voters remained free to vote for anyone who could lawfully run.

The resident's action alleged that the borough had illegally taken over the operation and control of the sewer system of the city, thereby harming him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident argued that the borough's assumption of the city sewer system was illegal because it was not a legal municipal corporation and because the city's charter prohibited the transfer of municipally owned utilities without an election that followed certain procedures. In affirming, the court held that there was a valid statute under which the borough could and did incorporate. Because the resident made no claim concerning the other elements necessary to establish de facto municipal existence, the trial court properly ruled that the borough was a valid entity as against a collateral attack. The court found that a municipal ordinance was not necessarily invalid because it was inconsistent or in conflict with a state statute. The question rested on whether the exercise of authority had been prohibited to municipalities. The prohibition was express in the resident's case. The statutes established a procedure by which certain city powers could be transferred to a second class borough and precluded a city from exercising a power once that power was being exercised area-wide. That then presented a clear case in which statutory authority overrode a provision in a home rule charter.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the use of the 1970 census did not constitute error, and it was reasonable for the board to conclude that civilian transients were not present in significant numbers when the census data was obtained, and thus they were not included in the Alaska census population. The court held that it was reasonable for the board to exclude some proportion of military personnel because a significant number of Alaska-based military personnel exercised an option to be non-Alaskans, despite their physical presence there. The court concluded that in the absence of a showing that the manner of reapportioning a state was improperly motivated or had an impermissible effect, along with there finding that the decision of the board had a rational basis, the reapportionment plan was held to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As an initial matter, the court rejected defendant's contention that the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutionally vague, finding that the statute was not so vague that men of ordinary intelligence could not have known within the bounds of reasonable certainty which activities were proscribed by Alaska Stat. &sect; 46.03.710. The court noted that the mere fact that the statute was so framed as to require a jury upon occasion to determine a question of reasonableness was not sufficient to make the statute too vague. The court further found that the statute manifested a legislative intention that direct criminal prosecution was permissible. The court additionally found that defendant was properly held individually liable where there was sufficient evidence to show that he &quot;consented&quot; to the violation, in the sense that he had the power and authority to abate the nuisance, but permitted it to worsen. The court accordingly affirmed, concluding that the penalty provisions under which defendant were sentenced did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment nor were they so completely arbitrary and shocking to the sense of justice that they had to be stricken.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that pursuant to Alaska R. Crim. P. 26(a), the State was entitled to impeach its witness by his prior inconsistent statements. Further, based on the facts adduced in the State's case in chief, the trial court properly found that reasonable men could differ on the question of guilt, and that the case was properly sent to the jury. Finally, Alaska R. Crim. P. 12(e) did not foreclose constitutional challenges not made prior to the date of trial. Moreover, the failure to raise the constitutional defense at the pretrial omnibus hearing did not constitute a waiver because under Alaska R. Crim. P. 16(f)(3), the failure of the indictment to show jurisdiction or the offense charged was an express exception to the issues waived. However, because there was no evidentiary hearing below on whether Alaska Stat. &sect; 17.12.010 was necessary to further a compelling state interest, there could be no final disposition of the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from a trial court (Alaska) convicting him of assault with a dangerous weapon upon his plea of nolo contendere. Although defendant twice waived his speedy trial right under Alaska R. Crim. P. 45 in order to obtain psychiatric evaluations, he claimed on appeal that his speedy trial right was violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the district attorney failed to take adequate precautions once it received a copy of the second psychiatric report to assure prompt calendaring of the case. After a pre-trial hearing, the superior court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment for speedy trial violations. Defendant then entered a negotiated plea of nolo contendere in which he expressly reserved the right to appeal the speedy trial issue. The court found no error below. The court upheld the express agreement for a limited appeal right on the speedy trial issue. If a nolo contendere plea expressly conditioned upon a limited right of appeal was adopted by the superior court, the failure of the judicial system to respect that express condition would likely render the nolo plea unintelligent and invalid. However, the court held that no speedy trial violation occurred. Because it was the public defender who requested the delay in the trial date, the responsibility rested as much with him as with the district attorney to see that the psychiatric report was brought to the attention of the superior court so that the case could be recalendared.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife's divorce complaint alleged the one-year residency requirement in Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.55.140 (Michie) infringed upon her fundamental rights to interstate travel, due process, and equal protection. When the superior court concluded that &sect; 09.55.140 violated the state and federal equal protection clauses, the State sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court noted that durational residency requirements were valid only if they served a compelling state interest, and concluded that the State's interest in protecting the family unit and assuring the validity of its divorce decrees was insufficient to justify an abridgement of the right to interstate travel. Noting that the statute did nothing to preserve the marriages of long-term residents and did not individuate actions involving children, the court concluded that the statute did not further the State's interest in protecting families. Moreover, the court found that the statute did not further the State's interest in assuring the validity of its divorce decrees, noting that there was no evidence that a subjective test for domicile would have encouraged fraudulent use of the State's courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city petitioned the Local Boundary Commission for an extension to its boundaries. The proposed annexation comprised 274 square miles, of which the corporation owned less than one square mile. After the annexation was approved, the corporation claimed that the attempted annexation was a step-annexation and was void because, inter alia, the Commission failed follow the procedures outlined by the step-annexation legislation, Alaska Stat. &sect; 44.19.260. The city denied that the annexation was a step-annexation and asserted immunity under the doctrine of de facto municipal incorporation. On appeal, the court found that because the city did not request, and the Commission did not certify, a step-annexation, the requirements for step-annexation were not applicable. In addition, the doctrine of de facto municipal incorporation insulated an annexation from collateral attack where, as here, the annexation was attempted under a proper statute, a good faith effort was made to comply with the statute, the statute was colorably complied with, and the municipality exercised its powers in good faith within the annexed territory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised the issue of an improper post-indictment identification for the first time on appeal. The court affirmed the judgment and found that the improper identification issue had not been waived.

The right to subpoena by an indigent defendant encompassed in Alaska R. Crim. P. 17(b) extended to expert as well as non-expert witnesses. The right to have a witness subpoenaed at state expense was not absolute. The superior court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion to retain an expert witness. Neither the denial of the services of a paraffin test expert at state expense nor the tactical choices criticized by defendant deprived him of effective assistance of counsel. The motion to disqualify the trial judge was untimely. The court held that the sentence imposed violated the provision against double jeopardy found in Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his application for post-conviction relief, defendant contended that certain of his conferences with his attorney were electronically monitored by the jail authorities. The court held that defendant's allegation of eavesdropping upon attorney-client communications presented a genuine issue of material fact such that an evidentiary hearing was required. The court noted that there was little doubt that this unresolved factual issue was material, because interceptions of attorney-client communications violated due process of law and the right to the effective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, the court remanded the case to the superior court to determine, after a full evidentiary hearing, whether defendant's conferences with his attorney were electronically monitored. Defendant also alleged in his application that the district attorney, by resort to threats and intimidation, prevented potential defense witnesses from testifying. The court held that the facts as alleged required an evidentiary hearing in order to ascertain whether such intimidation occurred.

Since the production of a list of names and addresses of witnesses was testimonial in nature, incriminating, and compelled by court order, the court held that this portion of the trial court's discovery order violated defendant's privilege against self-incrimination under Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The court also held that the portion of the trial court's order, which commanded the production of alibi information concerning the place or places the accused claims to have been also offended defendant's privilege against self-incrimination under the state constitution.

Upon affirming the judgment, the court held that under Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.45.070(a), it was not necessary that the buyers allege that they were ever in possession of the premises in order to state a cause of action for forcible detainer. However, upon the resident's petition for a rehearing, the court held that the requirement that the resident post a bond that was equal to twice the rental value of the property as a condition of his appeal of the adverse judgment violated the equal protection guarantees of both the United States and the Alaska Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants claimed that Alaska Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 11 and 12, and the Act created a right to bail. Although the court found that U.S. Const. amend. VIII did not include an unqualified right to bail that applied to the states, the court held that the 1967 amendments to the Act did not permit the detention of persons without bail. Thus, the court held that the lower court erred in denying bail to the defendant who requested bail at his arraignment. However, the court dismissed the other two appeals because one defendant had been afforded an opportunity to be released into an alcohol abuse program and the other defendant sought bail in a probation revocation hearing, where the right to bail did not attach. The court found that the Alaska Constitution guaranteed an accused's right to be released on bail except for capital offenses. The court also found that a criminal defendant was entitled to bail before conviction as a matter of right, unless it was determined that the release would not reasonably assure the person's appearance, or would pose a danger to other persons and the community. Thus, the court held that the Act did not permit detention without bail.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the State of Alaska, sought review of the denial by a trial court (Alaska) of its motion to dismiss a suit filed by respondents, a parolee and his wife, based on the contention that the statute of limitations ran during the period that the parolee was on parole so as to bar the suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parolee was a passenger in a Mack tractor-trailer, owned and operated by a motor freight company. At the time of the accident, the parolee was a prisoner confined in the state jail at Anchorage and was on an authorized work release. Subsequent to the injury, the parolee was placed on parole. The parolee and his wife commenced the present action in the superior court naming the State as a codefendant with the motor freight company. The State moved to dismiss the complaint, and the trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the State argued that because parole was the interruption of the execution of the sentence, the statute of limitations began to run again at the time of the release on parole. The court found that the right to initiate civil suit was a right suspended by Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.05.070 and that under Alaska Stat. &sect; 33.15.190 parolees, similar to convicts, were subject to this disability. The parolee was entitled to rely on the literal reading of the statutes as they then existed in delaying his suit until after his release from parole. Thus, the parolee had two years after release from parole in which to file suit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's denial of the State's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

Parolee argued that Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.05.070, if interpreted to foreclose the parolee from bringing a tort action under the circumstances presented, violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the Alaska and United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parolee's accident occurred while he was a felon on parole. While still on parole, he filed a personal injury action against the tortfeasors but the trial court granted the tortfeasors' motion to dismiss on the basis that Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.05.070 suspended the civil rights of a person sentenced to imprisonment for less than a life term. On appeal, the parolee contended that the trial court misinterpreted the statute or, alternatively, that the statute as interpreted violated the United States and Alaska Constitutions. The court reversed, holding that &sect; 11.05.070 combined with Alaska Stat. &sect; 33.15.190 to deny parolees the right to bring and maintain civil suits. The court concluded that &sect; 33.15.190 was unconstitutional because it violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clause of the United States and Alaska Constitutions. The state's interest in denying parolees the right to bring civil actions while on parole satisfied neither the compelling state interest test applicable when a fundamental right was at issue nor the rational basis test more generally applicable. The court could find no rationale behind the parolee's deprivation of access to the courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment dismissing the parolee's personal injury action against the tortfeasors and remanded the case to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident filed an action seeking to enjoin the enforcement of personnel regulations, which gave an absolute hiring preference to persons who had resided in the state for at least one year. The trial court held that the durational residence requirement penalized the exercise of the federal constitutional right of interstate travel and denied the resident's right of equal protection and, therefore, granted the resident's motion for summary judgment. The state appealed. On appeal, the state argued that the trial court erred by subjecting the personnel rules to strict scrutiny under the compelling state interest equal protection standard. However, the court held that the constitutional challenge to the durational residency regulations could not be answered by the argument that public employment was a privilege and not a right. Further, the court held that discriminatory treatment based on the suspect classification of recent state travel was itself a sufficient independent trigger to bring into play the compelling state interest test. Therefore, the court held that the residency requirement could not stand because it was not necessary to promote a compelling state interest.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also denied his motion to suppress a statement given to a private investigator. On appeal, defendant argued that Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.20.020 was unconstitutional, that he was denied a speedy trial, and that the statement should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The private investigator was working closely with the police as an arson investigator, had promised to turn over any statement to the police, and had enlisted the police's help to gain access to defendant who was incarcerated. The court determined that although intent was not specifically mentioned in the portion of the second degree arson statute that referred to one who aided, counseled, or procured the burning of a building, criminal intent was required as a necessary element of the crime. Thus, &sect; 11.20.020 was constitutional. The court found that the interval between indictment and trial was about 10 months, but something less than six months of the delay was attributable to the state. The court concluded that defendant failed to show actual prejudice on his speedy trial argument. However, the court reversed and concluded that the investigator was required to give a Miranda warning. Rather than showing that defendant expressly waived his rights, the record indicated that he refused to give a statement if it were to be regarded as a waiver of those rights. The state had failed to demonstrate waiver. Thus, the confession and any of its fruits could not be utilized at any retrial.</SPAN></P>

The superior court granted a preliminary injunction, but later granted the city's motion for summary judgment. The citizens sought to stay the superior court's order. The court denied the citizens' application to stay the order because the citizens were required to file their application for a stay with the superior court. Alaska R.

Thereafter, the motorcyclist filed his complaint. The trial court upheld the regulations. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. Under the circumstances and the statutory presumption of validity, the trial court properly found that there was no substantial failure to comply with the notice requirements of Alaska Stat. &sect; 44.62.200(3), which required the notice to include an informative summary of the proposed subject. Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.05.030(a) specifically authorized the Commissioner to adopt regulations governing rules of the road, the operation of vehicles on the roadways, and equipment to be carried on such vehicles. Such power included the regulation of safety apparel and the regulation of motorcycle construction. The regulations bore a reasonable relation to protection of the public and were sufficiently specific to withstand a vagueness attack.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ex-husband and ex-wife were divorced but living together when the ex-husband was killed in a job-related accident.

The employer and carrier sought review after the trial court affirmed the award, arguing that the ex-wife was not a &quot;surviving wife&quot; as defined under the Worker's Compensation Act, Alaska Stat. &sect; 23.30.215(a), because she and the ex-husband had not obtained a license and solemnized a marriage as required by Alaska Stat. &sect; 25.05.011 at the time of the accident. The court, noting that the term &quot;surviving wife&quot; was not defined, referred to the definitions of &quot;married&quot; and &quot;widow&quot; found in Alaska Stat. &sect; 23.30.265. The ex-husband, though divorced, was &quot;married&quot; under &sect; 23.30.265(15) because he was required by the divorce decree to contribute to the ex-wife's support. Further, the ex-wife also qualified as a &quot;widow&quot; under &sect; 23.30.265(21) because she was living with the ex-husband at the time of his death and depended on him for support. While common law marriages were generally held invalid, the court declined to apply the principle in the area of worker's compensation law. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

P. 89 was unconstitutional under the state and federal constitutions while defendant court clerk cross appealed that the attachee did not adequately represent his named class and that the declaratory judgment suit was not mooted by his consent judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A creditor filed suit against the attachee and with a writ of attachment from the clerk, attached his checking account without notice. The attachee tried to quash attachment, but upon denial, filed a class action against the clerk seeking declaratory judgment that Alaska R. Civ. P. 89 was unconstitutional. Both parties sought summary judgment, but the court found for the clerk. Both parties appealed. The court considered whether summary prejudgment attachment of property violated state and federal due process guarantees. It held that Rule 89 did not afford the attachee a meaningful opportunity for a hearing before seizure process issued by the state upon ex parte application of another person. The creditor made no showing that the attachee intended to conceal or transfer his property to avoid judgment. There was no special state or creditor interest that justified summary attachment. The attachee was a resident of the forum, and the creditor could have obtained personal jurisdiction over him. Thus, summary property attachment under Rule 89 was unconstitutional. The case was not moot, and the attachee could properly maintain the class action.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the lower court's memorandum opinion and order constituted an appealable final judgment. The court held that the Alaska Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court previously declared a reapportionment plan adopted in 1971 unconstitutional under the equal protection and supremacy clauses of the United States Constitution because the proposed plan, in its overall reapportionment of the Senate and House of Representatives, would have established election districts which failed to encompass as nearly equal population proportions as was practicable. The court ordered that an interim reapportionment and redistricting plan be designed to meet the imminent 1972 elections and appointed magistrates to assist the court in fashioning the appropriate plan. The court adopted the interim reapportionment plan which used the total population base for the State of Alaska, including the military population at the time of the 1970 census. The petitioner filed objections to the court's order, asserting that Alaska Const. art. VI, &sect; 3 required reapportionment be based upon the civilian population. The court overruled the objections, holding that art. VI, &sect; 3 was unconstitutional because it eliminated the military from the population base as a class of persons in violation of equal protection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court denied defendant's request to have counsel appointed on the ground that it held no authority to do so. The superior court affirmed the ruling on the ground that Alaska Dist. Ct. R. Crim. P. 1(j) provided in misdemeanor cases that Alaska Sup. Ct. R. Crim. P. 39(b) and 15(c), relating to the appointment of counsel for indigent defendants, had no application. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that in any criminal prosecution the accused should have the right to be represented by counsel. The court saw no justifiable reason for defining &quot;criminal prosecution&quot; any differently in relation to the right to the assistance of counsel than in relation to the right to trial by jury. The court ruled that the right to the assistance of counsel meant that counsel must be appointed at public expense to a misdemeanor defendant who was indigent and too poor to have his own lawyer. The court reasoned that the nature of the injustice is no different where counsel is denied to an indigent defendant in a misdemeanor case within the category of a &quot;criminal prosecution.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtors fell into arrears on a credit card account and the creditor instituted collection proceedings by hiring the attorney to pursue the debtors for payment. The debtors filed an action against the creditor and the attorney alleging they employed harassing and unethical debt collection practices. The debtors obtained legal representation from the State's Legal Services rather than retain private counsel. Because Legal Services represented the debtors, no filing fee for the creditor's action was required. The attorney filed a motion for an order to show cause why the debtors were unable to pay the filing fee and hire private counsel. The trial court entered the show cause order. The debtors moved to quash the show cause order and the trial court denied the motion. The debtors sought interlocutory review. The court found that the rule exempting Legal Services from paying filing fees was different from the rule involving in forma pauperis procedures, that the debtors' action was within Legal Services' authority, and that show cause orders were barred because they were not provided for in the Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure.</SPAN></P>

The court held defendant's sentences for both larceny and burglary did not inflict an impermissible double jeopardy punishment where Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.20.040 only prohibited successive prosecutions and neither burglary nor larceny was an inferior degree or lesser included offense of the other. The court determined burglary was completed pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.20.100 when there was a breach of entry and that the gist of larceny was the theft itself pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.20.150. The court concluded defendant could be convicted of burglary even if there had been a successful theft and that conviction and punishment under both statutes was legal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment that convicted defendant of one count of burglary not in a dwelling, one count of larceny in a building, and one count of possession of firearms by a convict. The court also affirmed defendant's sentences.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had telephoned a trooper and complained at length regarding the trooper's effectiveness. Defendant claimed that the charge failed to state an offense, and if it did, it was an unconstitutional application of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant regularly telephoned the local resident trooper and complained of the trooper's qualifications and performance. The complaint stated that defendant did unlawfully conduct himself in a disorderly manner by telephoning a trooper and berating him with loud and abusive language. Defendant was convicted of disorderly conduct and disturbance of the peace, which was affirmed on appeal, and defendant sought further review. The court held that: (1) pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. I, and Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 5, no law could abridge the freedom of speech; (2) defendant's language did not rise to the level of profanity that could constitutionally be reached by the criminal law; (3) defendant's communication did not constitute &quot;fighting words,&quot; face-to-face utterances that provoked an immediate violent response; (4) freedom of speech, though not absolute, was nevertheless protected against censorship or punishment, unless likely to produce a clear and present danger of a serious substantive evil far above public inconvenience, annoyance, or unrest; and (5) defendant's conduct did not constitute a crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that convicted defendant of disorderly conduct and disturbance of the peace and remanded the cause with direction that the complaint be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An undercover narcotics agent was introduced to defendant. Defendant sold heroin and marijuana to the agent. Defendant first contended that the trial court erred in denying his application to inspect the minutes of the agent's testimony before the grand jury, claiming a discrepancy between the grand jury and trial testimony. The issue was moot because the grand jury minutes did not contain notes of the agent's testimony. There was no rule that grand jury proceedings should be recorded. Defendant also contended that he was prejudiced by the State's questioning of a witness to one of the drug transactions between defendant and the agent. The court held that questioning on whether the witness was presently under indictment was proper inquiry when limited to the witness's possible bias or interest. Defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal was properly denied because there was no evidence of unlawful entrapment. A strong inference could be drawn that defendant was willing to engage in the drug transactions wholly independent of the agent's pleas to his humanitarian and pecuniary motives. Finally, the court found that the delay before indictment was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile sought review of a decision of the trial court (Alaska), which adjudicated him a delinquent based on a finding that he unlawfully sold lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) to a police informant. The juvenile challenged the constitutionality of Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.10.070, which provided that all children's hearings were without a jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state alleged that the juvenile had unlawfully sold LSD to a police informant, and the juvenile was adjudicated a delinquent. On appeal, the court vacated, reversed, and remanded. The juvenile argued that he was denied his constitutional right to a jury. Under &sect; 47.10.070, all children's hearings were without a jury. The court held that where the juvenile was charged with acts that would be a crime subject to incarceration if committed by an adult, the Alaska Constitution guaranteed him the right to a jury trial. Process was not properly served on the juvenile, but where his attorney failed to object to the defect, it was waived. The trial court committed reversible error when the juvenile was absent from a hearing on an essential element in the case: whether the tablet at issue contained LSD. Limiting the juvenile's attorney to asking the informant if he was paid to give information unduly restricted cross-examination. Cross-examination to show bias because of expectation of immunity from prosecution was essential to a fair trial, and undue limitation on such cross-examination was reversible error. The trial court's failure to provide written findings of fact was error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's adjudicative and dispositive orders in the juvenile's case were vacated and reversed, and the matter was remanded for appropriate proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgement of the Superior Court, Third Judicial Circuit, Anchorage (Alaska), which convicted him of rape subsequent to his indictment, plea of not guilty, and trial on the charge. Defendant sought reversal of his conviction contending that the jury which found him guilty was improperly constituted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court had a longstanding practice of selecting all prospective jurors from the area within a 15 mile radius of Anchorage. This practice had precluded residents from Chignik and for that matter residents of virtually all native villages from representation on the jury panel. The record on appeal disclosed that no native jurors appeared on the panel summoned for defendant's trial. The prosecution sought to establish that defendant had forcibly raped his 14-year-old sister-in-law. The court found that the differences between a native village and the city of Anchorage were neither simple nor superficial; they were not restricted to a single element such as occupation or income. Because the source from which defendant's jury was drawn excluded virtually all residents of native villages in the third judicial district, the court was constrained to find that the jury empanelled in this case could not have adequately represented a fair cross section of the community in which the crime occurred, and that it therefore could not be deemed impartial. Therefore the court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
