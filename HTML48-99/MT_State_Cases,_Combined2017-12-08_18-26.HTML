</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Indian tribes had water rights on their reservation. Respondents asserted they had authority under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 85-2-311 to issue water use permits on the reservation. The court held that it could exercise original jurisdiction over the issue since petitioners demonstrated that tribal water rights were of statewide importance, and since the decisive issue was purely constitutional and the normal litigation process was inadequate. Petitioners possessed reserved water rights on the reservation pursuant to Mont. Const. art. IX, &sect; 3(1), which they were attempting to quantify. The court construed the statute to mean respondents could only issue permits with respect to legally available water. Legally available water did not include water reserved for Indian tribes. Respondents could not determine whether the water was legally available on petitioners' reservation because they could not determine whether the issuance of permits would affect existing water rights until petitioners' rights were quantified.</SPAN></P>

After she settled that lawsuit, respondent setoff the settlement amount against the future monthly workers' compensation death benefits payable to petitioner, resulting in termination of those benefits. She sued respondent challenging the termination of benefits and the constitutionality of the statute allowing the setoff. The Workers' Compensation Court concluded that respondent's termination of benefits was proper and upheld the constitutionality of the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued defendant for wrongful discharge. Plaintiff alleged that defendant's motive for the discharge was that his fringe benefits were greater than those of other workers with the same annual earnings. The parties ultimately agreed to arbitration. The arbitrator dismissed on the grounds that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1001, et seq., required exclusive federal court jurisdiction. The district court confirmed and denied plaintiff's request to amend to remove the motive allegations. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that plaintiff waived his right to object on appeal by failing to object either at arbitration or in district court on the issue of ERISA preemption, and that the district court lost jurisdiction to allow plaintiff to amend the complaint when the parties agreed to arbitration. Once the parties agreed to arbitration, the district court could only confirm, modify and confirm, or vacate and remand for rehearing.</SPAN></P>

As a result, defendant's conviction for violating the protective order would stand. The court declined to address defendant's challenge to the separation requirement in the protective order as an unconstitutional infringement of his right to travel because the trial court's sentence and judgment were affirmable based on the court's conclusion that defendant's conviction of the protection order was valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizens' action group challenged 14 school trust lands statutes. The trial court permanently enjoined 11 statutes. On appeal the court held Mont.

Code Ann. &sect; 77-1-208 did not violate the full market value trust requirement. In authorizing firewood permits without charges for commercially valuable wood on school trust lands, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 77-5-211&nbsp;unconstitutionally violated the trust mandate and the State's undivided loyalty duty. Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 77-6-304 was facially unconstitutional because it violated the undivided loyalty duty, benefiting third parties to the detriment of the trust's beneficiaries. Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 77-6-305 was facially unconstitutional since it did not allow a new lease to issue until the old lessee had been paid for his improvements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State appealed the District Court of the First Judicial District, County of Lewis and Clark's (Montana) grant of plaintiff medical professionals' motion for a preliminary injunction in suit which sought a determination that Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 37-20-103 and 50-20-109 violated the privacy provisions of the Montana Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff clinic, physicians, and physician assistants-certified filed suit, challenging the constitutionality of Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 37-20-103 and 50-20-109, which prohibited physician assistants-certified from performing abortions. After it found that plaintiffs had standing to challenge the statute on behalf of female patients, the court ruled that the right of privacy was a fundamental right, and, as such, applied a strict-scrutiny analysis. The court held that the statutes violated the right to privacy under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 10, because the statutes were a disguised attempt to limit patient access to a pre-viability abortion, and the legislation was not justified by a compelling state interest. The fundamental right to personal and procreative autonomy and to individual privacy prohibits the government from dictating, approving, or condemning values, beliefs, and matters ultimately involving individual conscience, where opinions about the nature of such values and beliefs are seriously divided.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction and determined the case on its merits. A statute which prohibited physician assistants-certified from performing abortions violated the privacy, equal protection, and bill of attainder provisions of the Montana Constitution because there lacked a compelling state interest.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the verdict and the judgment, because the patron's conduct of driving a vehicle while intoxicated, through the wall of the tavern, was a foreseeable intervening cause that did not serve to supersede or break the causal chain between defendant's original negligence and the injury to plaintiff. The trial court did not err in excluding evidence of criminal proceedings against the patron or in allowing testimony regarding an estimate of the patron's blood alcohol concentration.

Respondent also contended that removal violated his due process rights. Court first held that the removal statutes at issue were jurisdictional in nature, as they afforded trial court the right to exercise discretional jurisdiction over certain charges. Thus, court held the statute did not violate separation of powers doctrine. Court then held that, provided a hearing was held to determine whether to grant leave for appellant to file the charge, respondent's due process rights would not be violated.

A trial court heard the case without a jury and dismissed the case. Respondent appealed to a district court. Appellants moved for a jury trial. The district court denied this request, reasoning that appellants waived their right to a jury trial by failing to request a jury at the trial court level. The district court ruled in favor of respondent and ordered the appellants to pay respondent. Appellants challenged this decision. The appellate court first held that respondent was the proper party to bring the complaint because there was a valid trust agreement between respondent and the hospital which cared for the children. However, the appellate court further held that there was a right to a trial by jury in appeals from lower court proceedings. Therefore, the district court erred in concluding that appellants waived their right to a jury trial.

On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err by refusing to consider sentencing alternatives available to nonviolent felony offenders under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-201(11), because the statutory term &quot;nonviolent felony offender&quot; did not encompass misdemeanor offenders such as defendant. Thus, plaintiff was ineligible for alternative sentencing under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-225. These sentencing statutes did not unconstitutionally deprive misdemeanants of their due process and equal protection rights because the classes &quot;felons&quot; and &quot;misdemeanants&quot; were not similarly situated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile appealed a judgment from the Youth Court and District Court of the Eighth Judicial District, Cascade County (Montana), convicting her of negligent homicide. Defendant urged that she should not have been tried a an adult and that the transfer provisions of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 41-5-206 violated her right to equal protection under the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and the Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial of defendant as an adult and her conviction and sentence for homicide. The findings of fact and conclusions of law in the youth court's transfer order were not in error. There was probable cause to believe that defendant committed the homicide, that treatment was required beyond that afforded by juvenile facilities, and that defendant acted in an aggressive, violent, or premeditated manner. Therefore, the youth court did not abuse its discretion in waiving its jurisdiction. The transfer provisions of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 41-5-206 (statute) did not violate defendant's rights to equal protection under the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and the Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 4. The waiver of jurisdiction was not predicated on the state's inability to find a juvenile system placement but because the duration of and post-release supervision for such a placement would be insufficient. The statute did not require defendant's psychological evaluation without a waiver of her constitutional rights. The issue of whether such a waiver was obtained was not reviewed because it was first raised on appeal. Claims that publicity deprived defendant of a fair trial were unsupported.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the waiver of youth court jurisdiction, defendant's conviction for negligent homicide, and the sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for stalking his wife, who had obtained a temporary restraining order against him. Defendant had telephoned and mailed letters to his wife, and was convicted of violating the protective order, but sent two letters to her from prison. Two unwanted contacts were sufficient to establish the element of repeated contact. There was sufficient evidence to show that defendant's wife suffered substantial emotional distress or reasonable apprehension of bodily injury or death, because the many letters defendant sent her prior to his first conviction had contained threats, and because her relationship with defendant had been tumultuous. The court did not have to decide whether Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-220 was constitutionally void for vagueness or for overbreadth, because the argument was not raised before the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment for the shooting death of his wife. Defendant's first petition for postconviction relief was denied by the trial court, which defendant failed to appeal. Subsequently, the trial court summarily dismissed defendant's second petition on the basis that defendant failed to attach the required affidavits and factual documents and that the ineffective assistance of counsel issues were resolved in the prior proceeding. Thereafter, defendant petitioned for postconviction relief in an original proceeding. The court denied the third petition, holding that it was time barred under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-21-102 (1991) and a successive petition under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-21-105(1) (1995). The court applied the five-year limitations period, which was the statute in effect at the time the petition was filed, rather than the statute in effect at the time of conviction. Further, the miscarriage of justice exception to the limitations period did not apply where defendant failed to allege newly discovered evidence. Thus, the petition, which was filed more than 20 years after defendant's conviction, was time barred.</SPAN></P>

The district court denied his motion to suppress certain evidence and thereafter, defendant pled guilty to the offense of criminal manufacture of dangerous drugs. The remaining charges against him were dismissed. He appealed. The court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part. The court found that the district court did not err in holding that probable cause existed for the issuance of the search warrant on the basis that unproven statements of a child information could not serve as the sole basis for the issuance of a search warrant. The court found that such statements could serve as the basis for the issuance of the search warrant. However, the court remanded the case to the district court to conduct a de novo hearing on defendant's motion to suppress, finding that it would have been inappropriate for the court to review the magistrate's determination that the application for the search warrant established probable cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs challenged the constitutional validity of a state constitutional initiative that prohibited the enactment of a new tax or tax increase unless first approved by a majority of the electors voting on the measure in the geographic area subject to the tax. State voters approved the multi-part initiative. Plaintiffs filed an application for a declaratory judgment and sought a mandatory injunction directing defendants to decertify the election results and a permanent injunction prohibiting defendants from enforcing the provisions. Plaintiffs also sought court costs and attorney fees. Defendants responded that initiative was a valid constitutional amendment and moved to dismiss the claim. The court held the initiative expressly amended three parts of state constitution but did not allow for a separate vote for each amendment. Thus the initiative violated Mont. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held the tax initiative violated the state constitution since the initiative did not allow a separate vote for its amendments and objectionable parts could not be severed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent department applied a two percent phase-in on petitioner's property valuation pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-7-111(1). Petitioner contended the phase-in provision violated Mont. Const. art. III, &sect; 3, which required the equalization of property values and the equal protection and due process laws guaranteed by the United States and Montana constitutions. The trial court agreed with petitioner and held the provision unconstitutional. Upon review, the court found that taxing petitioner at a percentage higher than the market value of his property, while taxing others in the state at less than full market value, was not rationally related to the legitimate state interest in reducing reliance on property taxes and avoiding further property tax increases. The court also held that the provision violated equal protection because it created a class of taxpayers who paid a disproportionate share of property taxes because their taxes were assessed on a basis greater than the market values of their properties. Because the provision did not adjust values over a short period of time and did not attain equality in tax treatment, it was unconstitutional as it applied to petitioner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After following defendant driver for a period of time, a police officer signaled for him to pull over and cited defendant for violation of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-303(1), which required a driver to drive in a careful and prudent manner and at a rate of speed no greater than is reasonable and proper under the conditions existing at the point of operation. Defendant appealed his conviction and contended that the statute was void for vagueness and violated the Due Process Clause, Mont. Const. Art. II, &sect; 17. The reviewing court agreed and reversed his conviction. Defendant had standing to bring the action because his actions did not clearly prohibit the speed restriction of the statute in question. The court found that the statute impermissibly delegated the basic public policy of how fast is too fast on state highways to policemen, judges, and juries for arbitrary and discriminatory resolution. The court held that the statute did not define the crime with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people could understand what conduct was prohibited. Therefore, defendant's conviction was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator, misdemeanor criminal defendant, sought a writ of control surrounding respondent district court's decision that upheld the constitutionality of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-17-201(3). Relator contended that &sect; 46-17-201(3) violated his right to trial by jury pursuant to Mont. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 24 and 26 by only allowing relator to exercise his right to a jury trial once, in either justice court or in district court on trial de novo. The court accepted jurisdiction and held that &sect; 46-17-201(3) was unconstitutional because it impinged upon rights guaranteed under the state constitution. Trial de novo in district court was a different prosecution from one in justice court. Section 46-17-201(3) in effect forced waiver of the right to a jury trial either at the justice court level or at the district court level. Under the state constitution, a defendant had an absolute right not to be convicted of a misdemeanor by less than a unanimous jury. Section 46-17-201(3)&nbsp;unconstitutionally forced a misdemeanor defendant to be convicted by a judge, either in justice court or in a district court, rather than by a unanimous jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, appearing pro se, appealed the bench trial judgment and sentencing order of the Tenth Judicial District Court, Fergus County (Montana), finding him guilty of driving without a valid driver's license under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-5-102, failure to exhibit proof of registration under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-3-322, and failure to exhibit proof of liability insurance under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-6-302.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the primary issues were: (1) whether the district court erred by conducting a bench trial without a written waiver of jury trial; (2) whether defendant was improperly sentenced for a dismissed charge; and (3) whether the motor vehicle codes denied defendant his constitutional freedom to travel or his right to due process of law. Under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 26 and Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-17-201, defendant's oral waiver of jury trial was valid. Defendant's second claim of error had no merit based on the record. Finally, the legislative enactments concerning the motor vehicle codes were presumed constitutional and would be upheld on review except when proven unconstitutional. The right to travel on public highways was not absolute and was subject to reasonable regulations by the state, including regulations on insurance coverage and registration, pursuant to the police power granted by the state constitution and there was no violation of defendant's due process rights under the United States Constitution. Finally, the caption on the sentencing order and judgment was not in any way inadequate because of a slight variation in defendant's middle name.</SPAN></P>

Upon the recommendation of the commission, the applicant brought an action against the city under the Montana Human Rights Act (MHRA), Mont. Code Ann. tit. 49, ch. 2 and the Governmental Code of Fair Practices (GCFP), Mont. Code Ann. tit. 49, ch.3. The trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment and denied that of the applicant, and the applicant sought review. The court affirmed, holding that because the statute applied only to municipal police officers, it was not irreconcilably repugnant to the general prohibitions against age discrimination in the MHRA and the GCFP and thus the statute was not impliedly repealed by the enactment of the MHRA and the GCFP.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children were living with their mother in Arizona. Upon her death, the children were transported to Montana to live with their putative father's relatives, as putative father was incarcerated at the time.

The biological father, who had also been incarcerated for a period of time, appeared in the proceeding to challenge the putative father's claim that it was in the children's best interest that he be granted sole and permanent custody. During the pendency of the proceeding, the putative father died and the trial court permitted the relatives to intervene to seek custody of the children. The trial court subsequently granted permanent custody to the relatives. The court held that (1) the matter was governed by the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act (UMDA), specifically Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 40-4; (2) the relatives did not have standing to intervene under the UMDA because they failed to show that the biological father voluntarily relinquished his right to custody of the children; and (3) the biological father's period of incarceration did not constitute voluntary relinquishment.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed defendant's convictions and remanded for a new trial. The court held that Mont. R. Evid. 803(8), which provided an exception to the hearsay rule for written reports from the Montana state crime laboratory, violated Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 24, and the due process clause guarantees embodied in Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 17. The court held that Mont. R. Evid. 803(8) deprived defendant of an opportunity to cross-exam the lab technician and impermissibly shifted the burden of producing the prosecution's experts to defendant. However, the court held that the prosecution's amendment of the information, which changed the nature of the drug possessed by defendant, was proper because it was an amendment of form only.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff judgment debtor challenged an order from the District Court of the Thirteenth Judicial District (Montana), which granted partial summary judgment to defendants, county and officials, in plaintiff's action alleging violations of his U.S. Const. amend. IV and Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 10 rights. Defendants challenged a partial summary judgment for the judgment debtor finding Montana post-judgment execution statutes unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a writ of execution against the judgment debtor, county officials entered the debtor's residence without his permission and levied upon his personal property, at least some of which was exempt. The judgment debtor filed an action against the county and the officials, alleging, inter alia, that his U.S. Const. amend IV and Mont. Const. art. II, &sect;811 rights were violated. On appeal, the court ruled that the district court erred in determining that the officials' actions did not violate his constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure because the debtor had an expectation of privacy and there were no exigent circumstances. The court then applied the Mathews three-part balancing test to determine that the Montana post-judgment execution statutes were unconstitutional because they did not provide for proper notice and a hearing to a judgment debtor. The court also ruled that the district court properly granted summary judgment as to the debtor's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 actions because the officials were entitled to qualified immunity since it was not clearly established at the time that a writ of execution did not authorize them to enter the debtor's residence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, reversing and remanding as to the partial summary judgment granted to defendants on the judgment creditor's action alleging violations of his constitutional rights to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. The court affirmed as to the findings that Montana post-judgment execution statutes were unconstitutional and that the officials were entitled to qualified immunity.</SPAN></P>

Their motion was deemed denied by operation of law when the district court failed to rule on it within 60 days as provided for by Mont. R. Civ. P. 60(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DEQ brought suit against the individuals under the Motor Vehicle Recycling and Disposal Act, Mont.

The individuals did not respond to any of the DEQ's informal attempts to rectify the situation. The default judgment enjoined the individuals from maintaining or operating a motor vehicle wrecking facility and entered judgment in the amount of $ 68,400. The court held that the standard of review when a trial court refused to set aside a default judgment was whether there has been a slight abuse of discretion. The individuals contended that the default judgment should be set aside pursuant to Mont. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), (6). The individuals maintained that the DEQ misled them into believing that there would not be a default judgment as long as they cooperated with the DEQ in bringing their facility into compliance. The individuals believed that they cooperated with the DEQ. The court held that the individuals did not appear in the action and did not present a meritorious defense to the DEQ's cause of action.</SPAN></P>

The father then assaulted the operator. Another county employee arrived and joined in the fight with defendants until defendants left the scene in their truck. The operator was severely injured in the fight. On appeal, the supreme court found that: (1) the State was not required to prove that pushing the son was part of the operator's official duties, because it is not an element of the charged offense; (2) the State produced sufficient evidence from which a rational jury could find that defendants' actions were motivated by either distaste for the operator's work, or a desire to prevent him from completing his work, or both; and (3) there existed sufficient evidence from which a rational jury could find that defendants injured the operator because of the discharge of his duties or to prevent him from discharging his duties and that defendants were not justified in the use of force against him.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner newspaper and the department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department created a committee to review proposals for the construction of a new prison. The department refused to allow public access to the proposals or committee meetings. The newspaper filed a petition requesting that the committee be restrained from holding private meetings and compelled to disclose all documents associated with its meetings. The trial court allowed private negotiations but required that the committee's deliberations be made public prior to the award of a contract. The court held that Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 9 applied to the committee because it was an agency of the state government and a public body. The proposals submitted by private companies to the committee were documents of a public body that had to be disclosed under art. II, &sect; 9. The court found that the private companies did not have an actual expectation that all information in the proposals would be kept confidential; only trade secrets and matters related to security would not ultimately be made public. As the committee meetings were only closed for economic advantage, there was no legitimate reason to preclude public disclosure.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-416(1) and refused to pay the benefits that the employee's impairment rating required. The insurer contended that the 30 percent reduction did not affect the employee's third-party recovery and that the statute merely effected the employee's entitlement to benefits. The court affirmed the judgment finding Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-416(1)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The court held &sect; 39-71-416(1) facially ignored the employee's right to full legal redress under Mont. Const. art.

When he refused to submit to a preliminary alcohol screening test (PAST), his driver's license was suspended. The driver sought review of his license suspension on grounds that the PAST statute,&nbsp;Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-409, and the implied consent statute,&nbsp;Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-403 (1995), were vague because they contained irreconcilable hearing provisions. The trial court held that there was no conflict, and the court affirmed. The court held that inasmuch as the issues which could be considered at a hearing under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-403(4) (1995) differed from the provisions of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-409(6) (1995), under the rule that the specific prevailed over the general, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-409(6) (1995), the specific statute on PASTs, specified the issues which could be discussed at a hearing on suspension of a driver's license when the suspension was based upon refusal to submit to a PAST prior to arrest. Thus the driver did not establish a conflict among Montana's implied consent statutes which rendered them unconstitutionally vague either on their face or as applied to him.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer brought a motion to dismiss the action and to remove the matter to federal court. After a hearing, the district court denied the motions and ordered the taxpayer to file the returns. The taxpayer appealed. The court affirmed because the taxpayer failed to provide any authority for removal to federal court. In addition, the tax returns sought were required by Montana law, and the taxpayer failed to assert with any support that he was either denied an adequate remedy in the state court, or that his contentions were more appropriately a matter for federal court. Accordingly, there was no basis to remove the matter to federal court, and the district court did not err when it denied the removal motion. The court also held that the motion to dismiss was properly denied because the mere fact that the taxpayer received money as income triggered the obligation to file a state income tax return.</SPAN></P>

The inmate contended that this was unconstitutional on the grounds that respondent state failed to appoint counsel to represent him in his sentence review. The inmate requested the reinstatement of his original sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate pled guilty to and was convicted in three separate criminal prosecutions of criminal mischief, burglary and misdemeanor theft, and theft. The inmate applied for sentence review and subsequently appeared at a hearing before the review division. The inmate, who had previously been determined indigent, did not have the assistance of counsel. Subsequently the inmate's sentences were increased. The court reasoned that the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 24 guaranteed a criminal defendant the right to counsel in criminal proceedings. Further, the court held that this right to counsel arose at every critical stage of the proceedings against him. The court concluded that sentence review was a critical stage of the proceedings against a defendant. The court reasoned that like the original sentencing itself, the potential substantial prejudice at the sentence review was not only present, but was enormous. Therefore, the court held that the inmate was denied his constitutional right to counsel during the sentence review procedure, and that as a result he suffered substantial prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the inmate's request and reinstated his original sentences. However, the court did so in the context of an extraordinary writ as opposed to granting post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court judge ordered defendant to serve 10 years in state prison and denied him parole until phase I and II of a sexual offender program was completed.

One year later, the nunc pro tunc order was entered that conformed to the actual judgment intended. Defendant was advised he was ineligible for his parole hearing that was scheduled and was unaware until then of the nun pro tunc order. Defendant filed a late appeal, which was allowed although untimely. Defendant contended that the nunc pro tunc order erroneously modified his sentence and violated his rights. The court, in affirming defendant's sentence, held that the oral pronouncement of sentence was the legally effective sentence and that his Sixth Amendment right was not violated because he was present at sentencing and had the opportunity to respond before sentence was imposed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town enacted an ordinance requiring the installation of water meters at the direction of the Montana Public Service Commission, in conjunction with the application for grants and loans to improve the water system.

The trial court ruled in the town's favor and the court affirmed. The court held that, under the constitution, the taxpayers retained the powers of initiative and referendum as to legislative acts only, but that the ordinance was an administrative act. The court, applying newly adopted guidelines for determining whether an action was administrative or legislative, found that the ordinance was administrative because the water meter decision was a small segment of an overall policy, the best method of water use billing entailed decision-making functions involving specialized knowledge and experience, and the existence of previous public hearings and coterminous objections confirmed that the issue had not been addressed for the first time when the ordinance was adopted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with sexual intercourse without consent, aggravated kidnapping, and assault. The jury found him guilty of kidnapping, a lesser included offense of aggravated kidnapping. After the jury's verdict the district court, on its own initiative, notified the parties of its intent to order a new trial. Although neither party had made a motion for a new trial, the district court ordered a new trial sua sponte. The State contended that the district court erred in granting a new trial, sua sponte, because under the plain language of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-16-702, the district court had no authority to do so. The court rejected this contention, holding that under &sect; 46-16-702, the district court had authority to order a new trial sua sponte. The court reasoned that the statute did not specifically withhold the power of the trial court to grant a new trial sua sponte. Further, the court held that its attention had not been called to, nor had its research revealed, any authority, constitutional, statutory, or judicial decision, which usurped the inherent power of the trial court to set aside a verdict and order a new trial, sua sponte, in the interest of justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original proceeding, defendant petitioned for a writ of injunction pursuant to Mont.

Defendant claimed that hanging was cruel and unusual punishment and that the amendment to &sect; 46-19-103, which provided that all death sentences were imposed by lethal injection, constituted an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, sentenced to death, elected under &sect; 46-19-103 to die by hanging. During his post-conviction actions, &sect; 46-19-103 was amended to eliminate hanging as a means of execution. Defendant brought an original proceeding in the court for a writ of injunction to enjoin the state from executing him. He argued that the amended statute truncated his ability to appeal his death sentence and nullified his claim that hanging was cruel and unusual punishment. He also claimed that &sect; 46-19-103 was an ex post facto law. The court denied his petition for a writ, holding that an ex post facto law deprived a defendant of a defense. Section 46-19-103 came into play after sentence was imposed and addressed only the procedure by which the sentence was carried out. Changes in the procedures did not affect substantial rights in a way that implicated the prohibition against ex post facto laws. The court also ruled that defendant's purely conjectural assertions that he had a due process right to avoid execution under the earlier version of &sect; 46-19-103 did not create a current substantive right which was infringed by an amendment altering only the procedure by which his sentence was carried out.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal from the Eighteenth, Twelfth, and Thirteenth Judicial District Courts (Montana), the court considered the challenges of appellant juveniles to the constitutionality of the Extended Jurisdiction Prosecution Act, Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-5-1601 to -1607, under the Equal Protection, Due Process and Double Jeopardy Clauses of the federal and state constitutions and under Mont. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal by appellant juvenile offenders, appellants contended that the Extended Jurisdiction Prosecution Act (EJPA), which was applied in each of appellant's cases, violated the Equal Protection, Double Jeopardy, and Due Process clauses of the Montana and United States Constitutions by subjecting them to a longer period of incarceration than that permitted for an adult offender. The court first determined that appellants had standing to challenge the EJPA because of the threat of injury by its imposition. The court then held that the EJPA, on its face, violated appellants' equal protection rights by treating them more harshly than their adult counterparts. The EJPA also violated the Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 15 by reducing, rather than enhancing, appellants' rights as compared to an adult's rights because if a juvenile violated the terms of the juvenile disposition, it was possible the juvenile would serve a longer term of detention or imprisonment than an adult who had committed the same offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Having found that the Extended Juvenile Prosecution Act (EJPA) violated the equal protection rights of appellant juvenile offenders because it treated them more harshly than their adult counterparts, the court affirmed the district court decisions that also found the EJPA unconstitutional and remanded the remaining cases to their respective district courts for proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, state and child support enforcement agency (CSED), sought review of an order of the District Court, County of Missoula (Montana) that dismissed the CSED's income withholding action against respondent father as the result of his failure to comply with his child support obligations, after granting the father's petition to amend its prior opinion and order on judicial review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A father failed to pay child support obligations ordered pursuant to a divorce decree. The mother applied for public assistance and assigned her right to enforce the support order to CSED. The CSED initiated, but did not conclude, collection efforts. The mother thereafter agreed to waive the support arrearages. The CSED then initiated a wage withholding action and an administrative law judge (ALJ) held that the suit could continue because the CSED was not party to the waiver. On judicial review, the trial court reversed the ALJ's decision and dismissed the withholding action. The CSED appealed. The court reversed the trial court judgment. The court held that the CSED's attempts to collect were not one continuous action, therefore the delay between first collection action and the second withholding action was irrelevant. The court found that the father was not denied due process when he was denied a hearing in the first collection action because that action was discontinued. The court concluded that the CSED's second action did not violate Mont. Const. at. II, &sect; 16 because both actions were resolved promptly, one by discontinuance and the other via hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded the matter with instructions that the trial court reinstate its original ruling that the waiver of child support arrearages was void, and remanded the case to the CSED for a determination of the past-due amount owed by the father.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Montana legislature modified its real property appraisal system and enacted a new one. Thereafter, the taxpayers paid their real property taxes for four tax years under the new system. The Montana Supreme Court, in the meantime, issued a decision that declared the new tax appraisal system unconstitutional. The legislature attempted to fix the defects, but the state supreme court held the new legislation did not rid the new tax appraisal system of the constitutional defects previously identified. The taxpayers filed their declaratory judgment action approximately three years after the last court decision on the issue and claimed that, because they paid real property taxes based on an unconstitutional method of assessment, they were entitled to relief. After the trial court granted the tax collectors' motion to dismiss, the state supreme court found the taxpayers' were not entitled to relief. It so concluded, because it found either their claims were barred by the 90-day limitations period for bringing a declaratory judgment action found in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-406(2) or were insufficient as a matter of law, such as the tax payments not having been paid under protest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the District Court of the Eighth Judicial District, In and for the County of Cascade (Montana) of three counts of felony theft. Defendant filed a petition for postconviction relief, asserting that his constitutional rights had been violated and that newly discovered evidence entitled him to a new trial or an evidentiary hearing. The trial court dismissed the petition, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred in concluding that his rights under Brady v. Maryland were not violated, that the trial court abused its discretion in determining that he was not entitled to a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, and that he was entitled to a new trial as a matter of due process, based on newly discovered evidence. The court held that the trial court correctly concluded that defendant's due process Brady rights were not violated. Defendant's unsupported allegation, made on information and belief, did not establish good cause for permission to conduct discovery as required by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-21-201(3) (1993), nor was it sufficient to entitle him to an evidentiary hearing under &sect; 46-21-201(1). The court further held that the newly discovered evidence was not related to the theft charge at issue, was not probative of defendant's innocence, would not probably have produced a different result upon retrial, and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. The court also held that defendant was not entitled to a new trial as a matter of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lottery winners were Montana residents when they won a multi-state lottery game in 1991. In 1992 they moved to the state of Washington and did not report their 1992 lottery payment as Montana income because they received it after they moved to Washington. The lower court held that the lottery proceeds were income earned in Montana within the meaning of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-30-105 and were subject to Montana's state income tax. The lottery winners contended that a 1991 version of the statutes in question applied and that the winnings were exempt from state income tax. The court concluded that the statutes in effect at the time of each annual lottery payment controlled as to taxation of that payment. The court held that the lottery winners' 1992 and subsequent lottery payments were not excluded from income under Mont.

The court held that the trial court's findings and conclusions regarding appellants' interest in the road was supported by sufficient evidence. The court further held that the trial court properly awarded respondents costs pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 25-10-20. The court, however, held that the trial court erroneously relied on equitable principles in awarding attorney fees to respondents. The court also held that because no exception to the general rule prohibiting attorney fees awards absent a contractual or statutory basis was presented, respondents were not entitled to the award.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner prisoner filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus after the Twentieth Judicial District Court, Lake County (Montana), denied his motion to continue bond pending appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was convicted of negligent homicide, criminal endangerment, and criminal trespass to property as a result of a fatal traffic accident. He had consumed alcohol prior to the incident. The district court denied the prisoner's motion to continue bond pending appeal. The prisoner then filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus. The court denied his petition. Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-9-107 provided that a convicted criminal defendant was not entitled to bail pending appeal unless the district court found that he or she was not likely to either flee or pose a danger. The court found that none of the district court's findings in that regard were unsupported by the record. While the district court could have given additional weight to the findings of the clinicians that had recently treated the prisoner for alcohol dependency and bipolar affective disorder, its failure to do so was not an abuse of its discretion. Moreover, prior to trial, the prisoner had repeatedly violated the bond condition that he not consume alcohol. The court also ruled that the prisoner was not entitled to bond under &sect; 46-9-107 simply because his convictions could be reversed on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged that &sect; 45-5-221(1)(c), was void for vagueness, over broad as applied to him, and in violation of his constitutional rights. On appeal, the court held that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-221 did not violate defendant's right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment or Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 7 because defendant coupled his message on the bumper stickers with defacement of property. Further, free speech did not give defendant the right to embarrass, annoy or harass, causing substantial emotional distress. Mont.

After an initial trial in the city court for reckless driving and two counts of assault, defendant received a trial de novo in the district court. The child was unavailable to testify in the district court, and a municipal court judge was allowed to testify to her recollection of the testimony the child gave at the earlier trial. Defendant's common-law wife testified that at no time was she afraid of defendant during the entire incident. The court reversed defendant's conviction on two counts of assault. The testimony of the municipal court judge was inadmissible hearsay because a transcript or some other recording device, which accurately presented a verbatim record of the earlier testimony, did not offer it.

Because counsel abandoned the appeal, the court held that all claims foreclosed from appeal because of that abandonment could be raised in a post-conviction petition. Counsel's trial tactics and strategic decisions deserved great deference. In order to constitute ineffective assistance, acts of counsel had to stem from neglect or ignorance rather than from informed, professional deliberation. Counsel's advice as to the offense and the plea were obligatory, not strategic, decisions, and deference was given to those decisions. Withdrawal of guilty pleas was permitted under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-16-105(2). Counsel's acquiescence in the dissemination of the mental health reports pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-14-202 was not deficient. Counsel had a duty to inform defendant of the consequences of participation in the mental health evaluation. However, defendant was not harmed by the alleged failure to inform.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's post-conviction relief except to allow further amendment of the petition in order to more fully address sentencing issues. The court also denied claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the trial and found the guilty pleas to be knowing and voluntary. The court held that defendant was prejudiced by counsel's abandonment of the appeal.</SPAN></P>

At the hospital, a routine blood test revealed a blood alcohol content of .109. Another officer requested another blood sample. Defendant was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-401. Her motion to suppress the blood test results was denied and she was convicted. The court reversed. The court noted that neither officer had personal knowledge of defendant's alcohol consumption or received information from a reliable source. Because there was no probable cause, the test ordered by the officer was an unlawful search and seizure. The facts establishing probable cause for an investigative subpoena seeking the results of the routine test were the results of the illegally obtained test and a statement that blood had been taken at the hospital. The court held that the illegally obtained test could not provide probable cause. Because there was no indication that the unnamed source was reliable, that statement also did not establish probable cause.

On appeal, defendant argued that the district court erred when it denied his motion to dismiss the felony DUI charge against him. Although defendant pled guilty to the offense of DUI, he contended that the district court should not have considered his prior DUI convictions because the court records of those convictions did not affirmatively establish that he voluntarily waived his right to counsel in the prior proceedings. Defendant also asserted that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-714(4) was, on its face, unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the district court did not err when it denied the motion to dismiss because defendant failed to present any direct evidence to establish that his constitutional rights were violated in any of the prior proceedings. In addition, the court held that defendant could not challenge the statute as void for vagueness because the statute was reasonably clear in its application to defendant's conduct.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found that the 1987 law provided that temporary caps expired on a date certain and therefore any awards after that time were not subject to the caps and that the law in place at the time of the injury was the law that prevailed. The court held further that any ambiguities as to the settlement agreements were to be construed against the drafters.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court authorized the update of a decree of water rights from 1902 because of the physical deterioration of the original decree. The owners were not given notice of the action to update the decree. The updated decree included the ownership, priority dates, flow rates, place of use, and ditch used for each water right. The owners were involved in an overclaim dispute in the Montana Water Court. Upon review, the court found that the updated decree adjudicated water rights and exceeded the jurisdiction of the district court. It was solely in the province of the water court to determine priority dates, flow rates, place of use, and means of diversions of the water rights under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 85-2-234(6). The updated decree reallocated and adjudicated water rights that did not previously exist under the original 1902 decree. The substance of the decree itself was invalid because the district court exceeded its jurisdiction, and thus, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 85-5-301 afforded no remedy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee appealed from the judgment of the Workers' Compensation Court (Montana) that dismissed his petition for a declaratory judgment against defendant Uninsured Employers' Fund (UEF). The lower court concluded that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-501 (1991), as applied to the employee, did not deny the employee equal protection of the laws or access to the courts in violation of the Montana Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee injured his eye while employed by a tribe member under a logging contract with a tribally owned business. The employer did not carry workers' compensation insurance. A tribal court determined that the logging contract did not require the employer to carry workers' compensation insurance and that the Workers' Compensation Act (act) did not apply to tribe-owned businesses conducted exclusively with the boundaries of the reservation. The UEF then denied the employee's claim because the employer was not an &quot;uninsured employer&quot; as defined by &sect; 39-71-501 and he could not therefore be required to carry workers' compensation insurance under the (act). The court held that the lower court did not err. The court reasoned that the exclusion of tribe business employees from UEF coverage via &sect; 39-71-501 was rationally related to the legitimate government purpose of providing &quot;substitute&quot; benefits to employees of employers subject to but failing to comply with the act. The court also reasoned that no authority required guaranteed access to state courts for an injury where federal law prohibiting the exercise of state jurisdiction over the claim precluded such access.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the decision affirming the UEF's denial of compensation benefits to the employee because the statute that excluded the employer from the scope of the act did not deny the employee equal protection or access to the courts. No statute prevented the employee from pursuing non-act claims against the employer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee challenged the lower court's denial of his motion for summary judgment on the issue of whether he was constitutionally entitled to change his treating physician without the prior approval of the state compensation insurance fund. The court concluded that the lower court erred in denying the employee's motion for summary judgment because it violated the employee's equal protection of the laws. The court held that when the state made the payment of treatment costs contingent on its approval of the treating physician, it effectively removed the injured claimant's right to freely choose the physician of his or her choice. The court rejected the state's citation to the cost control achieved by limiting physician choice as the sole rational basis justifying the policy requiring physician preapproval. The court concluded that cost-control alone did not justify disparate treatment which violated an individual's right to equal protection of the law. The court concluded that the precise effect of the rule was to reduce costs by depriving a certain class of persons of benefits they would otherwise receive.</SPAN></P>

The actions of the railroad workers were consolidated on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In railroad workers' actions against railroad companies brought in the eighth and second districts under the FELA, the railroad companies filed motions for a change of venue pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 25-2-122(2), a statute that allowed for a change of venue for tort victims injured by individuals or unincorporated non-resident tortfeasors but not for tort victims injured by non-resident corporations. The eighth district granted the motions and the second district denied the motions. In a consolidated appeal, the railroad workers challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 25-2-122(2). The court remanded the cases holding that &sect; 25-2-122(2) was unconstitutional. The court held that the classification used in the statute did not warrant review under strict scrutiny because there was no compelling state interest, and did not warrant review under middle-tier scrutiny because the state's interest in the classification was no greater than that of the interests of the railroad workers, and applied the rational basis test. The court concluded that the objective of &sect; 25-2-122(2) bore no rational relation to the statute's classification and therefore violated the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 27-1-703(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was struck by a motor home near a housing complex that was owned and operated by the authority, in which he was a tenant. He filed a complaint against the authority, the driver of the motor home, the State of Montana, and the Butte-Silver Bow County and settled with the driver and the state. The county's motion for summary judgment was granted. The child filed an amended complaint against the authority. Its answer did not include a specific nonparty defense and it did not amend its pleadings to allege such a defense by the discovery deadline. The district court, in a pretrial order, allowed the authority to assert a nonparty defense pursuant to Mont. Code. Ann. &sect; 27-1-703(6). The child petitioned the court to reverse that portion of the district court's order allowing the authority to assert a nonparty defense. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that &sect; 27-1-703(6) was unconstitutional pursuant to the Montana Constitution as it allowed apportionment of liability to parties, in this case the child's parents, who were not named in the action and who did not have an opportunity to appear and defend themselves.</SPAN></P>

Respondents also directed that no evidentiary material could be filed with the trial court unless it was under seal (filing order). Relator newspaper filed an application for a writ of supervisory control to correct the orders. The court granted the writ.

The court held that the consent of the parties was irrelevant given the media's right to be heard concerning the issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Through the use of a thermal imager, a police investigator determined that defendants' shed was discharging an amount of heat, which was consistent with the cultivation of marijuana plants.

The trial court denied defendants' motion to suppress the fruits of the search.

The court reversed the trial court's ruling on the motion to suppress and held that the warrantless use of a thermal imager was an unconstitutional search.

Plaintiff city filed suit against the district to recover water charges that the district refused to pay. The district sought to enjoin the city from enforcing a rate increase, pending the outcome of the litigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the parties entered into a contract for the sale of water, the city's water rates were regulated by another entity. Later, the legislature adopted Mont. Code Ann. 69-7-101 (1981), which allowed the city to regulate its own rates. When the city raised the district's rates more than the contract allowed, the district refused to pay. On appeal, the court reversed because the district court abused its discretion. The court found that the district had shown a violation of the contract clauses of the state and federal constitutions, Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 31, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court used a three-part test to analyze the contract clause challenge. It found that the city's use of the statute to raise rates violated the contract clause because the city's reason, to raise revenue for the city, was unrelated to the purpose for which the statute was adopted, which was to simplify the regulatory process. Further, the district showed that it's injury could not be remedied by a monetary damage award after a trial on the merits. Because the district met the requirements of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-19-201(3) it was entitled to a preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant revenue department appealed the summary judgments of the District Court of the Eighth Judicial District, Cascade County (Montana) in favor plaintiff taxpayers. The district court found that the use of more than one valuation approach violated Mont. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3 and Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-7-112 and that certain assessments were not enforceable because of a violation of the deadline in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-8-201.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that Montana law required the revaluation of all property and that the revenue department set up a valuation system using the cost approach, the market data approach, the income approach, or a combination of the approaches depending on the property. The taxpayers contested the revaluation. The court reversed the summary judgments. In examining the statutory scheme and legislative history, the court concluded that the &quot;same method of appraisal&quot; in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-7-112 did not require the use of a single approach, but referred to a consistent process for determining market value using multiple approaches. The court found that the intent of Mont. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3 was also not to limit valuation to a single approach and that the revenue department's methodology was a reasonable attempt to equalize the appraisal of real property in the state. The court concluded that the assessment notices sent after the deadline in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-8-201 were not unenforceable because only the assessment had to be completed before the deadline, and there was no substantive effect of the taxpayers' ability to appeal the valuations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with several offenses after he caused a head-on collision. He pleaded guilty to driving with a suspended or revoked license, failing to have insurance, and failing to use a seatbelt. Defendant appealed after the District Court of the Twenty-First Judicial District, in and for the County of Ravalli (Montana), convicted him of criminal endangerment in violation of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-207(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pulled out of a parking lot and headed into oncoming traffic. He failed a field sobriety test; his driver's license had previously been revoked. Defendant pleaded guilty on three related counts and was tried on charges of criminal endangerment and driving under the influence. Defendant unsuccessfully moved for an acquittal on the criminal endangerment charge, claiming that the State had failed to prove that he had &quot;knowingly&quot; created a substantial risk of injury to another. Defendant appealed, asserting that the trial court had erred in instructing the jury that, to be convicted, defendant needed only to be aware of his conduct and did not need to be aware of the probable result of his conduct. In reversing, the court held that the trial court had erred in interpreting the scienter requirement for &sect; 45-5-207(1) and, in doing so, had impermissibly altered the State's burden of proof in violation of Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 17. It was not enough to prove that defendant had intended to engage in conduct, but rather, pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-2-101(34) (1995), the State had to prove that defendant was aware of the high probability of the risks posed by his conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause with direction to reconsider defendant's motion for acquittal. It ordered that, if the trial court denied the motion for acquittal, it should grant defendant's motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the District Court of the Eleventh Judicial District, Flathead County (Montana), which imposed four death penalties.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated kidnapping and deliberate homicides, and was sentenced to death.

The court affirmed the trial court's imposition of the death penalty, finding that the trial court's findings concerning aggravating and mitigating circumstance were supported by the evidence. The court also concluded that it was not its role to reweigh the evidence and that the trial court applied the proper standard in weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court for the District of Montana, Billings Division (Montana) sought review by certified question of the meaning of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-1-703 (1995) in a case instituted by plaintiff employee against defendants, contractor and United States, for work related injuries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for a subcontractor at the construction site of the contractor who was hired by the United States to work on a dam. The employee was injured on the job and received workers' compensation benefits through his employer. Thereafter, the employee instituted an action against the United States. The United States filed a third-party complaint against the contractor. The employee then filed an amended complaint against the contractor. Both defendants then were granted leave to file amended answers asserting that the injuries were caused by the employer's negligence. The federal trial court certified two questions for review in light of changes made by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-1-703(4) (1995). On review, the court held that as the immune employer and co-employee could have been neither apportioned liability or negligence as non-parties, nor named, sued, and thereby, apportioned liability or negligence as parties, there was no way in which the injured worker's third-party recovery could have been reduced as a result of any conduct by the employer or co-employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the injured employee's third-party recovery could not be reduced by the actions of the employer or the co-employee. The court also held that the second certified question was moot and that it was unnecessary to reach the constitutional issue in the first question.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was arrested for DUI, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-714(6) (1995) was enacted. Section 61-8-714(6) allowed the state to consider all previous DUI convictions in imposing a felony sanction upon a repeat DUI offender. The previous statute permitted the consideration of only those DUIs convictions less than five years old. Defendant was charged with DUI. He filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the state's application of &sect; 61-8-714(6) to his case violated his constitutional right not to be subjected to ex post facto laws. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant entered a plea of guilty. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's order and remanded the case to the trial court. The court held that &sect; 61-8-714(6) did not violate the ex post facto clauses of the federal or Montana Constitutions because defendant was on notice that his prior DUI convictions would be considered in a subsequent DUI conviction, so the legal consequences of defendant's offense had not changed. The court ruled, however, that the trial court erred in considering defendant's nine-year-old DUI conviction because the offense had been expunged pursuant to the previous statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In death penalty case, petitioner challenged a decision by the Sixteenth Judicial District, County of Custer court (Montana), which denied the his amended petition for postconviction relief pursuant to Mont.

The district court ruled that most of the claims presented by the petitioner on appeal were barred by the doctrine of res judicata.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue in the petitioner's appeal was whether the petitioner presented issues for postconviction relief review that could have been presented earlier on appeal. The court found that whether one person lived and another died for conduct alleged to have occurred during the same transaction should not have hinged on a district court's discretionary denial of a motion to amend a petition for postconviction relief. The court found that the district court's denial was particularly unreasonable in light of Mont. R. Civ. P. 15(a)'s admonition that leave was to be freely given when justice so required. The motion to amend was filed by the date the district court had established for the amendment and no prejudice to the state was established which would justify its denial. The court further found that pursuant to the individualized treatment required by statute,&nbsp;Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-310, and rules of proportionality, the propriety of a death sentence had to have been evaluated based on the conduct of the defendant and not by attributing to him the conduct of some other person which he neither participated in nor approved.</SPAN></P>

The court found that while apportioning liability for damages was a legitimate governmental objective, the 1995 amendments to Mon.

On appeal, the court reversed his weapon and drug convictions. The court found that the objective data that the police officer observed about defendant was that he entered and left a convenience store at late at night, used the telephone, moved around the convenience store, put his hands in his pockets, and stared at the police officer. The court ruled that defendant's actions did not support a particularized suspicion that defendant was, or had been, engaged in criminal activity. Thus, the court held that under the totality of the circumstances, the record was insufficient to support a finding that the police officer had a particularized suspicion that defendant was engaged in criminal activity; therefore, the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress was clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's convictions for criminal possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia, and for carrying a concealed weapon.</SPAN></P>

After a lunch break following opening statements, one of the jurors advised the court that she was ill and would not be returning to jury duty. No alternate juror was available. On review, the court held that defendant was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the question of manifest necessity and that a mistrial declared at his request and for reasons not attributable to judicial or prosecutorial overreaching was not a barrier to reprosecution. The court found that jeopardy had attached in the first trial because the jury was empaneled and sworn. The court then overruled precedent, and held that review of a double jeopardy issue must occur before the second trial. The court reasoned that once defendant endured the second trial, regardless of conviction or acquittal, he had incurred the risk; he had been put in &quot;jeopardy,&quot; and that fact could not be remedied or expunged after the fact. The court then found that there was no requirement that manifest necessity for the mistrial of the first trial be shown because that standard only applied where the mistrial had been declared without the defendant's request or consent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the criminal defamation statute,&nbsp;Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-8-212(2), was unconstitutionally overbroad and violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 7 because on its face the statute prohibited truthful criticism when not communicated for good motives and justifiable ends. The court held that the stalking statute,&nbsp;Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-220(1)(b), was not facially defective because it specifically did not apply to constitutionally protected activities such as truthful communications, pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-220(2). The burden was on defendant to prove that his activity was constitutionally protected. Truth was not an absolute defense to a charge of stalking, which focused on conduct which might, but did not necessarily, involve speech. If defendant's fliers contained truthful information and were otherwise lawfully posted, then the act of posting the fliers may have been a constitutionally protected activity, which then required a determination of whether the statement was an element of conduct which was harassing, intimidating or threatening within the purview of the stalking statute.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and awarded custody to the father. A natural parent had a constitutional right to parent his or her child. A finding of abuse, neglect, or dependency was the jurisdictional prerequisite for any court-ordered transfer of custody from a natural parent to a third party. When a surviving parent did not voluntarily relinquish custody, the best interest of the child test could be used only after a showing of dependency or abuse and neglect by the natural parent. The district court erred in awarding custody of the child to the stepfather based on the best interest of the child test in view of the fact there were no allegations of abuse and neglect or dependency on the part of the father. The district court was informed of both parties' financial resources and it did not abuse its discretion in directing the parties to pay their own attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant admitted to past criminal acts at a treatment facility, which he was required to do by court order, he was charged with rape and sexual assault. He moved to dismiss the charges, alleging that the state violated his constitutionally guaranteed privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Defendant's motion was denied, and he pled guilty. Defendant appealed. The state supreme court found that the policies of the treatment program required that defendant fully and honestly disclose his offense history. If he failed to do so, his probation would have been revoked and he would been sent to prison. It was therefore undisputed that the state compelled defendant to divulge past activities that it knew would be criminal. The information divulged by defendant was self-incriminatory. On the basis of the offense history disclosed, defendant was charged and convicted of additional crimes. Accordingly, defendant's motion to dismiss should have been granted because the state improperly compelled him to disclose past criminal acts in violation of his Fifth Amendment privileges against self incrimination and his constitutionally guaranteed right to remain silent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was originally charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). When it was discovered that defendant had seven prior DUI convictions and a conviction for negligent homicide, the charge was changed to criminal endangerment. Following his conviction, defendant argued on appeal that he was incorrectly charged under the criminal endangerment statute rather than under more specific DUI statutes. The court held that, when there was no clear and manifest legislative intent to the contrary and different proof was required under two alternative statutes, it was not necessary that the most specific statutory violation be charged. The crime to be charged was a matter of prosecutorial discretion. The court concluded that the facts supported a charge of criminal endangerment. Defendant also argued that the statute was vague as applied to him. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment. The court noted that, with his history of DUI convictions and negligent homicide, defendant should reasonably have understood that his drunk driving created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury to others and was therefore proscribed.</SPAN></P>

In signing the plea agreement, he acknowledged that he could be sentenced to serve from 10 to 100 years in prison. Defendant contended that the district court erred because the written judgment was inconsistent with the prior oral pronouncement of his sentence. The district court orally sentenced him to a period of 40 years with the first 10 years to be served in prison. The written judgment sentenced him to 40 years and recommended that he serve a portion of his sentence in prison. At the sentencing hearing, he presented evidence that he argued supported a sentence of less than the mandatory minimum of 10 years under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-222 (1993). Upon review, the court found that defendant was not prejudiced because while the district court incorrectly varied its written judgment from its oral pronouncement of sentence, the error was harmless because the written judgment was more lenient than the oral pronouncement. The exceptions of &sect; 46-18-222 did not apply because defendant received more than the statutory minimum sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee appealed the order of the District Court of the Nineteenth Judicial District, Lincoln County (Montana), which granted a motion to dismiss the action that was filed by defendants, county, county commissioners, and county sheriff. The trial court held that the action was time-barred, that the Workers' Compensation Act (WCA) provided an exclusive remedy, and that the Montana Safety Act did not apply to the police officer's claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was a deputy who suffered severe emotional trauma after he unsuccessfully tried to save a teenage suicide victim. The employee's workers' compensation claim was denied. The employee filed the instant action without first filing a notice of claim with the county clerk within the limitations period. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision. The court held that although filing a notice of state tort claims pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-9-301(2) was a prerequisite to filing an action, no prior filing was necessary under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-9-301(3) for an action against a political subdivision. Thus, the complaint was not time-barred. The court held that because an employee with &quot;mental-mental&quot; injuries did not suffer an injury as defined in the WCA, the WCA did not afford him any &quot;remedy.&quot; Thus, in keeping with the quid pro quo nature of the WCA, the employee was allowed to proceed in tort against defendants. The court also found that the Montana Safety Act applied to mental as well as physical injuries and, thus, there was a factual issue as to whether defendants breached their duty in failing to train, supervise, treat, or debrief the employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court, which had dismissed the employee's tort action for mental injuries suffered on the job. The court remanded the action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued, inter alia, that the employee's action was barred by res judicata and that he had no constitutional right to employment.

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the employee's wrongful termination was not barred by res judicata because his petition for judicial review of an agency decision that validated Rule 81-2 was a distinct and separate proceeding. The court also held that the right to the opportunity to pursue employment was a fundamental right under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 3 because it was a right without which other constitutionally guaranteed rights would have little meaning. The court applied strict scrutiny analysis and found that Rule 81-2 infringed upon the employee's right to the opportunity to pursue employment outside of his government employment. The court concluded that the employee's termination was wrongful because the State failed to demonstrate a compelling interest for the infringement by Rule 81-2 and retaliated against him for refusing to violate policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant owned a muffler shop. The land upon which he operated his business was reserved on an original plat of the city by a railroad. On the plat, the land was designated as &quot;reserved for railroad purposes.&quot; The city filed a complaint against defendant for failure to obtain a business license in violation of &sect; 5-1-2 of the city of Forsyth Codes. The district court denied defendant's subsequent motion to dismiss and found the reserved land to be within the city limits. Defendant appealed and the trial was held in his absence. Defendant was found guilty and appealed. In affirming, the court agreed with the district court that the areas marked &quot;reserved for railroad uses&quot; merely kept the reserved property from being platted and therefore defendant was subject to the city's business licensing ordinance. The court found that the constitutionality of the city's licensing requirement was never properly before the district court and the court would not render an opinion. Defendant failed to establish the threshold requirement of prejudicial error under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-20-701 regarding his objection to testimony admitted at the trial.</SPAN></P>

She also sought injunctive relief and a refund of taxes paid. The trial court granted the Department's motion for summary judgment, holding that the retailer was without standing to contest to constitutionality of the statute. Upon review the court affirmed, holding that under &sect; 15-70-204, the retailer was not burdened with the tax. The court held that thus the legal incidence of the tax did not fall on the retailer.

The court disagreed and affirmed his conviction. The court held that &sect; 45-5-220 was not unconstitutionally vague because the legislature was not required to define every term it employed when constructing a statute. The court held that if a term was one of common usage and readily understood, it would be presumed that a reasonable person of average intelligence comprehended it, and that words such as &quot;repeatedly,&quot; &quot;harassing,&quot; and &quot;intimidating&quot; had commonly understood meanings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute, 1989 Mont. Laws 664, &sect; 3, amended by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 19-5-502, increased pension benefits for judges who served more than 15 years. The amendment provided that it took effect two years after its enactment. The judge, who had served for 29 years, retired after the amendment was enacted but before it took effect. The board denied the judge's petition for a redetermination of his pension benefits. Upon the judge's certified question to the court, the court determined that the amendment did not apply to judges who retired after the enactment date but prior to the effective date. Therefore, the court held that the judge was not entitled to increased pension benefits pursuant to 1989 Mont. Laws 664, &sect; 3. The court held that &sect; 3 did not violate the Contracts Clause of the Constitution because pension benefits were to be determined by the latest enactments in effect prior to a recipient's actual retirement. The court ruled that &sect; 3 was not unreasonably or arbitrary in violation of the equal protection clause because it was rationally related to the legitimate governmental interest of providing an incentive for judges to remain in service for a longer period of time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in the District Court for the Eleventh Judicial District in Flathead County (Montana) with deliberate homicide, in violation of Mont.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it instructed the jury that it was not necessary for the State to prove that defendant intended to cause the death of the victim. Finding that the instruction was error, though harmless, the court affirmed the conviction. The instruction provided that it would be sufficient to convict defendant if the act, which caused the harm, was done purposely without regard to whether any harm was intended. The court held that deliberate homicide was committed when a person purposely or knowingly caused the death of another human being. A person acted knowingly when there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that he was aware of the high probability of the result of his conduct. Finally, there was a causal relationship though the result was not within the contemplation of or purpose of defendant, where the same kind of harm or injury was contemplated by him though the precise harm or injury was different or occurred in a different way. To the extent that prior decisions were inconsistent with the opinion, the court overruled them.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 87-3-112, after the District Court of the Fifth Judicial District, in and for the County of Jefferson (Montana) denied their motions to dismiss and to suppress evidence. Pursuant to the preservation of their right to do so, defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A game warden, without a warrant, entered the property of one of the defendants and observed an elk hanging near the cabin. On appeal, defendants alleged that search and subsequent seizure violated article II, &sect; 11 of the Montana Constitution. The state claimed that the game warden's presence on the property and observation of the contraband was constitutionally permissible under the open fields doctrine. The court reversed the district court's ruling on the suppression issue. The court noted that Montana's constitutional right of privacy was broader than that of the federal constitution. The rule that an individual could never have an expectation of privacy in an open field was repugnant to the state's recognition of the right of privacy absent a compelling state interest. The court noted that: (1) defendant's cabin was set back from and not observable from the road; (2) the property was fenced, with &quot;no trespassing&quot; signs posted; and (3) in the past, law officials had requested permission before entering the property. The court found that defendants had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the property. Therefore, their motion to suppress the evidence should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's denial of defendants' motion to dismiss but held that the district court erred in failing to grant defendants' motion to suppress evidence obtained after officials entered one defendant's property without permission or a warrant and observed the elk carcass.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee power company filed a condemnation action to secure an easement over the land of appellant railroad. The Eighth District Court of Cascade County (Montana) granted a preliminary condemnation order and order of possession of the easement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal the railroad argued that the district court erred when it found that an easement through its property was necessary for the intended use and subject to condemnation. The court rejected this argument finding that there was substantial need for the new transmission lines in the area in question and that condemnation was proper under Mont.

Code Ann. &sect; 70-30-111(3). Essentially, the railroad claimed that the property in question was already appropriated to public use. The court rejected this argument finding that &sect; 70-30-111(3) was only applicable when there were two public uses of the same property and that said uses were not compatible. The court found that the railroad's use was compatible with the power company's use of the property. Finally, both parties proposed certain conditions for inclusion in the final condemnation order.

The court found that the characterization by the employee's doctor of the employee's condition was that it was worsening, was not expected to become preclinical, and might never reach a stable condition, and her testimony that the treatments were provided &quot;as needed&quot; and for &quot;temporary relief from pain&quot; corresponded to the definition of &quot;maintenance,&quot; a noncompensable treatment, which was contained in Mont.

His first trial resulted in a hung jury and the second in conviction. Defendant filed a motion for a new trial, which was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that: (1) a juror's expression of his opinion of the law, which may have been wrong, did not indicate any outside influence on the jury as required to impeach a verdict under Mont. R. Evid. 606(b); (2) the trial court's refusal to instruct the jury on the legal obligations of a game farmer was proper when the jury had been fully and correctly instructed; (3) defendant's prior convictions for failing to maintain his fence were admissible because they were similar to the new charge, not remote in time, and demonstrated an absence of mistake or accident by defendant; and (4) Mont.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted on two counts of deliberate homicide after a jury trial before the District Court of the Nineteenth Judicial District, Lincoln County (Montana). He appealed his conviction and 84-year sentence on the ground that due process was violated by a jury instruction stating that voluntary intoxication was not to be taken into consideration in determining the existence of a mental state which was an element of the crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant owned a gun and was drinking for most of the day with two companions; that evening they were shot to death in their car, he was found in the back seat, and then behaved erratically when the police took him to the hospital. His blood alcohol level was .36 percent and he claimed to have an alcohol-induced blackout. He was convicted of two deliberate homicides. The trial court's jury instruction used language from Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-2-203 and stated that the jury could not consider intoxication a defense unless he proved that he did not know he consumed an intoxicating substance. On appeal, the court reversed and found that the statute impermissibly shifted the burden of proof for an element of a crime from the state to defendant, in violation of Fourteenth Amendment due process. The court held that part of &sect; 45-2-203 was unconstitutional and applied its &quot;new&quot; rule of constitutional law to all cases before it still subject to direct review as of the date of the opinion, but declined to apply it retroactively to cases on collateral review after the date of its opinion.</SPAN></P>

The condemnation complaint did not mention that part of the visitor center was a planned area for the city chamber of commerce. A preliminary condemnation order was issued but, after an appeal, the case was remanded for the trial court's consideration of the chamber's presence and a determination of whether that presence was &quot;de minimus. The court affirmed the trial court's determination that the presence was not de minimus and that the chamber could have no part in locating its offices on any section of the condemned property. The trial court, upon determining that the chamber's presence was not de minimus, correctly then severed the chamber's offices from future plans for the rest area. Moreover, the condemnation was not required to have been negated after severing the chamber's offices. The loss of the chamber's participation did not limit the taking. The same amount of land was required to be taken regardless of the chamber's presence.</SPAN></P>

The gas lessee intervened in the action, claiming to have rights to the oil and gas in the subject property. The trial court held that the coal seam methane gas in question belonged to the coal lessee and that the gas lessee had committed a trespass by drilling a well to collect the gas. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the coal seam gas did not belong to the coal lessee because the gas was not part of the coal and thus could be severed, it was not part of the coal estate, and the coal lessee's lease did not contain any language granting the right to the coal seam gas.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees' compensation system incorporated basic pay levels and a series of steps within each level. The employees contended that it had been the practice of state agencies to take away steps when promoting employees more than one grade. The promoted employee did not actually suffer a reduction in compensation, but he would have received less of a pay increase than he would have received without the reduction in steps. The departments issued a written memorandum of a plan to reinstate the employees' steps. Before the lost steps were reinstated, the governor sent a memorandum to the departments prohibiting them from reinstating the steps lost to multi-grade promotions. The employees filed an action seeking declaratory relief. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of respondents. The court noted that in order for there to have been an unconstitutional impairment of contract, there had to have been a contract in existence. The court held that the employees failed to demonstrate the existence of any contract under which they had a vested right to reinstatement of the lost steps, and therefore, there were no contractual obligation impaired by the governor's actions.</SPAN></P>

The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the city and the fort preservation corporation, determining that the act of zoning the property was legislative in nature and, therefore, subject to referendum by the electorate. On appeal, the court upheld the summary judgment, holding that the district court correctly interpreted Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 7-5-131 to mean that referendum by the people was appropriate for both zoning ordinances and &quot;amended&quot; zoning ordinances (or rezoning).</SPAN></P>

When the United States Supreme Court reversed previous case law that excluded state jobs from coverage under the FLSA, the state responded by reducing the firefighters' hourly wages. The court affirmed summary judgment in favor of the firefighters, concluding that the uncontroverted evidence established a violation of the FLSA. The court rejected the state's assertion of an economic necessity defense. The court also rejected the state's contention that the firefighters ratified the wage cuts when they signed agreements that reduced their hourly wage. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it awarded liquidated damages under 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 216(b), finding that the state did not objectively demonstrate good faith or reasonable grounds under 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 260.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A cash bond was deposited into the county's trust account to satisfy a condition of bail in a criminal action. A guilty plea was entered, and the individual was sentenced. The bond was exonerated, with half applied toward restitution and half returned to the individual. The individual unsuccessfully submitted a claim to the county for the accrued interest. The trustee then instituted an action for the individual, successfully filing a motion for full summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. The court examined relevant statutes, stating that they did not indicate whether a defendant was entitled to the interest generated by a cash bond during the time of deposit. After an examination of relevant case law, the court found that the state could not transform private property into public property without compensation, even for the limited duration of the deposit of the bond with the county. The court therefore stated that the retention of earned interest on that money would amount to a taking of the individual's property in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and Mont. Const. art. II., &sect; 29.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contestant brought a petition to set aside the election of the contestee as an irrigation district commissioner. The trial court granted the petition on the basis that the contestee did not own land within the district and thus did not satisfy the statutory freeholder requirement of Mont.

Every district was divided into divisions, which were represented by commissioners possessing the qualifications set forth in &sect; 85-7-1501. Pursuant to that section, the court said, a person was not entitled to be a commissioner unless he owned irrigable land within the division. The court found that the contestee did not own land within the division for which he was elected commissioner. Further, the court rejected the contestee's claim that the ownership requirement violated the equal protection clause of the federal constitution. The court said that the statute was subject to review under the standard of whether it was reasonably related to a legitimate state objective.

Defendant had been convicted at a bench trial of possession of .05 grams of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, and driving under the influence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer pulled defendant over after he was observed weaving and speeding. Defendant refused to stop for four miles. When the officer approached the vehicle, he noticed defendant fumbling around on the passenger side of the car. He also saw numerous firearms within defendant's immediate reach, ammunition, and an empty holster. The officer frisked defendant. The officer felt a lump in defendant's pocket and he retrieved a brass pipe. The district court granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence before his trial. The state appealed the order, and the court reversed and remanded for trial. The court held that the officer's actions were within the bounds of a proper stop and frisk. The court noted that it one purpose of a stop and frisk was to protect the officer from deadly weapons, and it was unrealistic to limit the officer's search to a weapon of a specified size. The court held that once the brass pipe was removed, it was in plain view, and the officer had probable cause to conclude that the brass pipe was drug paraphernalia. The court noted that, in the alternative, the search was proper as a search incident to a lawful arrest.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the district court applied the proper standard of review in this case. The court noted that the standard of review under the Montana Administrative Procedure Act required the court to determine whether the agency's decision was arbitrary or capricious or characterized by an abuse of discretion. The court further found that it was an abuse of discretion for an agency to modify the findings of a hearing examiner unless the agency first determined from a review of the entire record that the findings of fact were not based on competent substantial evidence. The court found that the hearing examiner's findings were based on competent substantial evidence and, therefore, that the agency abused its discretion when it rejected those findings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor contended that the district court erred in granting the receptionist's motion in limine restricting evidence of negligence attributable to her employer. Finding that the district court's holding was correct, the court affirmed the judgment. After the contractor removed the stairs outside the rear door of the receptionist's place of employment, the employer stated that he would make sure that the door was bolted during business hours and that he would put up a warning sign to prevent use of the rear door. Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-1-703 specifically removed from consideration and determination by the fact finder any amount of negligence on the part of an injured person's employer to the extent that such employer had tort immunity under Montana's Workers' Compensation Act. It was undisputed that the employer was immune from tort liability for the receptionist's injuries because she was covered by and received benefits under his workers' compensation insurance. Because the employer was absolutely immune from tort liability injuries, any amount of his negligence that caused or contributed to the receptionist's injuries could not be considered or determined by the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The franchisees alleged that the franchisor's award of the franchisees' preferred location to another franchisee breached a verbal agreement giving the franchisee the exclusive right to open a store at that location when it became available, and that the award defrauded the franchisees and breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The franchisor alleged that the franchisees were bound by a choice-of-law provision applying Connecticut law, rather than &sect; 27-5-114(4) of Montana's Uniform Arbitration Act, codified at Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-5-114(4), which required that the contract contain notice that it was subject to arbitration on the first page in order to be valid. The appellate court held that (1) Montana law applied where it would have been applicable absent an effective choice of law by the parties and application of Connecticut law would have been contrary to the fundamental policy of Montana by eliminating the statutory notice requirement, and (2) Montana's notice requirement was not preempted by &sect; 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act (act), 9 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1 et seq., where the notice requirement did not undermine the act's goals and policies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was killed in an automobile accident as a passenger in a vehicle that collided with a construction sign owned by the tortfeasor. The jury returned a special verdict finding the tortfeasor 35 percent negligent and that the non-party driver was 65 percent negligent for proximately causing the decedent's injuries and death. The jury awarded wrongful death damages to the decedent's estate but adjusted that amount to reflect the 35 percent negligence attributable to the tortfeasor. The jury also awarded the decedent's estate zero dollars in survivorship damages. The personal representative filed a motion for a partial new trial on the issue of survivorship damages, which the district court denied. On appeal, the court reversed the jury's survivorship damages verdict and, on remand, directed reinstatement of the full wrongful death award. The evidence was either stipulated to or offered without contradiction. Thus, the jury was compelled to award survivorship damages for the decedent's personal injuries. The court also found that, because there was insufficient evidence to justify the jury's survivor damages verdict, a partial new trial should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

The state argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in finding that the military service requirement was unconstitutional, while the firefighter argued that it erred for denying him attorney fees. The court affirmed the trial court's decision, holding that the state failed to offer any compelling evidence that the military service was rationally related to a legitimate government interest and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the firefighter attorney fees request because the state's defense was not frivolous or pursued in bad faith.</SPAN></P>

Police interviewed defendant, and the defendant waived his Miranda rights. Defendant admitted he had a gun and offered to get it. A police officer that was a friend of defendant drove defendant to his house.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in justice court and in city court of operating a motor vehicle without liability insurance, of operating an unregistered motor vehicle, and of not wearing a seat belt. A district court upheld these convictions. On further appeal, the court affirmed, rejecting defendant's contention that because he was a &quot;free&quot; man who was not a &quot;Fourteenth&quot; Amendment citizen he did not have to obey state or federal statutes concerning vehicle registration, wearing a seatbelt, or maintaining liability insurance. The court explained that state governments had the inherent power to enact reasonable regulations concerning the health, safety, welfare, and morals of the public. Such reasonable regulations include requirements for registration, insurance, and seatbelt usage, the court said. Recognizing that the statutes defendant violated were regulatory in nature, the court said that no person in the state was exempt from regulatory statutes, even if he claimed he was a &quot;free&quot; man who did not have to obey state or federal law. Given defendant's failure to show that the statutes were unreasonable, his constitutional rights were not violated by requiring his adherence to them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife and the husband were involved in a common law marriage. The wife informed the husband that he was the father of the child. Due to a mix-up at the county registrar's office, the husband was not listed as the father on the child's birth certificate. The court held that the wife's claim seeking to declare the nonexistence of the father-child relationship was not time-barred after five years under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-108(1)(b) (1983), which was the statute of limitations in effect at the time of the child's birth, because the statute had been held unconstitutional. The court also found that it was appropriate to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel to the case because the wife told the husband that he was the father of the child, the husband relied on that statement, and it would be both unconscionable and inequitable to allow the wife to claim that the husband was not the father in order to advance her own self-serving interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the district court abused its discretion when it admitted testimony of prior acts, that the evidence presented was insufficient to convict him of solicitation of sexual assault, that a jury instruction on solicitation given was improper, that the district court erred in admitting the testimony of two expert witnesses who were not identified as experts prior to trial, and that the cumulative error committed required the conviction to be reversed. The court reversed the conviction on the grounds that the admission of prior acts that occurred approximately 16 to 18 years before the charged conduct was prejudicial error as the prior acts were too remote in time. The only error found was the admission of the prior acts evidence. The evidence used to prove solicitation of sexual assault was legally sufficient but whether such evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction upon retrial was solely within the province of the finder of fact upon a new trial. While the State erred in not disclosing the status of the experts and in failing to provide their statements, there was no prejudice given defendant knew their identity for over eight months before trial.</SPAN></P>

The department also appealed. Plaintiff claimed that they were entitled to a new trial because a negligence allocation statute,&nbsp;Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-1-703, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Co-guardians ad litem brought suit on behalf of a foster child against the child's former foster parents, the foster parents' counselor, a state employee, and a state social services department for injuries the child received while in foster care. Due to various settlements, the trial proceeded against the department alone. The jury found for the guardians and allocated negligence between the department and the nonparties under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-1-703. The guardians sought a new trial solely against the department claiming that the statute was unconstitutional because it arbitrarily prejudiced plaintiffs by requiring them to exonerate nonparties. The department also appealed. Because the guardians would suffer an economic loss if a percentage of negligence were attributed to unrepresented parties, they had standing to assert the rights of the unrepresented parties. The appellate court ruled that the statute, in part, violated substantive due process because it unreasonably mandated an allocation of percentages of negligence to nonparties without any kind of procedural safeguard. Because the statute was severable, the entire statute was not unconstitutional. Retrial was ordered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court's judgment for the guardians and remanded for a new trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county created RSID funds to assist in the development of a subdivision and agreed to issue bonds to the public to finance the improvements and to levy and collect assessments in the principal amount of the bonds against property within the RSIDs. The county created a revolving fund and agreed to authorize loans from the revolving fund to the RSID fund when assessments were deficient to pay the bond payments. The RSID property did not sell as expected, and assessments became delinquent, resulting in inadequate revenue to pay the bonds. The county filed an action for a declaratory judgment to define the county's obligations, and a bankruptcy court stated that the revolving fund was voluntary. A district court denied the underwriters' and bondholders' motion that challenged the evidence and granted the county summary judgment. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the county's obligation to make loans from the revolving fund and the obligation to levy taxes to fund the revolving fund was not an unconstitutional pledge of credit.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant injured skier sought review of the judgment of the District Court of Missoula County (Montana), which granted the motion for summary judgment filed by appellee ski area operator. The skier argued that the trial court erred in concluding as a matter of law that the skier's injury resulted from the inherent risks of skiing as set forth in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 23-2-736 (1989) of the Montana Skier Responsibility Act (Act).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The skier was injured by a rocky outcropping on the ski trail bank striking him on the knee. The operator argued that the skier was injured by a condition that presented an inherent risk of skiing, for which the operator was relieved of liability by the Act. The trial court dismissed the skier's action, finding that it was the type of claim which the Act was meant to prevent. The trial court, however, failed to specify which provision of the Act barred the skier's claim. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for trial. The court rejected the operator's contention that its duties were limited to those listed in the Act, holding that the operator also had a duty of care. The court found that whether the rocky outcropping was a condition enumerated in the Act had not been established as a matter of law, and therefore whether the skier was injured by a condition listed in the Act was a question of fact that could not be resolved on summary judgment. The court rejected the operator's argument that the skier had assumed the risk of injury. The court held that assumption of the risk, except as specified in the Act, was not a separate defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff applicants appealed from a judgment of the District Court of the First Judicial District, In and for the County of Lewis and Clark (Montana), which upheld the constitutionality of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 87-2-102(2)(1989), concerning its definition of &quot;resident&quot; for obtaining fishing, hunting, and trapping licenses in the applicants' declaratory judgment action against defendant State of Montana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed misdemeanor charges against the applicants, alleging that they made false statements in obtaining resident hunting licenses in violation of &sect; 87-2-205. The applicants filed a motion to dismiss the charges, which the justice court denied. The applicants then filed a declaratory judgment action in the district court, arguing that &sect; 87-2-102(2) was unconstitutionally vague. The district court entered judgment in the state's favor, finding that &sect; 87-2-205 was constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the applicants' facial challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 87-2-102(2) failed because at least some license applicants could have determined whether they qualified as &quot;residents.&quot; Section 87-2-102(2) required that, for a period of six months immediately preceding the application for a resident license to fish, hunt, or trap in Montana, the applicant was required to have been a resident as defined in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 1-1-215. Thus, a person who came into Montana on the day before hunting season on his or her first trip to Montana, intending to stay for only a week or two of hunting, would have known that he or she did not qualify as a &quot;resident.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision upholding the constitutionality of the statute defining &quot;resident&quot; for the purpose of obtaining a Montana fishing, hunting, or trapping license in the applicants' declaratory judgment action against the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his wife decided to divorce. Upset about the pending divorce and potential financial difficulties, defendant asked a friend to kill his wife. After speaking with the county sheriff, the friend decided to wear a wire. During defendant's next few meetings with the friend, defendant provided him with a gun, gave him detailed instructions on how the killing should occur, and promised to pay. Defendant was convicted of conspiracy to commit deliberate homicide against his wife. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court did not err by refusing defendant's proposed jury instructions on solicitation and entrapment, because the jury was properly instructed as to the definition of &quot;purposely,&quot; the mental state element of solicitation, and because inclusion of a phrase in the jury's entrapment instruction that wrongly allowed it to reject the entrapment defense was harmless error in view of additional language in the instruction. Denial of defendant's motion to dismiss and acquit on the grounds of entrapment was proper because based on the evidence defendant was not lured or induced into committing the crime, but rather developed the scheme himself.</SPAN></P>

The station cross-appealed the denial of attorney fees and questioned whether the station's request for an injunction was moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the city denied the reporter access to a meeting of city agency employees and the contractor, the station petitioned for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. The district court determined that the station was entitled to a judgment that it had a constitutional right to attend meetings between the employees and the contractor. On appeal, the court noted that the meeting was not one of a public or governmental body, board, bureau or commission. Thus, the only manner in which the meeting could have fit within the parameters of Montana's open meeting statute,&nbsp;Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-3-203, was if it could be properly construed as a meeting of a public agency. However, the city agency employees were not authorized to make rules, determine contested cases, or enter into contracts, and the open meeting statutes thus did not require the meeting to be open to the public The statutory definition of &quot;agency&quot; was not restrictive of the public's right to observe deliberations of public bodies and agencies contained in Mont. Const. Art. II, &sect; 9. The legislative history established that there was no intent to make &quot;public agencies&quot; synonymous with individual public employees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the declaratory judgment. In view of that resolution, it did not address the issues raised in the station's cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 19-4-711 was unconstitutional to the extent that it employed an unreasonable classification in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent beneficiary received retirement benefits through her deceased mother. She challenged &sect; 19-4-711 because it provided for an increase in retirement benefits for retirees or their beneficiaries over age 55 or, irrespective of age, all those receiving disability or survivorship benefits. The beneficiary did not fall under the classification entitling her to the increase because she was classified as a beneficiary, due to the fact that her mother had retired and was a beneficiary at the time of her death, and because she was under age 55. The court affirmed the trial court's finding of unconstitutionality. The trial court correctly applied the rational basis test of review. Strict scrutiny was not required because the beneficiary was not a member of a suspect class nor was a fundamental right involved. Middle tier scrutiny was not applicable to an &quot;age plus&quot; classification absent a constitutionally based benefit. The classification did not rationally relate to a legitimate state purpose because the purpose of the law, to grant beneficiaries, retirees' survivors, and disabled an amount to alleviate the effect of inflation, was applicable to others who were excluded.</SPAN></P>

After the creation of the rural improvement district the landowners initiated an action that sought to enjoin the county and commissioners from continuing with the rural improvement district. The trial court denied injunctive relief but directed the county and commissioners to re-notice the hearings and allow the landowners to participate further in the process because it determined that the action of the county and commissioners in adjourning the hearings and rescheduling hearings without the opportunity to protest denied the landowners their right to participate. The court reversed the decision from the trial court because it determined that the county and commissioners had followed the requirements for the formation of the rural improvement district and there was no requirement that the landowners be afforded opportunities other than the initial hearing to participate in the process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of negligent homicide, negligent vehicular assault, and failure to wear a seat belt. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant was not subject to ineffective assistance of counsel. Lay witnesses were competent to give opinion testimony as to defendant's intoxication, and there was thus no basis for counsel to object to the testimony. Counsel's performance was not deficient for failure to object to introduction of a lab report. The blood test report from the state crime laboratory was not excluded by the hearsay rule because the state complied with the notification requirements of Mont. R. Evid. 803(8). Defendant failed to make any showing that the pool of prospective jurors contained an inadequate representation of Native Americans. Thus, he failed to show that his right to a jury drawn from a cross-section of his community was violated or that discrimination based on race occurred.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the decision of the trial court.

The court further held that the statute did not violate Mont. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers and intervenor retiree association challenged the judgment of the First Judicial District, In and for the County of Lewis and Clark (Montana), which granted summary judgment to respondent state in the taxpayers' declaratory judgment action challenging the validity of 1991 Mont. Laws ch. 823, which brought all income, including state and federal pensions, within the Montana income tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers contended that ch. 823 impaired private contractual rights that exempted their pensions from state taxation in violation of Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 35; that a provision phasing out an exemption violated 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 111; and that the retirement adjustment payment of 1991 Mont. Laws ch. 823 violated 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 111. The trial court granted the state summary judgment. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in part and reversed it in part. The court held that state employees who retired prior to the effective date of 1991 Mont. Laws ch. 823 did not have a contractual right to continued exemption from state taxation because the statute the retirees relied upon contained no manifestation of legislative intent to create private and enforceable contract rights. The provision of ch. 823 phasing out the exemption did not violate 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 111 because it did not discriminate as to source of income; however, an adjustment payment to state retirees did violate &sect; 111 because it constituted discriminatory taxation based solely on the source of their retirement income. The court concluded that the invalid provisions of 1991 Mont. Laws ch. 823 could be severed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the state in the taxpayers' declaratory judgment action as to the trial court's findings that the challenged legislation did not impair private contractual rights and that a provision phasing out a tax exemption did not violate federal law. The court reversed the finding that a retirement adjustment payment did not violate federal law, but the court found that the provision was severable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A district court affirmed a STAB decision that DOR's use of a stratified sales assessment ratio study to determine a value multiplier, as applied to respondents' home, caused a disparity of treatment of taxpayers with a specified area and amounted to a denial of equal protection. On appeal, the court affirmed, noting that 1991 Mont. Laws 680, S.B. 412, authorized DOR to use a specific stratified sales ratio study to adjust property values in a given district during an appraisal cycle. Because the law in effect prior to S.B. 412 was held to have violated the appraisal provisions of state statutes requiring general and uniform appraisal, assessment, and equalization of all taxable property, S.B. 412 was enacted, requiring reappraisal of areas with widely disparate appraisals. However, the court said, the method now employed by DOR to achieve equalization might do so between areas but not between individual properties where inequities existed. The DOR did not include in its study a representative sample relating to age, condition, and other factors that determine market value. Thus, S.B. 412 was unconstitutional as relating to the appraisal process as a denial of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to two counts each of deliberate homicide and aggravated kidnapping. He presented no evidence of mitigating circumstances and requested the death penalty, which was imposed. A month later, defendant submitted motions for reconsideration of the sentence and for a psychiatric examination to establish mitigating circumstances. At a hearing on the motions, defendant testified that he had committed the offenses under the influence of alcohol and drugs. The district court appointed a psychiatrist, who concluded that none of the specified mitigating circumstances existed. The district court reimposed the death sentence. The court affirmed. The Ninth Circuit held that defendant's right to due process was violated. The district court, after another hearing, reimposed the death penalty. On appeal, the court vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing. The court held, inter alia, that the district court did not violate defendant's privilege against self-incrimination, his right to counsel, or his due process rights. However, the district court did err by failing to order a current presentence investigation and report upon resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, university students and faculty, filed suit against defendant city for injunctive and declaratory relief, arguing that Missoula, Mont., Ordinances 2480, 2505, which restricted parking in a residential area adjacent to the university to residents, violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the federal and state constitutions in that the ordinances created an unlawful distinction between residents and nonresidents. Plaintiffs also alleged that defendant exceeded its authority in enacting the ordinances. The trial court found for defendant, and plaintiffs sought review. The court affirmed, holding that defendant did not exceed its authority in enacting the parking ordinances. Mont. Const. art. XI, &sect; 4(2) supported a liberal construction of powers granted to local municipalities by the legislature. The court also held that the ordinances' distinction between residents and nonresidents did not violate the state and federal equal protection clauses. The ordinances were rationally related to the legitimate government objective of the residential interest of comparative tranquility, and thus the resident-nonresident distinction did not constitute invidious discrimination.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the district court did not err in finding that application of the Willing Provider Amendment of 1991 (amendment), Mont.

The amendment was approved on April 29, 1991 and could not be applied to a contract entered prior to that date.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant broke into a government-owned cabin and attacked the cabin's occupent when she returned, severely injuring her. Defendant was caught and charged with burglary and attempted deliberate homicide. Defendant suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, but was found competent to stand trial. The trial court convicted defendant in a bench trial and ordered him committed to the state department of institutions for placement in an appropriate facility. Defendant challenged the finding that he acted knowingly or purposely. The court affirmed the conviction because a trier of fact could have found that defendant possessed the required mental state to have committed the crimes. The presence of a mental illness did not necessarily preclude defendant from acting knowingly or purposely. Testimony from witnesses and experts indicated that defendant was coherent the day before the attack, that he mocked the occupant as she called for help, that he had a tendency to exaggerate his symptoms, and that he often lied to get out of trouble. The court also found that the homicide laws did not establish an unrebuttable presumption of criminal intent but merely established a permissive inference.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the annexation did not have the effect of diminishing the value of the landowner's property to the extent that compensation was necessary. The court ruled that a landowner necessarily expects the uses of his property to be restricted, from time to time, by various measures by the state in legitimate exercise of its police powers.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed orders from the District Court of Lewis and Clark County, First Judicial District (Montana) that found one defendant guilty of criminal trespass and disorderly conduct and one defendant guilty of criminal trespass. Defendants claimed that they were improperly barred from raising certain defenses, that the prosecution did not establish the elements of the crimes, and that exculpatory material was withheld in discovery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' convictions arose from their participation in an anti-abortion protest in which they chained themselves together and blocked the entrance to a clinic. In affirming their convictions, the court ruled that: (1) the district court properly granted the city's motion in limine to prohibit defendants from introducing evidence regarding the defense of necessity, under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-2-212, because the defense did not include imminent threats of harm to a third party and defendants did not allege that they reasonably believed that death or serious bodily injury would be inflicted upon them if they did not trespass; (2) defendants were properly barred from asserting a justifiable use of force defense because they did not prove or allege that any of the clinic's activities were &quot;unlawful&quot; under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-3-102; (3) the district court properly refused to instruct the jury on those defenses; (4) the city adequately proved the mental state required by the statutes at issue; and (5) the district court's refusal to admit defendants' proffered evidence regarding their asserted defenses did not in way amount to an unconstitutional withholding of exculpatory evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspaper wanted the police to release the name of an officer involved in an incident and to release the documents pertaining to the investigation. The newspaper also named the sheriff's department as a defendant, which did not appeal the trial court's ruling. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment that awarded attorney's fees, but remanded that portion of the trial court's judgment that denied the request for the release of the documents. The court held that the newspaper had a right to know the information under the Montana Constitution, which was only qualified by the constitutional limitation of the right to privacy of the individuals involved in the incident, pursuant to Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 10. Therefore, the court ordered that the trial court conduct an in camera inspection of the documents to determine what could be released to the newspaper after balancing the privacy rights of the alleged victim and of the witnesses with the public's right to know. Lastly, the court held that, as the prevailing party on the constitutional claim, the newspaper was properly entitled to an award of attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a city and an employee, sought review of the decision of the District Court of Gallatin County (Montana), which awarded damages to appellee construction company on its breach of contract and intentional interference with contract claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the city had wholly failed to object to the amount of damages presented by the construction company at trial. The court held that the city could not now claim that the proof of damages was speculative and excessive. The city argued that no action could be taken against its employee under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-9-305(5). The court found that the statute did not bar an action against an employee when commenced at the same time action was initiated against the city. The court stated that although &sect; 2-9-305(5) was not a model of clarity, one clear purpose behind the statute was to preclude a claimant from recovering from both the governmental entity and the governmental employee for the same conduct. The construction company recovered damages from the city. The court held that the double recovery awarded by the jury was barred by the plain language of &sect; 2-9-305(5), and on that basis, the separate award against the employee for intentional interference with contractual relations was stricken from the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the award of damages against the city, concluding that the district court did not err in permitting retrial of the issues of constructive fraud, defamation and reformation. The court reversed the award of damages against the employee, holding that it was an improper double recovery against the city and employee for the same conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant workers' compensation trust appealed an order of the Montana Worker's Compensation Court entered in favor of claimant employee in a workers' compensation action. The order stated that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-119(3)(a)-(b) (1987) violated the equal protection clause of Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee suffered a work-related psychological injury. Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-119 excluded from the definition of injury work-related injuries that did not have a physical component. The workers' compensation court found that &sect; 39-71-119 was unconstitutional because it violated the equal protection clause of Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 4. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the rational basis test was applicable because the statute did not affect any fundamental right or suspect class. It further held that the purpose of the legislation did not have to appear on the face of the legislation or in the legislative history. Upon consideration of the facts, the court determined that the legislation was presumed to be constitutional, and that the party challenging the constitutionality of a statute had the burden of proof. Under a rational basis test, denying compensation for work-related injuries that did not have a physical component was rationally related to a legitimate governmental objective of controlling the costs of the workers' compensation program and providing benefits. Thus, the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspaper published an article, which reported that the Montana Supreme Court's Commission on Practice was looking into allegations of fraud and professional conduct on the part of the attorney. The article also stated that a local building contractor had filed a complaint against the attorney with the &quot;high court,&quot; alleging fraud, professional misconduct, and failure to pay for services. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment because there were no material issues of fact. The attorney failed to meet his threshold burden of establishing the falsity of the article, which was addressed in subsequent articles by the newspaper. The articles were protected by the First Amendment as truthful information about a matter of public significance. There was no false light invasion of privacy claim when falsity was not established. The deposition testimony demonstrated the absence of any genuine issue of material fact concerning the severity of the attorney's alleged emotional distress. The attorney's negligence claim failed because the newspaper owed no duty to investigate or to maintain confidentiality. The newspaper only reported that there was an investigation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed a complaint with the commission against the nightclub, her employer, and her manager for sexual harassment prior to her termination.

The court found that the personal representative failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the administrative contested case procedures under the Human Rights Act unconstitutionally denied the decedent's right to a jury trial. The decedent was aware of the employee's complaint three months after she had been fired. All that was needed to make the decedent subject to the administrative proceeding was for the employee to allege that the manager, an agent of the decedent, committed unlawful sexual discrimination.

Code Ann. &sect; 2-9-317, in the employee's action brought against cross-appellant State in the employee's wrongful discharge action. The State appealed the assessment of half the cost of the trial transcript on appeal to the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the employee's action, the trial court rendered judgment for the employee and awarded damages, which did not provide for costs or for post-judgment interest. The employee's motion brought, pursuant to Mont. R. Civ. P. 59(g), was granted and the trial court included costs in the judgment, and interest thereon. The State filed its own Rule 59 motion, which was granted. The trial court entered a nunc pro tunc order striking the post-judgment interest from the order because of the State's immunity to post-judgment interest pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-9-317. The court affirmed, holding that the employee was not entitled to attorney fees and costs. Because the State paid the judgment amount plus costs as prescribed by the nunc pro tunc amended judgment within the two year period described in &sect; 2-9-317, interest was not appropriate. The court found that &sect; 2-9-317 was constitutional as a limitation on interest assessed against the State and did not violate either the spirit or substance of Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 18. Because both parties appealed, the trial court correctly divided the costs of the transcript, in compliance with Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 25-10-104.</SPAN></P>

The State offered a reasonable excuse for the delay between the indictment and trial where the child victim required psychological treatment before she was capable of testifying and the delay was caused by the availability of the therapist. The process followed under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-16-216 for the videotape and presentation of the child's testimony provided protection of defendant's constitutional right to confrontation by allowing him to be present and by allowing his counsel to cross-examine the witness. Defendant failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in the admission of the videotape, the denial of a continuance requested by defendant, the control of cross-examination, and the choice of jury instructions. The properly qualified expert witness properly testified directly about the credibility of the child victim when defendant attacked the credibility of the child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The land owner purchased approximately 132 acres of land and applied for approval of the creation of a six-acre tract based on an occasional sale exemption.

The district court ruled against her and she appealed. The court affirmed, finding that the regulations were not inconsistent and contradictory to the Act. The court found that the state legislature did not impermissibly delegate its authority to the Lewis and Clark County Commissioners for the regulation of subdivisions and the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act and that the subdivision regulations adopted by Lewis and Clark County pursuant to the Act were constitutional.

The trial court found that the failure to pay the benefits did not violate double jeopardy and equal protection and that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 1-18-617(2) was not impermissibly vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees were terminated as a result of a criminal investigation and alleged sexual misconduct. The employer refused to pay the employees any accrued vacation benefits. Although the employees did not challenge their termination in light of their conviction for criminal mischief, they sought a declaratory judgment that the employer was obligated to pay them accred vacation benefits. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the employer and the employees appealed, contending that the employer's refusal to pay the benefits violated double jeopardy protection and denied equal protection and that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-18-617(2) was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the refusal to pay accrued vacation benefits was not a civil sanction and therefore did not violate double jeopardy because the employees were not being subjected to different penalties for the same conduct. The court also found that the Equal Protection Clause was not violated because the employees were not discriminated against on an impermissible ground.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife and appellee husband agreed as to all the terms of their dissolution except for spousal maintenance. The wife argued that the award was improper because it failed to consider her standard of living and because it failed to account for her tax liability. The wife further challenged the termination of support upon her cohabitation. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the lower court's finding was not clearly erroneous. The record showed that the lower court did consider the couple's standard of living, noting that the wife's requested maintenance would comport with her established standard of living. While a district court must consider each of the factors in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 40-4-203(2), it was not necessary for the court to set forth a specific finding for each element. To determine the final maintenance award, all relevant facts should be considered by the court as a whole. The court reversed, holding that the lower court was assuming that if the wife was to cohabit, then there would be a substantial change in her financial circumstances. That presumption was not supported by substantial evidence and was, therefore, clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of revocation from the District Court of Flathead County, Eleventh Judicial District (Montana), which continued his suspended sentence and required defendant to pay his victim $ 10,000 additional restitution after defendant violated the terms and conditions of his suspended sentence while on parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the district court had no authority to increase his original sentence by an additional $ 10,000 in restitution. He relied on the version of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-203 (1983), which was in effect at the time of his crime and at the time of the initial sentencing. The district court relied on the 1991 revision &sect; 46-18-203 in its sentencing order. Defendant contended that he was entitled to the benefits of the former statute. The court vacated defendant's sentence in part, holding that under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 31, the district court could not order defendant to pay his victim $ 10,000 additional restitution after defendant violated the terms and conditions of his suspended sentence while on parole. The court determined that the revised statute clearly changed the legal consequences of defendant's crime by allowing the district court to change his sentence. The court concluded that the additional restitution constituted an unconstitutional increase in punishment, which defendant could not have foreseen at the time he committed his crime or when he entered into a plea agreement with the prosecutor before sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After consuming at least four cans of beer and two shots of whiskey and with a blood-alcohol level of at least .17, defendant mounted a horse described to him by the owner as &quot;hot-blooded&quot; and &quot;inexperienced.&quot; The owner of the horse warned defendant not to tug on the reins and not to give rides to children. Despite these warnings, defendant allowed a five-year-old child on the horse with him. When the horse began to jump, defendant reined the horse back. The horse fell over backward, and the child was fatally injured. Defendant was charged with and convicted of negligent endangerment in violation of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-208. He appealed his conviction. In affirming, the court concluded that, under the facts, a rational jury could find that defendant's conduct amounted to a gross deviation from the ordinary care that a reasonable person would observe in a similar situation. As such, the jury was justified in finding beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant acted negligently.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate filed a petition for mandamus, habeas corpus, and declaratory relief, seeking approval for &quot;good time&quot; credit to which he claimed entitlement based on correspondence courses he had completed. The District Court of Powell County (Montana) dismissed the inmate's petition, and the inmate appealed. The inmate also filed a second petition for habeas corpus in the appellate court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the petition for declaratory judgment because declaratory judgment was not the proper procedure for resolution of the case. The court held that a declaratory judgment was primarily intended to determine the meaning of a law or a contract and to adjudicate the rights of the parties therein, but not to determine controverted issues of fact such as facts which give rise to a claim of denial of procedural due process. The resolution of the questions in this case involved factual determinations prior to any consideration of due process or equal protection. The court held further that the inmate failed to present facts that warranted habeas corpus. The court held that because a liberty interest was created only when the enabling statute specifically constrained or limited the discretion of the decision maker, and such constraint was absent here, the inmate did not have a liberty interest in &quot;good time&quot; credits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's order dismissing the inmate's petition for declaratory judgment and denied the inmate's application for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employee appealed a decision from the District Court of Lewis and Clark County in the First Judicial District (Montana), which declared Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-31-204&nbsp;unconstitutional. The employee alleged that respondents, union and State of Montana Department of Labor and Industry Board of Personnel Appeals (Board of Personnel Appeals), violated her rights of non-association under &sect; 39-31-204 and to exercise her religious beliefs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee's employment was subject to a collective bargaining agreement. The union allowed the payment of an agency fee in lieu of joining the union. The employee objected to payment of the agency fee on religious grounds because the union publicly supported legalized abortion and birth control. The employee sent a letter to the union and to the Board of Personnel Appeals. The employee was informed that she did not qualify for non-association under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-31-204. The employee sought judicial review, and the district court declared &sect; 39-31-204&nbsp;unconstitutional. The court chose to consider the freedom of religion claim even though the district court did not address it because it was a fundamental right. The court indicated that the case could be decided without ruling on the constitutionality of &sect; 39-31-204. The court focused on the issue of religious discrimination by employers and unions under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000e et seq.; Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 49-2-101 et seq. The court concluded that the issue was whether the unions reasonably accommodated the employee's religious beliefs and remanded for a determination of that issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the decision from the district court, which had declared unconstitutional a statute regarding public employees' right of non-association with and non-financial support of unions based upon certain religious grounds. The court remanded the case to the Board of Personnel Appeals to determine whether the union offered a reasonable accommodation of the employee's religious beliefs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant newspaper sought review of the declaratory judgment of the District Court of Cascade County (Montana) in the newspaper's action against the Great Falls Public Schools, Board of Trustees (school board) that the collective bargaining strategy exception to the open meeting law, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-3-203(4), did not violate Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before an open meeting to discuss a report regarding labor negotiations, the school board met privately to discuss the report. At the open meeting, the report was rejected without discussion. The newspaper, which attended the open meeting, filed an action against the school board, alleging violation of the open meeting laws, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-3-203 and Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 9. The school board counterclaimed, seeking a declaratory judgment that meetings that it held were lawful pursuant to the collective bargaining strategy exception to the open meeting law, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-3-203(4), and that &sect; 2-3-203(4) was constitutional. The trial court granted the school board's motion for summary judgment on its counterclaim. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court ruled that art. II, &sect; 9 was unambiguous and capable of interpretation without extrinsic aids. Article II, &sect; 9 mandated that meetings be closed only when the need for individual privacy exceeded the merits of public disclosure. Thus, the court ruled that the collective bargaining strategy exception to the open meeting law, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-3-203(4), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, who ran a large-scale poaching operation, were arrested after an undercover investigation. The jury convicted each defendant of two counts of felony criminal mischief. As a condition of defendants' partially suspended sentences, the district court charged both defendants with restitution for the value of the wild game they illegally killed, the cost of the jury trial, and investigation expenses incurred by the state. On appeal, the court affirmed defendants' convictions. The court held that: (1) under Montana's police powers, the state could regulate and/or prohibit the killing of wild game; (2) wild animals were &quot;public property&quot; within the meaning of Montana's criminal mischief statute,&nbsp;&sect; 45-6-101(1)(a); and (3) the prosecutor had the discretion to charge defendants with felony criminal mischief, because the misdemeanor provisions of Mont. Code Ann. tit. 87 did not provide an exclusive remedy for the illegal taking of game. The court did, however, hold that defendants' restitution for investigation expenses should have been limited to the amount paid directly to defendants for guided hunts and for meat and animal parts purchased in the undercover investigation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A federal court held that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 69-4-511, which made the water company responsible for the cost of maintaining water service pipelines from the main to the owner's property line, was a taking of private property for a public use and that the water company could seek just compensation through rate setting for its property taken. Appellant public service commission denied the water company's request for a rate increase to reimburse it for prior expenses under &sect; 69-4-511 but granted the application for an increase to compensate the water company for future expenses. The trial court held that the public service commission's refusal to allow recovery of prior expenses failed to justly compensate the water company for the taking. The court held that public utility rates had to be set to match utility costs during the period the rates were in effect. The court ruled that rate-making was a legislative activity and was therefore prospective only in its effect and that the water company could not set its rates so as to amortize past deficits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DOR contended that double jeopardy did not attach to the Drug Tax because the tax was an excise tax for raising revenue, not a criminal penalty or civil sanction. Defendants contended that the Drug Tax was a criminal penalty, and thus, violated double jeopardy. The court concluded that the Legislature clearly intended to create a tax not a criminal sanction. The tax did not impose any affirmative disability or restraint upon a taxpayer. A taxpayer was required to pay an assessment based on the quantity of drugs in his possession and was not subject to incarceration or any other restraint of his liberty or privileges. The tax had a remedial purpose other than promoting retribution and deterrence. The tax collected was used for youth evaluations, chemical aftercare, chemical abuse assessments, and juvenile detention facilities. The tax was based on possession and storage of dangerous drugs. Although the conduct of possessing dangerous drugs subjected taxpayers to both a criminal penalty and a tax, it was not so punitive in purpose or effect that it negated the legislative intent to create a civil sanction. The tax was not a multiple punishment and did not violate double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the children had excessive absences and sexual abuse was suspected, the DFS investigated. Several hearings were held at which the parents were not represented.

After 10 months of the parents refusing to abide by the plan or to take any action to improve the lives of the children, the DFS petition the court to terminate the parental rights. At such hearing, counsel was appointed for the parents. On appeal, the court held that while the trial court was incorrect in taking judicial notice of the prior proceedings and incorporating those findings into its final order, the due process rights of the parents were not violated and were satisfied by the appointment of counsel prior to the termination hearing. The criteria of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 41-3-609 were satisfied because the children were adjudicated to be youths in need of care, the parents failed to comply with the treatment plan, and the parents' conduct causing the problem could not be rectified within a reasonable time.</SPAN></P>

Honzel, Judge presiding.  <BR>Board of Dentistry v. Kandarian, 248 Mont. 444, 813 P.2d 409, 1991 Mont. LEXIS 135 (Mont., 1991)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a licensed denturist, challenged an order of the First judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County (Montana), which dismissed his complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief. Respondent state board of dentistry had filed a Mont. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The trial court held that the complaint did not present a justiciable controversy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denturist sought approval to enter into a business association with a dentist regarding fees and compensation. The board issued a letter informing the denturist that if he went ahead with his proposal he would be illegal practicing dentistry, and would be risking his denturist license. In his action for declaratory relief, the denturist requested the court to decide whether he could enter into such a business association. The court found that the letter from the board was advisory in nature and was not a final opinion from which an appeal could be taken. The court held that by using the Declaratory Judgment Act, the denturist was attempting to seek an advisory opinion from the court regarding his rights under Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 37-4-103 and 37-29-103, which would be an unwarranted intrusion into the board's regulatory authority. Additionally, the court held that the denturist had not exhausted his administrative remedies, nor raised a constitutional issue such that the requirement to exhaust his administrative remedies could be excepted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners sought review of an order of the Montana State Water Court that held the owners' water rights forfeit for their failure to timely file a claim pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 85-2-226. The water court upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 85-2-226, finding that its application worked as a forfeiture and not an abandonment. The owners asserted that &sect; 85-2-226 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action was initiated sua sponte through an order of the Chief Water Judge. The law governing Montana's water rights adjudication required pre-1973 water claims to be filed with the Department of Natural Resources by a certain date or be conclusively presumed abandoned. The water court consolidated 109 late claims filed in the Yellowstone River Basin. The water court entered a judgment that the owners' late claims were conclusively abandoned under &sect; 85-2-226. The owners sought review, and the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that Mont. Const. art. IX, &sect; 3 did not establish that pre-1973 water rights were immune from sovereign powers. The court ruled that these rights, like other property rights, were protected against unreasonable state action; however, they were not granted indefeasible status. The court concluded that consistent with Mont. Const. art. IX, &sect; 3(1), the Montana legislature could enact constitutionally sound regulations, including the requirement for property owners to take affirmative actions to maintain their water rights. Section 85-2-226 satisfied the guarantees of substantive due process and was not a taking without just compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the water court against the property owners and upheld the constitutionality of a state statute that conclusively presumed water rights were forfeited if the water claims were not filed by a date certain.</SPAN></P>

Respondents, Secretary of State, election administrators, and the State of Montana, filed a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A referendum measure identified as House Bill 19, otherwise known as the &quot;Treasure State Endowment,&quot; was set to appear on an election ballot. The bill was not subjected to the veto power of the governor because it was not submitted for his signature. Petitioners applied for a writ of injunction to prevent the referendum. Petitioners also sought to declare the bill unconstitutional. The court denied the injunction, holding that Mont. Const. art. VI, &sect; 10, art. III, &sect; 5 clearly provided that legislation calling for a referendum measure did not require the governor's signature. Also, the referendum measure, which was a measure redirecting coal severance tax, was not an appropriations measure. Thus, Mont. Const. art. III, &sect; 5 did not prevent its submittal to the people as a ballot issue. Further, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 13-27-310(2) required a copy to be transmitted to the attorney general at least six months before the election. However, the court held that the particular intent in the referendum that it was to be on a special election ballot on a specified day controlled over the statement of general intent set forth at &sect;13-27-310(2).</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the workers' compensation court or the ERD were the proper authorities to determine the reasonableness of attorney fees and exercise discretion in their regulation. The court stated that the more difficult question was whether Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-613 denied due process of law and equal protection of the law. The court held that the attorney had not set forth a factual or legal analysis to support his constitutional claims, nor had he shown any injury that had resulted from the legislation regulating attorney fees. The court held that &sect; 39-71-613 and the department's application of the statute to a claimant's attorney fees was rationally related to the government's legitimate interest in protecting the claimant's net benefits in workers' compensation cases.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court affirmed the two statutory violations and the denial of the agent's motion to amend. The court affirmed the summary judgment granted the commissioner in her official capacity because an official was not a person for &sect; 1983 purposes. In holding that the commissioner was not absolutely immune from personal liability under &sect; 1983 for all of her official actions, the court reversed the summary judgment granted on the agent's allegations of the sign removal, the business closing, and the notifications of his suspended license.

The court held that where a claimant was forced to settle for the limits of an insurance policy which, together with claimant's workers' compensation award, did not grant full legal redress under general tort law to the claimant, under workers' compensation laws the insurer was not entitled to subrogation rights under Mont.

The court also held that the statute was not unconstitutionally over broad as it specified that the act of removing specified body parts without utilizing the rest of the animal was illegal. The court also found that the district court did not err in failing to instruct the jury as to criminal intent. The court held that Mont.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order of the District Court for the Thirteenth Judicial District, Yellowstone County (Montana), which convicted him on a jury verdict of deliberate homicide, in violation of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-102, and attempted deliberate homicide. The trial court sentenced defendant to 100 years in prison on each count, plus 10 additional years on each count for the use of a dangerous weapon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lent money to the victim of the homicide to complete a drug deal. When the victim failed to share the profits, defendant tracked him down and shot him. He also shot another person on the scene before fleeing. The sole issue was whether the jury was properly instructed on the lesser-included offense of mitigated deliberate homicide pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-103. The court held that mitigated deliberate homicide was a lesser-included offense of deliberate homicide only if defendant presented evidence that he acted under extreme mental or emotional stress for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse. The court noted that defendant did not object to the trial court's instructions. With regard to defendant's claim of constitutional error, the court opined that the requirement that defendant prove by a preponderance of the evidence the presence of mitigating facts in support of the affirmative defense did not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof to defendant. The court concluded that nothing prevented the jury's consideration of mitigating evidence and that &sect; 45-5-103(2) did not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff retired federal employees (employees) challenged a decision of the District Court of the First Judicial District, in and for the County of Lewis and Clark (Montana) that denied summary judgment to the employees and held that they were not entitled to refunds for state taxes they had paid on their retirement benefits in their action seeking a declaratory judgment that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-30-111(2)(c)(i) (1989) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Montana statute exempted state employees from state and local taxation of retirement benefits, but &sect; 15-30-111(2)(c)(i) made federal employees' benefits taxable. After a 1988 holding by the United States Supreme Court that a similar taxation scheme in another state was invalid, the parties stipulated that &sect; 15-30-111(2)(c)(i) was invalid after 1988. The employees sought retroactive application of the holding and a refund for taxes paid between 1983 and 1988. The court affirmed the trial court decision refusing to apply the holding retroactively. The holding was not foreshadowed by the longstanding principle of intergovernmental tax immunity because it required three extensions of former law and directly contradicted prior law by replacing the equal protection standard with a new, &quot;significant difference&quot; standard to be applied in state tax discrimination cases. The court determined that refunds as a result of retroactive application of the holding would not promote the concept of intergovernmental tax immunity because the tax was not illegal when it was imposed. The court held that it would have been inequitable to impose the burden of paying refunds on Montana taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision denying summary judgment to the employees and holding that they were not entitled to refunds for state taxes they had paid on their retirement benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant car repairer appealed a judgment of the First Judicial District, in and for the County of Lewis and Clark, Montana, which affirmed the Small Claims Division's monetary award to plaintiff owner for damage to her car that occurred while the car was in the repairer's control. The issues included whether the prohibition in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 25-35-803 of a trial de novo in the district court violated the repairer's due process guarantees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A mechanic admitted that at least some of the damage occurred while the car was in his possession. On appeal, the court noted that, in an earlier case, it held that the right to counsel in civil cases was implicit in the due process guarantees of the Montana Constitution. Nevertheless, the court rejected the repairer's argument that the combined prohibitions of the appearance of attorneys and trial de novo in the small claims court, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 25-35-505(2), violated that right. The court pointed out that, under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 25-35-602, defendant in a small claims action had to be given notice of his right to remove the case to justice's court and failure to do so waived the rights to counsel and to a jury trial. The repairer did not deny receiving such a warning. The court held that it was no longer unconstitutional to prohibit de novo appeals. Further, under Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 25-35-501, 25-35-702, the goal of the small claims court was to provide a speedy remedy, for which a small claims judge was given broad discretion in controlling the admissibility of testimony and exhibits. The court held the record contained sufficient evidence to support the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff news organizations filed a petition for writ of supervisory control, injunction pendente lite, and declaratory relief. The organizations alleged that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-11-701(6) was an unconstitutional deprivation of the public's right to know guaranteed by Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 9.The State conceded that the statute was unconstitutional. The State Bar's criminal defense section filed an amicus curiae brief opposing the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-11-701(6) required that an affidavit filed in support of a motion for leave to file a charge or warrant had to be sealed unless a judge determined that disclosure of the information in the affidavit was required to protect the health, safety, or welfare of the public. The organizations claimed that the statute irreparably harmed their ability to gather and disseminate information about pending criminal matters, and they sought a declaratory judgment that the statute was unconstitutional. The court granted the organizations' petition and held that the statute violated the right to know guaranteed by Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 9. There was nothing in the legislative record to indicate that the legislature determined that, or even considered whether, individual privacy requires that the affidavits described in the statute had to be sealed. Nor did the statute require such an evaluation by district judges in individual cases. The standard that affidavits had to be sealed was the antithesis of the standard required under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 9. Thus, the court ordered that &sect; 46-11-701(6) be stricken from the laws of Montana.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that, to allow the senior appropriators to present evidence of the junior appropriators' water rights could essentially lead to the readjudication of water rights claimed in the creek. The court determined that the district court had not erred in upholding the hearing examiner's decision to use the temporary preliminary decree as prima facie evidence of the junior appropriators' water rights rather than to allow the senior appropriators to present evidence of those rights.
