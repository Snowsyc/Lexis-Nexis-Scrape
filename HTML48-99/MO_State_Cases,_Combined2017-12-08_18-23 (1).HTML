</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Oregon County (Missouri), which entered a judgment of conviction, after a jury trial, for first degree murder, in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.020 (1994), and armed criminal action, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571.015 (1994). Defendant challenged a jury instruction based upon Mo. Approved Instructions-Crim. 3d 310.50, and he also alleged ineffectiveness of trial counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly had been drinking at the time he shot his acquaintance. He filed a notice of his intention to rely on the defense of mental disease or defect to exclude responsibility. A psychologist testified that defendant suffered from psychotic episodes and &quot;blackouts due to alcoholism.&quot; Instruction 310.50, based upon Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 562.076, was given, stating that the State had to prove each element of the crime and that intoxication would not relieve a person of responsibility for his conduct. Defendant contended that the instruction and statute violated his due process rights and his right to a defense. The challenge was not made at trial, and the court found no plain error in the instruction. The instruction did not shift to defendant the burden of proof as to mental state because the jury was told that the State had the burden of proof. Statutes similar to &sect; 562.076 were found not to violate due process rights. Defendant failed to seek relief under Mo. R. Crim. P. 29.15 for his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Therefore, the failure constituted a waiver of that right, and the issue could not be brought for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a order of the Circuit Court of Greene County (Missouri), which on remand, sentenced him as a persistent offender under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.016.6 (1986) for a class D felony of conspiracy to commit distribution of methaamphetamines and marijuana. Defendant appealed an order, which denied his motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.15 by which he sought resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was originally sentenced for a class B felony, but his case was remanded with instructions that he be resentenced for a class D felony committed by a prior and persistent offender. Defendant was resentenced to a 7-year term of imprisonment. The State argued that the court lacked jurisdiction to consider the direct appeal because defendant did not file an affidavit of indigency until more than 10 days after the clerk received notice of his appeal. The court affirmed the sentence and the dismissal of defendant's motion for post-conviction relief under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.15. The court found the appeal was properly before it because the trial court made a determination of defendant's indigency based on a prior affidavit. The court held that defendant was found to be a persistent offender and that his new sentence did not impose greater punishment than was imposed by his original sentence. Defendant's new sentence was a term of 7 years whereas his original punishment was 12 years and the new sentence was within the range of punishment for class D felonies committed by persistent offenders under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.016.6(4).</SPAN></P>

The trial court convicted defendant of five counts of sodomy. Defendant contended that the trial court erred when it admitted the victim's testimony because she was in the courtroom in violation of the witness exclusionary rule. The court held that: (1) where the testimony of the offending witness was offered for the limited purpose of impeachment and not as part of the offering party's case-in-chief, courts were more receptive to the evidence; (2) when such witnesses testified in rebuttal and not on a matter for the prosecution's case-in-chief, there was no abuse of discretion when a court decided not to exclude the testimony; (3) the victim's testimony related to nonessential issues that did not directly relate to defendant's guilt or innocence of the crimes charged or the elements of the offenses; thus, there was no abuse of discretion when the trial court let the victim testify on rebuttal; and (4) the prosecution presented no direct evidence that that defendant placed his penis in the victim's hand to commit sodomy; thus, there was insufficient evidence to submit count IV to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a jury verdict finding him guilty of second degree murder of his step-daughter in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.021.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed it was reversible error to admit a portion of his confession in which he stated that he wanted to pay with his life. The court rejected the claim because under Missouri law he could not complain of evidence that he introduced at trial. Furthermore, his statement did not constitute impermissible lay opinion as defendant claimed, but rather was an admissible statement that showed consciousness of guilt and his remorse. In addition, the statement was not prejudicial where the state did not seek the death penalty originally, nor did it seek to increase his punishment in light of the statement. The prosecutor's questioning of a law enforcement agent, who interviewed defendant and obtained his confession, about who brought up defendant's statement that he did not rape his step-daughter was objectionable but did not constitute reversible error because it was relevant to show only that defendant attempted to conceal his crime by stripping the body to make it look like rape by another person. Finally, the refusal to pay single mothers' childcare cost so that they could sit on the jury was proper and did not violate defendant's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State, at the relation of appellant landowners, challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court of Clay County, Missouri, in favor of appellees, a village and others. The trial court had determined that a prior decision disposed of the remaining issues in the landowners' multi-count petition. On remand, the landowners challenged the dismissal of their remaining counts in their action challenging appellees' zoning practices.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners claimed that Village of Oakwood, Mo., Ordinance No. 10 was unconstitutional on its face, unconstitutional &quot;as applied&quot; to the landowners, and violative of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89.40 (1986) sans a comprehensive plan. The trial court ruled on the facial claim and the statutory claim, but did not rule on the &quot;as applied&quot; claim. The landowners raised other constitutional claims and also asserted that by not allowing commercial development of the landowners' land, the village has accomplished an inverse condemnation. In addition to a request for relief by certiorari on the village's failure to follow proper procedures, which was dismissed before summary judgment in the prior action was granted, they sought mandamus to compel the village to grant the landowners a commercial use of the property. The court held that: (1) to the extent of the issues that it reached, the prior adjudication was the law of the case; (2) therefore, the trial court had properly dismissed the counts; (3) however, because the &quot;as applied&quot; constitutional argument was dicta it was not binding on the trial court; and (4) in fairness the landowners could, on remand, present this issue to the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the judgment from the trial court. The court affirmed the judgment dismissing the landowners' count alleging State constitutional procedural due process violations and otherwise reversed. The court remanded the cause for further proceedings on the landowners' remaining counts alleging other constitutional violations, inverse condemnation, and seeking mandamus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teachers alleged that the school district's salary conversion table discriminated against them and arbitrarily denied them the benefits they were entitled to as established by the board's past practices. The trial court found that the conversion tables were arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful. On appeal, the court reversed. The court agreed with appellants that the trial court erred in not barring the teachers' claims for backpay for the school years 1987-1990 on the ground of laches. The court found that there was no dispute that the teachers knew of the grievance process in each of the years for which they claimed backpay. The court noted that the statutory timetable placed upon the school districts' budgeting and the very short statute of limitations demonstrated a legislative intent that disputes over yearly school budgets should be handled quickly. The court also found that the trial court erred in finding that the conversion tables were arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful.

Ann. tit. 3, &sect; 10-9.220 (1994), were unconstitutionally vague and that the evidence was insufficient to support the judgment. The court held that: (1) because Mo. Rev.

The court found that defendant was not entitled to relief because he offered the second degree instruction and he could not obtain a new trial on the basis that the court submitted an instruction offered by defendant.

The priest appealed from the decision allowing the cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured person filed an action against the priest and the diocese to recover damages for injuries sustained as a result of alleged sexual abuse by the priest. The trial court dismissed all the allegations except the intentional infliction of emotional distress allegation against the priest. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in part and reversed it in part. It reasoned that any recovery for emotional distress would be duplicative of part of the recovery for a battery claim and that there was no independent action for intentional infliction of emotional distress where the existence of the claim was dependent on a battery. The court held that the injured person's negligent supervision claim against the diocese did not violate the First Amendment. It reasoned that by permitting the claim, it imposed a perfectly neutral principle of law without singling out any particular group or religion. The court stated that imposing a duty on the church to monitor its clerics to insure that they did not engage in illegal conduct was an insignificant intrusion on religious liberty when balancing the slight, and probably rare, intrusion against the interests of the church.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The divorce decree granted the mother custody and ordered the father to pay child support. When the mother filed a motion to modify child support, the father filed a cross motion for a reduction in his obligation. The mother's motion was dismissed without prejudice but the cross motion was tried to a family court commissioner who filed findings and recommendations reducing the father's child support obligation. The mother then sought a hearing before the family court judge, but her motion was denied. The court first determined that the decree was appealable, despite the judge's failure to enter an order confirming the commissioner's action because the commissioner's decree became the family court's decree on the effective date of a procedural amendment to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 487.030.2. The court reversed the decree's provisions reducing the father's support obligation because in determining that the father was entitled to a credit for the support of the child of his second marriage the commissioner failed to follow the Directions for Completion, Mo. Civ. P. Form 14. Because the action was based on the father's cross motion, he was ineligible, as the moving party, for that credit.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the evidence failed to show that defendants conspired to against plaintiffs as defendants terminated plaintiffs' agency agreements because of a concern that plaintiffs were moving business to competing companies.

The employee's supervisor dismissed him on these grounds. The employee appealed to the commission, asserting that he lived with his grandmother in the city.

The county tax collector did use the state's recommended formula for computing the assessment for the company's property used in interstate commerce. Instead, he used his own formula, which did not apportion the tax based upon the company's actual use of the state's roads. The trial court entered its judgment alternatively, finding that the company was entitled to relief based on the protest statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev.

The court affirmed the judgment under &sect; 139.290, because that provision did not require the company to exhaust any administrative remedies before filing suit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), which granted the motion of defendant, a corporation, to dismiss the charges against it for violations of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 290.210 et seq., the Prevailing Wages on Public Works Act, on the grounds that the statute was unconstitutional because it was vague and ambiguous. Defendant filed a motion for a transfer of the case to the Missouri Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's information alleged that defendant failed to pay the prevailing rate of wages fixed for sheetmetal workers to a workman on a public works project for specified period of time. Defendant argued successfully that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 290.210 et seq., the Prevailing Wages on Public Works Act, was unconstitutional because it was vague and ambiguous. The statute defined &quot;prevailing hourly rate of wages&quot; under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 290.210(5) in part by referring to workmen engaged in work of a similar character. Granting defendant's motion, the court found that the only issue on appeal was whether the challenged statute, and particularly that portion involving &quot;work of a similar character,&quot; was unconstitutionally vague. Under Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 3, the Missouri Supreme Court had exclusive appellate jurisdiction in all cases involving the validity of a state statute. The court concluded that the constitutional issue was real and substantial in view of the dismissal of the charges.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The expelled directors argued that the appeal should be dismissed because, as the trial court found, the underlying dispute was an ecclesiastical matter beyond the civil court's jurisdiction. The court reversed the judgment and remanded with directions. The court stated that the trial court mistakenly characterized the issue before it. The court noted that in cases of excommunication or expulsion, absent some question of the authority or procedure used, the civil courts accepted the fact of excommunication or expulsion as conclusive proof that those persons were no longer members of the church. The court determined that the true issue presented for review was whether the expelled directors qualified to continue as directors, a matter wholly within the purview of the courts. The court noted that when the incorporators decided to incorporate under the not for profit laws of the state, they submitted to the state courts' jurisdiction in all matters of a corporate nature. The court found that the trial court had jurisdiction to hear the matter presented and that it was error for the trial court to have refused to exercise that jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea agreement in which he pled guilty. Defendant did not file a Mo. R. Civ. P. [24.035] motion; therefore, the trial court denied his request for declaratory relief. On appeal, the court disagreed. The court held that Rule [24.035] did not apply because it allowed challenges only to the validity of judgments of conviction or sentences, and then only on specified grounds. Defendant's request for a declaration of his right to parole was neither an attack on his sentence or his conviction. The court held that the trial court erroneously applied the law in holding that defendant should have raised his claim in a Rule [24.035] motion. The trial court had applied a manifest injustice standard, and the court held that this standard was clearly inapplicable. The court nonetheless denied defendant's relief. The court held that defendant was incorrect when he argued that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571.015.1 gave him the right to a parole hearing after serving three years. The court held that the language of &sect; 571.015.1 was written in the prohibitive sense and not as a grant of a right. The court therefore affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant residents of a city challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri) that granted a motion for summary judgment filed by respondents, a city and the city's tax increment finance commission (TIF commission), in the residents' action seeking a declaratory judgment that a development plan using tax increment financing (TIF) pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 99 (1994) was illegal and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A development company hoped to develop a shopping center on a vacant tract of land with the assistance of preferential tax treatment. It prepared a proposed TIF plan that suggested that the tract qualified for TIF financing pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 99.810(1) (1994). The TIF commission found that the area was &quot;a blighted area and/or an economic development area&quot; and recommended adoption of the plan. The city council found that the tract was in a blighted area and adopted the plan by enacting an ordinance. In the residents' appeal from the summary judgment for respondents, the court affirmed the judgment. The suggestion of two categories rather than just one under which the tract could qualify for TIF financing in the proposed plan and by the TIF commission was inconsequential because the TIF plan adopted by the city council relied upon only one designation. The resident's second point, which alleged that the trial court otherwise erred in finding that the plan complied with Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 99 (1994), did not comply with Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 84.04(d) because it did not state reasons for the trial court's alleged failure. It therefore preserved nothing for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner's drivers license was revoked for one year. The petitioner requested a temporary injunction and a trial de novo. The lower court granted the temporary injunction pending a trial de novo. The director sought review, contending that the judge did not have subject matter jurisdiction to enjoin the director's order revoking the petitioner's driving privileges for an alcohol-related traffic offense pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 302.500-.540 (1994). On review, the court found that pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 302.535.2 (1994) the filing of a petition for trial de novo did not result in a stay of the suspension or revocation order. The court found that none of the reasons advanced by the lower court judge provided the judge with jurisdiction to issue a temporary order staying the director's order. The court thus held that because the lower court judge lacked jurisdiction to issue the restraining order on the license revocation, prohibition was the appropriate remedy.</SPAN></P>

I by not separating the state from the church. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded, holding that Missouri had not recognized a claim for clergy malpractice and the court was not going to do so, because the parishioner had other claims upon which the parishioner could recovery upon, which did not violate amend. I. The court further held that the parishioner could recover on the claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress and batter, which were supported by allegations of sexual molestation.

The Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri) dismissed all but three counts the nine-count amended petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The minor and his parents appealed, and the priest cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The priest had allegedly touched the minor in an inappropriate, offensive, and sexual manner. The priest argued that the failure of the trial court to dismiss the claims of battery, negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress against him was error. The diocese raised an immunity defense. The court found that 1) in regard to the battery, the minor was the victim, and only he could bring that claim and only against the priest; 2) the diocese was a member of society and bound by neutral laws of general applicability without offending the First Amendment and could be held liable for its tortious conduct; 3) the First Amendment prohibited a claim against the diocese for negligent hiring, ordination, or retention of the priest because judicial inquiry into church policies could foster excessive entanglement with religion, but the claim of failure to supervise was proper because imposing a duty on the church to supervise its priests created a perfectly neutral principle of law; and 5) the parents' claim regarding sexual abuse was not exclusively one for battery because the petition also supported a claim for negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded. It found that the trial court erred when it treated the motion as a dismissal because the heirs requested a judicial determination of jurisdiction. In addition, there were only three methods available to dismiss a will contest and those methods were by trial to a jury or the court; by settlement; or by voluntary dismissal with the consent of all parties not in default.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case presented the issue of whether the earnings tax ordinances of the City authorized the collection of earnings tax on amounts earned by employees which were placed in deferred compensation plans not currently taxable under federal and state income tax laws. The trial court found the tax had been collected improperly and enjoined the City from continuing to impose an earnings tax on deferred compensation plans. The trial court also ordered that the amounts paid by the taxpayers to the City be refunded with interest. The taxpayers claimed that the trial court erred in determining that refunds were not allowed for tax payments made prior to a certain date. The City claimed that the trial court erred in holding that the City did not have the authority to impose the earnings tax and in ordering the City to pay refunds. The court held that the City had the authority to tax such earnings and that it had exercised that authority in its earnings tax ordinances. The trial court erred in holding that the City had no authority to collect earnings taxes on the plaintiffs' deferred compensation plans and in directing a refund to taxpayers for amounts collected after a certain date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the decedent's survivors, sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court, Jackson County (Missouri), which dismissed their wrongful death claim against respondents, the individual members of the Kansas City Board of Police Commissioners. The decedent's survivors contended that the Board violated its duty to exercise ordinary care and to protect the decedent by preventing him from accompanying officers to an active crime scene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's festival committee employed the decedent as the security director for its Italian festival. The city also required the festival committee to employ off-duty police officers to provide security for the festival. The decedent was fatally wounded when he left the festival grounds with off-duty police officers to investigate gunshots. The decedent's survivors contended that the Board violated its duty to exercise ordinary care towards the decedent and that it breached its duty under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 84.420 (1994) and under police guidelines and regulations when it failed to prevent him from accompanying the officers to an active crime scene. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment dismissing the wrongful death action filed by the decedent's survivors, finding that the Board's members were protected by sovereign immunity. The doctrine of sovereign immunity attached to the Board's operation and maintenance of the police force, and the city's purchase of liability insurance for the festival did not waive the Board's sovereign immunity under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 537.610 because the city and the Board were separate entities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff husband and wife appealed the judgment from the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which dismissed their petition against defendant priest, archbishop, and church. The petition was based on injuries allegedly suffered by plaintiff husband years earlier when he was sexually abused by defendant priest while attending a church school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on the statute of limitations, the trial court dismissed a petition by plaintiff husband and wife against defendants, priest, archbishop, and church. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. Plaintiff husband alleged that defendant priest sexually abused him when he was 13. Plaintiffs alleged that their claim did not accrue at the time of the abuse where the damage was not capable of ascertainment until October 1992, due to plaintiff husband's &quot;psychological coping mechanisms.&quot; Because the term could encompass involuntary repression of memory, the petition could withstand a motion to dismiss. However, the court had to affirm the dismissal if it could be sustained on another ground. The alleged acts of defendant priest clearly were not part of his duties as a priest or as a teacher. Thus, dismissal of the respondeat superior claim was proper. Religion was not merely incidental to plaintiff's relationship with defendants. Because U.S. Const. amend. I did not allow secular courts to judge sectarian matters, breach of fiduciary duty counts were not actionable. The loss of consortium action was properly dismissed for failure to state a claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A decision dismissing claims by plaintiff husband and wife for damages arising from alleged child sexual abuse by defendant priest was affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part. The court held that the statute of limitations did not bar suit, but no cause of action existed against defendant priest for breach of fiduciary duty or against defendant archbishop and church for respondeat superior.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughter was 29 years old when she filed her petition in June 1993 that alleged she was sexually abused by her father when she was between the ages of four and eight. The daughter did not recall the sexual abuse until she began therapy in November 1992. The trial court held the statute of limitations had run pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 537.046, a statute which provided a statute of limitations for suits based on childhood sexual abuse. Three months after the trial court decision, the Missouri Supreme Court decided a case that was similar to the daughter's case, and in reliance on that case, the court reversed. The supreme court noted that a petition could not be dismissed unless it clearly established that it was barred. The daughter argued that her action was based on assault and battery. The daughter argued that the assault and battery statute of limitations was tolled by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.100, which provided that a cause of action did not accrue until the damage was sustained and was capable of ascertainment. The court noted that the daughter's damage might not have been ascertainable until November 1992 and her petition might be timely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board enacted a section of the personnel manual, which required that all employees of the board be residents of the municipality within 90 days of being hired. The bargaining representative sought a declaratory judgment that the provision was unconstitutional, based on Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 40(30), and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The trial court granted the board's motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding the provision constitutional, and the bargaining representative appealed. On review the court noted that the provision did not apply to a geographical area and, thus, did not constitute a special law. The court found that the law applied to persons who would be the board's employees and applied to all of them equally. All persons were similarly situated. The court also noted that the provision did not restrict employment to local citizens; it just mandated residency. Finding that the board had the discretion to determine fitness and merit for employment, the court agreed with the trial court and affirmed its judgment.</SPAN></P>

He did not have liability insurance coverage either time. The Director acted on the second wreck first and then suspended the driver's license for one year pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 303.042.2(2), based on the prior suspension. The driver challenged both decisions and both were reversed. The Director argued that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to consider the 60-day suspension. The court agreed because the driver had not appealed the first decision within 30 days as required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 303.290.2. As to the Director's second decision, which suspended the driver's license for one year, the court found that the decision was correct because the driver had a prior suspension when the Director issued her order. It did not matter that the prior suspension was for an accident that occurred after the accident that gave rise to the Director's second suspension. Nothing in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 303.042 required the Director to act on alleged violations in chronological order.

Defendant and his wife purchased an insurance policy on the house. Thereafter, a fire took place in the early morning hours at his home. At the time of the fire, defendant was home alone. Defendant testified that he awoke around 1:30 a.m. and that when he opened the bedroom door, the hall filled with smoke. He returned to the bedroom, got dressed, went into the kitchen to retrieve three packs of cigarettes, then went outside through the front door. Defendant was charged by information with knowingly setting fire to his home. The jury convicted defendant of arson. The court affirmed and held that, although the trial court erred in submitting the voluntary intoxication instruction with the involuntary intoxication tail, which stated &quot;unless such condition was involuntarily produced,&quot; it was not prejudicial error. The involuntary intoxication tail had provided defendant with a potential defense.

The pharmacist sought a stay and contended that it was unjust to discipline him based on a federal conviction. The pharmacist sought a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pharmacist was convicted of a drug crime and related criminal activity. The Board then filed a complaint seeking a determination that the pharmacist was subject to discipline. The Board was granted summary judgment in its favor. The petition contended further that the pharmacist's rights were violated in federal court, he sought to introduce evidence surrounding the drug conviction, and he sought a declaration that the Board's actions were unconstitutional, arbitrary, and capricious. The circuit court dismissed the petition in its entirety even though the Board only filed a motion to dismiss the second count. The appellate court affirmed. The action was properly dismissed because, first, the circuit court did not have the power of equity or to make a declaratory judgment. Thus, a request that a declaration be made that the federal prosecution was biased and unreasonable was beyond the power of the circuit court. The second count was dismissed for the same reason. The circuit court could have dismissed the first count on its own because it did provide notice and an opportunity to be heard. Finally, there was no absolute right to judicial review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal of both counts of the pharmacist's petition was affirmed on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The injured party appealed the trial court's findings that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 537.610 was constitutional and that he was not entitled to prejudgment interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party lost control of his combine and suffered injury after he pulled it over to the shoulder to allow traffic to pass him. The shoulder gave way and he was flung from the combine. The injured party alleged that it was the negligent design, construction, and maintenance of the shoulder that caused his accident. The trial court reduced the jury damages to $ 100,000, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 537.610's cap on damages against the state. On appeal, the court found that the state supreme court had already determined that the cap on damages did not violate the state constitution. It also found that the injured party was not entitled to prejudgment interest that would increase his award above the cap. The court also ruled that the trial court did not err in failing to direct a verdict for the Commission because the shoulder was not, as a matter of law, an open an obvious hazard. Such a question was properly left for the jury. The court also found that there was ample evidence in the record to support the jury's verdict and the damage amount. The court also ruled that the trial court did not err in allowing lay opinion testimony from the injured party's friend.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff condemnor appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Callaway County (Missouri), which awarded defendant condemnee interest on a condemnation award from the date the Interstate Commerce Commission filed its report that taxed the court costs against the condemnor. The condemnor challenged the award of interest to the condemnee under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 523.045.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subject of the condemnation action was an 87.82-mile length of railroad track and right-of-way. First, the court held that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to proceed with the state eminent domain proceeding. The post-abandonment conditions that were contained in the Commission's exemption order did not have the effect of excluding state court jurisdiction in the state eminent domain proceedings. In addition, the language of &sect; 523.045 unequivocally required the payment of interest by the condemnor, as adjudged by the trial court, and left no room for interpretation. The statutory language was clear and unmistakable. The court stated that &sect; 523.045 was intended to compensate the condemnee for its loss of the ability to deal with its property freely. However, the court reversed the order that required the condemnor to post security for the payment of interest because it was beyond the trial court's authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agency issued orders against the father regarding child support arrearages allegedly owed by him under a 1967 judgment entered in Iowa. The circuit court subsequently reversed the agency's orders, finding that enforcement of Iowa judgment was barred by that state's 20-year statute of limitations. The court reversed the circuit court's judgment. Specifically, the court held that if the Iowa Supreme Court was called upon to address the issue, it would hold that the 20-year limitation period found in Iowa Code Ann. &sect; 614.1.6 (Supp. 1992) ran from the time each child support installment fell due.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The competitors obtained a certificate of need from MHFCR for the construction of a skilled nursing facility within a 15-mile radius of the facilities. The competitors then submitted to the MHFRC a request for a site change for the certificate of need. The new site was located immediately southwest of the facilities. The MHFRC approved the change without requiring the competitors to submit a new letter of intent, file a new application, or pay an additional filing fee. Instead of commenting on the proposed change at the scheduled hearing, the facilities sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The trial court awarded summary judgment in favor of respondents. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the facilities lacked standing pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.555 (1993 Supp.). Also, the facilities were not conferred standing based on status as taxpayers. The state funds utilized to pay MHFRC employees and to hold the MHFRC hearings and committee meetings were not the types of expenditures of public funds that conferred taxpayer standing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was driving a van at someone else's request. The van had been modified to hide marijuana. Defendant was stopped in Oklahoma because the van's alterations were obvious. However, no drugs were found and no drug-sniffing dog was available. The Oklahoma police alerted the Missouri police with instructions to stop the van if a dog were available. The Missouri police stopped the van, their dog alerted, and 45 bundles of marijuana were seized. The court reversed defendant's conviction, finding that the stop by the Missouri police violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. This was because it was based solely upon the Oklahoma trooper's hunch that the van might contain contraband. No new and independent behavior occurred that might have provided reasonable suspicion for the Missouri police. Consequently, no second stop was possible.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction and held that the evidence was sufficient to establish defendant's speed based on the finding that the police officer's radar unit was accurately gauging speed at the site of the violation at a reasonable proximity to the time when the radar gauged defendant's speed. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's untimely motion for a change of venue. Further, the court observed that nothing in the record suggested that defendant could not receive a fair trial by jury in the locale where the instant case was pending.

The Administrative Law Judge awarded permanent total disability compensation benefits and medical care but denied apportionment of liability between the employer and the Second Injury Fund (SIF), denied interest, and capped the employee's attorney's fees at $ 30,000. The Labor and Industrial Relations Commission affirmed the award and both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, a cardiovascular technician, suffered a back injury while reaching for a heavy carton above her head. She attempted to return to work but was unable to do so, and developed depression. The court reversed the determination that there was no SIF liability. The Commission was required to apply the amended Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.220, which provided that a preexisting permanent partial disability could induce SIF liability if it was serious enough to hinder reemployment. The court retreated from an earlier decision that the amendment was not retrospective, and decided that it was and should apply in this case. The court rejected the employee's claim that the attorney's fees limitation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.260 was unconstitutional under Mo. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 and art. V, &sect; 1, providing for separation of powers. Also, the employee lacked standing to raise the constitutional issues, because she had applied for attorney's fees under the statute and then, being dissatisfied with the award, contended that the statute was unconstitutional. The court held that interest on the award was available only from the date of the award under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.160.3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the award of the Labor and Industrial Relations Commission and remanded the case for a determination of whether, under Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father's marriage to the mother was dissolved, and the father was ordered to pay child support. A court in another state entered a Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA) order requiring the father to pay a different child support amount. The director of the division entered an administrative order, finding the father in arrears in paying child support and ordered him to commence payments towards the arrearage. The trial court denied the father's petition for review. On appeal, the court held that although Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.350.2 presumed the father's obligations to be paid 10 years after they became due, the father's motion to set aside or vacate the child support judgment revived his obligations. The court held that the father's payments in response to the URESA judgment against him were duly entered in the record for the purposes of maintaining his obligations under the divorce decree despite the fact that they were paid in another state. The court held that the judgment in the URESA action, even though it imposed a lesser support obligation, did not modify the father's obligation under the divorce decree.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician performed surgery on the patient's shoulder when the patient was 20 years old and treated the patient for a few months after the surgery. The patient filed a medical malpractice action for injuries arising out of the surgery on when she was 22, over two years after the surgery and her last treatment with the physician. Reversing the trial court judgment in favor of the patient, the court held that the action was barred by the two-year statute of limitations for negligence under &sect; 516.105. Contrary to the patient's argument, the statute of limitations was not tolled for her because she was no longer a minor under age 18 at the time the physician treated her. Additionally, although &sect; 516.105 had been held unconstitutional insofar as it applied to minors under age 18, its application to plaintiffs 18 and older remained intact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In seeking a declaration of paternity and an order for child support, medical insurance, and state debt, the mother claimed that the alleged father was the father of her child and that no judicial determination of paternity had been previously made. The child was 10 years old when the action was filed. The alleged father filed a motion to dismiss based on Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.826.1(2), which provided a five-year limitation for the purpose of declaring the nonexistence of a &quot;presumed father&quot; and child relationship. Otherwise, the limitation before the 1993 amendments was 18 years pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.828. The trial court granted the alleged father's motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court held that the trial court clearly erred in applying Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.826.1(2), a statutory provision that was no longer part of the governing statute when the mother filed her action. The alleged father based the affirmative defense on a statute of limitations provision that had been amended and was no longer in effect. Furthermore, the alleged father had failed to establish that he had a vested right in the five-year limitation under &sect; 210.826.1(2).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father filed an application with the Missouri Division of Family Services (Division) for food stamps. The application was approved as to the father and one of his children. However, the application was not approved as to another child because that child was receiving food stamps in his mother's household in another county. The Director of the Division (Director) upheld the denial based on the Division's written administrative procedure that precluded an otherwise eligible member of a food stamp household from being included unless the individual was in the household for more than 50 percent of his meals. The Director's decision was affirmed by the trial court despite the father's allegation he had been deprived of his due process rights when the Director denied him the opportunity to present evidence demonstrating facts of the discriminatory effects of the Division's rules. The trial court's judgment was reversed on appeal and remanded for further proceedings because the trial court was found to have abused its discretion when it ruled on the father's constitutional challenge to the Division's regulations without conducting an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

The subsequent breathalyzer test revealed that the driver had a blood alcohol content of 0.204 percent. The Director affirmed the suspension of the driver's license. After a trial de novo before the circuit court, the circuit court found for the driver because the Director was unable to describe the method used in stopping cars at the checkpoint. In reversing, the court held that the revocation procedures of &sect;&sect; 302.500-302.540 did not require the Director to show that the stop was lawful or based upon probable cause. Rather, the court stated that the Director was required to prove only that the driver was arrested upon probable cause that he was driving in violation of an alcohol-related offense and that the driver had been driving at a time when his blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit. Since these two requirements were met, the court held that the driver's privileges were properly suspended.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.140 (1986). The incest survivor relied on Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 537.046 (Cum. Supp. 1990), childhood sexual abuse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The incest survivor contented that her father had sexually abused her from ages three to seven. She was 28 when she filed the complaint. She alleged an &quot;involuntarily repressed conscious memory&quot; to explain why she delayed filing the petition as long as 25 years after a sexual touching at age three. The father filed a motion to dismiss the petition on the ground that the petition was barred by &sect; 516.140, the statute of limitations for battery. The trial court granted the motion. The court reversed. Sexual abuse was not exclusively or inherently a claim for battery. The petition also could have supported proof of a claim for negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress, each of which had a five-year statute of limitations. The statute of limitations began to run when the incest survivor first recalled the identity of the abuser. Thus, her petition was timely filed because of the extension of statute of limitations set forth in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 537.046. The incest survivor's cause of action was within the extended three-year statute of limitations in &sect; 537.046. A limitation period could be extended by a new statute for existing claims not barred by previous statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

Defendant offered an accomplice the use of a utility knife, which they decided was insufficient to the task. Defendant then found a larger knife and accompanied his brothers to the house, where they killed the victim and stole personal effects. Defendant was charged and convicted of the murder. The trial court denied post-conviction relief. The court affirmed the conviction and the denial of the post-conviction relief, holding that admission of photographs of the victim's body and of the crime scene was relevant to show the location and nature of the wounds, clarify witness testimony, and establish elements of the crime. The photographs helped establish cause of death, defendant's intent, and his liability as an accomplice. Seizure of the utility knife taken from defendant's car did not violate defendant's constitutional rights because defendant did not seek to suppress the evidence. Further, the utility knife was admissible under the inevitable discovery rule because the officers would have obtained a search warrant based on the statements of an accomplice.</SPAN></P>

The officer appealed again, and the court reviewed the decision of the state police. The court held that the state police had not acted outside its authority in dismissing the officer.

The mother requested that the petition be dismissed on the basis that the matter had already been adjudicated administratively and that the father had failed to file a petition for review. The court denied the mother's motion. The mother asserted on appeal that the trial court erred in overruling her motion to dismiss because the father failed to exhaust his administrative remedies by failing to file a petition for judicial review. Therefore, the mother argued that the father's cause of action should have been barred because of his failure to proceed under the administrative statutory scheme. The court agreed. The administrative decision became a final judgment upon the filing of the decision with the circuit court. The court held that the trial court had no jurisdiction over the father's action and its ruling was a nullity.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that the trial court appropriately ordered a refund of the increased charges because the voters paid the taxes involuntarily. Because the taxes were paid involuntarily, sovereign immunity did not protect the sewer district from the action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the deed of trust was executed and recorded well before the association's common expense assessments became a lien on the units included in the deed of trust. The association contended that an old version of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 448.080 applied, which stated that a prior recorded deed of trust was not entitled to the priority accorded to it by &sect; 448.080 because it did not contain a Missouri mailing address for the encumbrancer. The deed holder contended that &sect; 448.080 did not apply, but the priority of its deed of trust was governed by &sect; 448.3-116.2(2) of a newly enacted law. Section 448.3-116.2(2) did not require a Missouri mailing address of the encumbrancer to be stated in the encumbrance in order for the encumbrance to have priority. Section 448.3-116.2(2) gave priority to a mortgage and deed of trust for the purchase of a unit recorded before the date on which the assessment sought to be enforced became delinquent. The court held that the old law applied because, as a matter of law, parties were deemed to enter into their contracts in contemplation of the law as it existed at the time. Thus, the deed was not entitled to priority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the decision of the trial court, which determined that the condominium association's lien was superior to the deed holder's deed in trust.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 408.500 (1990).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 408.500 provided that certain lenders should file their rate schedules with the director, who would approve the rates that were comparable with those lawfully charged in the marketplace for similar loans. The statute further provided that in determining the marketplace, the director should consider the appropriateness of rate requests made in the states contiguous to Missouri. The proposed rate submitted by the corporation was based on that charged in one of the contiguous states. The corporations contended inter alia that the lower court erred in upholding the denial because the director had no discretion to deny rates, and erred in finding that the director's decision was not arbitrary. The court held that the director's determination was arbitrary. The court held that: (1) the term &quot;appropriateness&quot; as used in &sect; 408.500 contemplated some measure of discretion; and (2) the &quot;affordability&quot; and &quot;profitability&quot; factors used by the director in determining the proposed rate were applied in an arbitrary manner because there was no evidence that people could not afford the proposed rates and there was no evidence of the companies' profit margin.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents owned crusher rock on a parcel of condemned land. After a damage award was deposited into the trial court registry to compensate the owner of the condemned land, respondents sought a portion of the award to compensate them for the taking of their rock. MHTC asserted that the rock was part of the real property and that it had also obtained rights to use the rock atop the land. The trial court refused to apportion the damage award, but ruled that the rock was respondents' personal property. Respondents then filed a petition for inverse condemnation in the same trial court. The court upheld the award for respondents in their inverse condemnation action. The court held that MHTC was collaterally estopped from relitigating the ownership of the rock and that MHTC had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the earlier condemnation proceedings. In particular, MHTC had a strong incentive to litigate the issue of ownership of the rock to avoid the inverse condemnation action. Finally, MHTC failed to preserve its claims of error based upon failure to exhaust administrative remedies because it failed to refer the court to the relevant administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility sought to install transmission lines; however, the cost to do so underground, as required by the city code, was substantial.

The lines traversed the property owners' land, which was condemned. The property owners sought a declaration that the ordinances were unconstitutional special legislation adopted in violation of the city's established procedures. Summary judgment was granted to the city and the utility, and the court affirmed on appeal. The court held that the ordinances were validly and properly enacted. The ordinances were clearly special legislation because they applied only to the utility. Special legislation was presumed unconstitutional; however, the circumstances were unique such that general legislation would have been inappropriate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department banned commercial fishing on the lake on the grounds that the lake constituted the &quot;waters of the state&quot; under Mo.

The trust ultimately sold the lake, at a profit, to the Department and then later filed an action for inverse condemnation alleging the ban deprived the trust of all economic use of the property. The court affirmed the trial court's decision in favor of the Department and found that (1) where the lake was not at all times totally enclosed in a single ownership and was subject to the &quot;movement of fishes&quot; between the lake and other water bodies, the lake was properly classified as the &quot;waters of the state;&quot; (2) The &quot;movement of fishes&quot; language in &sect; 10-11.805(39) was not unconstitutionally vague where the trustee had constructive notice of the regulation and all the information necessary to determine if the lake was subject to the regulation; (3) the regulation served the State's legitimate interest in protecting its natural resources; and (4) there was no evidence that the regulation denied the trust all economic use of the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction on the ground that the trial court's denial of defendant's challenge for cause of a prospective juror, who stated she would not have been able to hear the evidence in the case because of its gory details, denied defendant a fair trial in violation of his rights under U.S. Const. amends. V, VI, XIV, and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 10 and 18(a). Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion for relief from his conviction on the ground that defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel because defendant's attorney abandoned the defense of mental disease or defect. The court found that the prospective juror's responses to all of the questions posed in voir dire showed that the prospective juror could effectively consider all of the evidence regardless of its gore, that the trial court properly found that the psychological exams given to defendant were not deficient, that the exam results showed that defendant did not suffer from any mental defect, and that defendant's attorney's strategy choice to abandon the defense did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision by the Circuit Court of Vernon County (Missouri), which convicted defendant of assault of a law enforcement officer in the third degree, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.083 (Supp. 1990). The trial court sentenced defendant to a 120-day term of confinement in the county jail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that there was a fatal variance between the crime charged in the information and the crime, which he was found guilty of committing. He also claimed that the provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.083.1(5), which pertained to when a person might have committed the crime of third-degree assault of a law enforcement officer, were unconstitutionally vague. The court stated that defendant failed to demonstrate how his ability to adequately prepare a defense was prejudiced by the variance between the information and the trial court's verdict with respect to the various methods of committing assault on a law enforcement officer. The court held that a person to whom a statute might constitutionally have been applied would not be heard to challenge the facial validity of that statute on the ground that it might conceivably have been applied unconstitutionally to others, in situations not before the court. Defendant might not have espoused the cause of differently situated persons as a defense in a prosecution where the statute clearly applied to him. Defendant had failed to provide argument showing how &sect; 565.083.1(5) was unconstitutionally vague as applied to his own conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City argued that in the event the court decided that there was a conflict between Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89.060 and &sect; 11.18 of the City Charter so as to prohibit protest petitions by owners of less than 30 percent of the qualifying property, &sect; 89.060 was inapplicable because it was superseded by Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 22 to the extent that it purported to set the extent of the majority required to approve a zoning change after the filing of a protest. Even if the court had jurisdiction to declare that the portion of &sect; 89.060 requiring approval by two-thirds of the council was invalid because of a constitutional provision, it would have been incumbent on the City, in urging that position, to demonstrate that the provision was not severable from the statute's requirement that there first be a protest by owners of at least 30 percent of the qualifying property. There was nothing before the court to indicate that the City presented this issue to the trial court for its determination. Having failed to do so, it was not permitted to raise it for the first time on appeal, much less after the opinion of this court had been issued.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which upon a jury verdict convicted defendant of one count of burglary in the first degree and one count of making a false declaration, a misdemeanor. The court overruled defendant's general motion to have six jurors excluded from the case who had been victims of burglaries or were related to burglary victims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainant arose one morning, found his wallet, which he had put on his dresser, lying on the kitchen table, and noticed that his cash was missing. Hearing a noise in the basement, he investigated and found defendant hiding behind some hanging clothes. He called the police. Twenty-four of the 41 persons on the venire panel had been victims of burglaries or were related to victims. Six of those 24 were seated on the jury. Affirming defendant's conviction and sentence, the court held that she opened the door to questioning by the State about her prior convictions when she testified on direct examination that she could not recall any details of her prior convictions. The court found that defendant's general objection to the prosecutor's remarks during closing argument was not sufficiently specific to apprise the trial court of the grounds for the objection and, therefore, she failed to preserve the error for review. The court found no plain error. The court determined that the six challenged venirepersons unequivocally indicated their ability to evaluate the evidence in a fair and impartial manner and that defendant could not challenge the venire panel for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff truck owners leased trucks to defendant trucking company, which provided that plaintiff would supply the fuel. Defendant later made an agreement with an oil company which would give it rebates if defendant purchase its gasoline. Defendant took the proposal to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs agreed because they thought that they would lose the lease if they denied the request. Upon discovery of the underlying rebate agreement, plaintiffs brought an action for damages, breach of contract, fraud, and fraudulent non-disclosure. A jury found for plaintiffs and awarded them $ 4.2 million in punitive damages. The trial court sustained a remittitur on the punitive award and entered a total punitive judgment of $ 350,000. Both sides appealed from the judgment. The court held that defendant wrongfully terminated their lease after they promised to amend it to give a longer cancellation period. The court held that defendant were barred by promissory estoppel from terminating their lease. The award of damages as a result of the rebate kickbacks to defendant properly represented the loss of bargain to plaintiffs. The trial judge's granting of remittitur was not plain error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Missouri Director of Revenue and the Missouri Department of Revenue, sought review of the peremptory writ of mandamus issued by the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri) ordering them to perform their statutory functions incident to the administration of the Capital Improvements Sales Tax enacted by respondent city under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 94.577, as that statute was construed in the trial court order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city adopted an ordinance establishing a one-half of one percent sales tax on all retail sales made in the city for the purpose of funding capital improvements. The tax was to become effective upon a majority vote of the qualified city voters. The city submitted to the City of Crestwood Board of Election Commissioners a certification of the propositions upon which to be voted, including the proposal for the tax. The City notified counsel for the Board that the tax proposition was authorized by its interpretation of &sect; 94.577. In the Board's declaratory judgment action, the exclusionary language of &sect; 94.577 was held unconstitutional and severable. The Board was directed to place the proposition on the ballot. The proposition was approved. The city made demand upon appellants to administer the tax. The trial court issued a peremptory writ of mandamus for the city, adopting the prior trial court order to the effect that the exclusionary language was unconstitutional. The court reversed, finding that the city could not directly attack the constitutionality of &sect; 94.577 by way of a mandamus proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment issuing a peremptory writ of mandamus for the city. The court remanded the action for the trial court to enter an order quashing the writ. Since constitutionality of the statute could not be directly attacked by the city by way of mandamus, it was not necessary to decide whether the trial court made an independent finding in regard to constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

As to the postconviction appeal, the court held (1) defendant was not entitled to appellate review of his claim of trial court error both on direct appeal and in his postconviction proceeding, and (2) defendant could not prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because he failed to show that his trial lawyer's deficient performance prejudiced him.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 448.1-102, 448.3-116 (1983). With respect to the lien for delinquent common expenses, &sect; 448.3-116 superseded Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 448.080 (1986), of the Missouri Condominium Property Act. The Condominium Act prevailed over any provisions of the declaration or by-laws of the association, which were inconsistent with it. However, the position of the deeds of trust in relation to the common expenses lien was governed by the Property Act, which was in effect when they were executed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 569.020 and 571.015. Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his request for a mistrial based upon the state's failure to disclose that a rebuttal witness previously identified defendant as one of the armed robbers. The court ruled that whether the state violated the rules of discovery rested within the sound discretion of the trial court. Further, the court held that declaring a mistrial was a drastic remedy and was employed only in the most extraordinary circumstances. Also, the court found that the denial of a requested sanction was an abuse of discretion only where the admission of evidence or testimony resulted in a fundamental unfairness to defendant. The court affirmed the judgment convicting defendant, concluding that the admission of the testimony was in error, but that there was no abuse of discretion because admitting the evidence resulted in no fundamental unfairness to defendant.</SPAN></P>

She declined to exhaust her administrative remedies before filing suit. The trial court granted the ex-employer's motion for summary judgment and the ex-employee appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that because the ex-employee accepted the one-year extension of employment without tenure and did not pursue her grievance any further through the grievance process, she was barred from bringing suit alleging that she was wrongfully denied tenure. The ex-employee's constitutional challenge to the tenure provisions did not excuse her from the exhaustion requirement because she did not argue that the alleged constitutional flaws in the tenure provisions automatically precluded her from receiving tenure.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father's daughter was born out of wedlock. She was placed in foster care with the Missouri Division of Family Services due to allegations of physical abuse. The father pled guilty to two counts of rape of his two minor sisters. The father was required to go through the Missouri Sexual Offender Program (MOSOP) pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 589.040, but was dismissed from the program because of a disciplinary violation. The Juvenile Officer of the Juvenile Division filed a petition to terminate the father's parental rights and the trial court granted the petition. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court held that the statute involved focused on specified prior conduct which was indicative of a propensity to abuse children and thus subjects the parent to forfeiture of parental rights to other children, regardless of whether such children have previously been specific targets of abuse. The court noted that the inference of such propensity is particularly strong in cases of incest because the parent by his actions has demonstrated that the natural, moral constraint of blood relationship has failed to prevent deviant conduct.</SPAN></P>

The county amended its zoning ordinance, which brought the city's airport within property considered to be flood plains. The city received a conditional permit to continue operation of the airport, but the permit prohibited any future expansions or improvements. The city sought to expand its airport and brought an action against the county, claiming that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 305.200 gave it the power of condemnation to acquire property for its expansion, making the zoning ordinance inapplicable, and alleging that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional. The city moved for summary judgment on the counts and the trial court granted summary judgment on the claim that the ordinance was inapplicable. On appeal, the court held that the city's eminent domain power to develop an airport did not extend to property located outside its corporate boundaries, which prevented the city from being immune to the county's zoning ordinance. The court found that the city was estopped from challenging the applicability of the ordinance because it had previously used the benefits of its conditional permit.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced the defendant to seven years' imprisonment after finding that he was a prior and persistent offender. The court affirmed the defendant's conviction. The trial court did not err in admitting into evidence the marijuana that was seized from the vehicle in which the defendant was a passenger because the police officer's stop of the vehicle was based on a reasonable suspicion that the defendant was involved in criminal activity. In addition, the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of possession of less than 35 grams of marijuana under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.202.3. The defendant was not entitled to a lesser included offense instruction merely because the jury might have disbelieved some of the state's evidence or declined to draw some or all of the permissible inferences.

The court first held that, because it found defendant's constitutional claim merely colorable and not substantial, it had jurisdiction to consider his claim that &sect; 566.010(1) lacked sufficient clarity to provide notice of the type of conduct that was punishable. The statute was sufficiently specific to provide fair warning that defendant's actions were within the conduct that was prohibited and the statute's definition of deviate sexual intercourse had been held not to be unconstitutionally vague. Further, testimony that defendant had touched one of the girl's vaginal area, even if uncorroborated, was sufficient to sustain the conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the adoptive father's conviction and incarceration for sexually molesting the child, she filed this negligence against her adoptive father and her mother. The adoptive father and mother took a summary judgment in the trial court upon the bases of parental immunity and the statute of limitations. The child appealed and secured partial relief. The trial court's award of summary judgment underwent de novo review on appeal. The doctrine of parental immunity was to be applied only when it was concluded that to hold otherwise would seriously disturb the family relations and thus be contrary to public policy. An exception to the doctrine was recognized for suits against a parent for failing to protect the child from sexual abuse, as well as against the parent perpetrating the abuse. In light of the adoptive father's conviction and incarceration for the rape of the child, she was entitled to a summary judgment against her adoptive father. An evidentiary hearing was necessary to ascertain how family harmony would be affected by permitting the child's negligence action against her mother. The child's suit was timely under Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation owned business space that was rented to small businesses. The ordinance charged fees to all businesses within 300 feet of a sewer line, except for those that could not attach to the sewer. The funds were used to pay revenue bonds issued to construct the sewer system and for sewer maintenance and operation. Appellants claimed that the fees violated Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 22(a), because they were levied and increased without a public vote. The appellate court held that there was no constitutional violation. The charges were clearly user fees, not a fee masquerading as a tax. The ordinance specifically dedicated the fees to limited purposes rather than general city expenditures. City voters had approved the sewer bond ordinance, which obligated the city to collect adequate charges to pay the bonds and maintain the system. Appellants also claimed that it was unlawful to charge the corporation's tenants even though they were not connected to the system, but the appellate court found that the benefit to the land conferred by sewer accessibility supported the fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ward's mother had previously signed papers requesting that he be committed to a mental health facility for observation and evaluation due to his strange behavior. He believed that the Mafia was in control of the city. His mother obtained audio tapes and letters in a returned package that were addressed to news media organizations, broadcasting schools, and a celebrity about crime in the city, which asked that they get &quot;in touch&quot; with a certain director in Hollywood about his work on the communication systems of the State of United Nations. Pursuant to the administrator's petition, a jury found him incapacitated and disabled. He appealed, and the court affirmed. The court rejected the ward's argument that the letters and tapes were inadmissible because they were illegally obtained by his mother. The Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures was implicated by governmental, not private, action. In civil actions, the manner in which evidence was obtained was irrelevant to admissibility. Because a prima facie case was established, the ward's physician could be compelled to testify pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 475.075.6.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The small village, consisting solely of 80 homes on 80 lots, had only one zoning ordinance that zoned all land in the village as single family residential property. The landowners requested rezoning of their property for commercial purposes. When the village refused, the landowners brought suit. The trial court granted summary judgment to the landowners, finding that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional and infirm because the village had no comprehensive land use plan as required by state law. However, the trial court declined to rule on the landowners' request for attorney fees. The village sought review and the landowners cross-appealed. On appeal, the court held that the village's ordinance was valid and that, in such a small community, it could also be treated as a &quot;comprehensive plan&quot; under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89.040. The court also held that the zoning regulation calling for residential use was facially reasonable in such a small bedroom community.</SPAN></P>

After filing the report, the candidate sought to have his name reinstated on the ballot. However, the deadline for filing passed. The candidate then filed a petition to reinstate himself on the ballot. After the trial court dismissed his petition and lifted a stay against the secretary of state, the candidate sought review. Specifically, he contended that &sect; 130.071.2 violated Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 4. He also raised other constitutional issues. In affirming, the court determined that the candidate failed to preserve his constitutional issues involving the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2, 10. Moreover, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 130.071.2 did not impose an unconstitutional eligibility requirement on the candidate.

The employee alleged he was living in his uncle's home within the city. When the Board found his separation from his wife was a mere subterfuge, the employee filed a federal discrimination claim. The federal court held that the residency requirement, as applied to married officers, violated the equal protection clause and it directed that, in determining the place where the employee resided, the Board could only consider factors that related to the employee's residence, not his wife's. The Board was bound by that order. Looking at a series of factors, the Board determined that the employee was actually residing with his wife outside the city. On review, the court held that fact fining rested with the Board, and if the evidence warranted either of two opposed findings, the court was required to uphold the decision of the Board. To establish a new residence, the employee had to show both actual personal presence in the new place and an intention to remain there.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stipulated that he drove on the streets of Cape Girardeau with a loaded .32-caliber pistol. He was charged and found guilty of a violation &sect; 17-98(a)(5). He declined a suspended sentence and was fined $ 50. Defendant then asserted a constitutional challenge to the validity of &sect; 17-98(a)(5) in which he contended that the ordinance contravened Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. The city maintained that the ordinance was authorized by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 21.750 (1986). On appeal, the court held that the Missouri Constitution, in declaring that every citizen had the right to bear arms in defense of himself and the State, neither expressly nor by implication denied to the legislature the right to enact laws in regard to the manner in which arms were borne. The court noted Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 23 expressly limited the right to the defense of home, person, or property. The court opined that defendant failed to meet his burden of injecting the issue of justification in defense of person, premises, or property in his claim. The court found that the proscription of the ordinance did not prohibit the open carrying of all firearms, but only those readily capable of lethal use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant public employee challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri), which, as summary judgment, granted the motion to dismiss filed by the Missouri State Employees' Retirement System (MOSERS). The employee brought the action after MOSERS denied his appeal from the refusal of his request for retroactive payment of retirement benefits for the time period after he turned 60 but before he retired.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee served as a state representative from January 1957 through January 1963, and he served as a circuit judge from December 1972 through August 31, 1992. In 1987 he applied to MOSERS for retirement benefits to commence on his 60th birthday, based on his age and service as a state representative. He argued that the statutory scheme permitted such benefits. On appeal, the court disagreed. The court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 104.370.2 (1992) and its forerunners back to 1967 prohibited a former legislator at or after normal retirement age from &quot;double dipping&quot; by receiving legislator retirement benefits for any period during which he was serving in appointive state office. The employee was, therefore, ineligible to receive any retirement benefits until after he resigned as circuit judge. The court rejected his equal protection claims because they were based on speculation as to the legal basis for MOSERS' denial of the benefits. Because he was not entitled to benefits for the period in question, he was not deprived of property, with or without due process of law, and he had no property that could have been taken from him without just compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that granted summary judgment to MOSERS.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was committed to the department of mental health, after he was found not guilty of rape by reason of mental disease or defect excluding responsibility.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the denial of his request violated due process of law, as he claimed the State had the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he was both mentally ill and dangerous, but no such evidence was presented at the hearing on his application. Therefore his constitutional right to due process was infringed, as the trial court, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 552.040.6(6), placed the burden of persuasion on him rather than on the State. The appellate court rejected defendant's argument. The issue raised by defendant was decided adversely to defendant's position by the Missouri Supreme Court in Tooley v. State. Further, defendant did not preserve his constitutional challenge, as he failed to specifically raise it at the earliest available opportunity, as required by case law.</SPAN></P>

Defendants argued that the State failed to prove that each entered a building unlawfully. The court upheld the convictions. The health center was a private physician's office that was open to the public for a limited purpose of treating patients. The office contained a waiting room and a restricted area connected by a reception window and the security door.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which granted appellee county's motion for summary judgment. The property owners contended that county officials wrongfully refused to classify two apartment complexes as condominium residences for tax purposes, as city officials had not approved the reclassification. The property owners asserted constitutional violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners recorded a plat and a declaration announcing a reclassification of their apartments as condominiums. Because city officials declined approval of the plat, county tax officials refused to accept the declaration and continued taxing the property at the commercial rate. Reclassifying the property as condominiums would have reduced the tax rate significantly. The property owners paid the assessed taxes under protest, but appealed the issue to the county board of equalization. The board denied the claim, and the property owners appealed the matter to the state tax commission, and, before obtaining a ruling from the commission, they initiated the lawsuit. The appellate court held that, as the property owners took their dispute to the circuit court rather than to the state tax commission, the trial court did not have jurisdiction. Also, lawsuits involving tax collection were an exception to the general rule that a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 plaintiff was not required to exhaust state remedies.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced defendant as a prior and persistent offender and prior drug offender to 20 years' imprisonment. Defendant filed a Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.15 motion for post-conviction review. The Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri) denied the motion. In a consolidated appeal, defendant directly appealed his conviction and appealed from the denial of his motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court abused its discretion by striking for cause a venireperson because he did not intentionally fail to disclose a prior arrest. In upholding the trial court's decision, the appellate court noted that it was not an unmistakable abuse of discretion for the trial court to believe the venireperson realized he had been arrested when he knew charges were pending against him, he turned himself into the police, he was booked and fingerprinted, and then was released on his own recognizance. Defendant also argued that the trial court plainly erred in allowing the State to improperly personalize the crime to the jurors in its closing argument. The appellate court found no error, noting that the prosecutor's remarks were within the allowable limits. Finally, defendant argued that the denial of his motion for postconviction review without an evidentiary hearing was in error because the indictment against him was fatally defective in that it designated his crime as a Class A felony not Class B felony. The appellate court determined that the error was not fatal since the statute defining the crime was properly set forth and defendant was correctly sentenced.</SPAN></P>

However, the student alleged sufficient facts to support her claims that the college attempted to stifle her constitutionally protected right to free speech. The college was created under state statutes and the alleged constitutional deprivations by the college were governmental acts done under color of law and viable &sect; 1983 claims. The count was properly dismissed as it related to a due process issue. Also, the Act protected the student's rights. She properly exhausted all of her administrative remedies in seeking review and injunctive relief from a final decision about her suspension.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff real estate developer sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court, St. Louis County (Missouri), which entered summary judgment in favor of defendant sewer district. The trial court concluded as a matter of law that the sewer district was empowered to enforce its sewer charges with a lien that had priority over prerecorded deeds of trust. The real estate developer contended that the trial court's judgment was erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The real estate developer's deeds of trust were recorded before Mo. Rev.

The court found that the sewer district had the authority to enact ordinances to enforce collection of delinquent sewer service charges by imposing liens on the real estate serviced. However, the sewer district did not have the power to enact an ordinance that gave its liens priority over prerecorded deeds of trust. Only the legislature had the power to change the priorities of liens and to give a statutory lien priority over other liens. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment finding that the sewer district had the power to impose liens for delinquent sewer service charges, but it reversed the remainder of its judgment in favor of the sewer district and remanded. No Missouri statute gave the sewer district's sewer liens priority over deeds of trust when the real estate developer's deeds of trust were recorded, and the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the sewer district on the issue lien priority.</SPAN></P>

An administrative law judge entered a temporary or partial award, finding that some symptoms were caused by the work accident and others were not. The employer/insurer filed an application for review, which was dismissed by the Labor and Industrial Relations Commission (Missouri). The employer/insurer appealed. The claimant requested sanctions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reviewing court found that the administrative law judge (ALJ) made a temporary or partial award, leaving open the extent of permanent partial disability. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.510 (1986) provided for temporary or partial awards that remained open. Decisions appealable in workers' compensation proceedings were only those expressly declared to be appealable by statute. There was no statutory authorization to appeal orders dismissing applications for review of temporary or partial awards. The dismissal order in the instant case was not a final order, as it did not completely resolve the case before it. The matter was still pending before the ALJ until a final award could be made. The employer challenged the constitutionality of Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 8, &sect; 20-3.040, arguing that it was prevented from meaningful judicial review. The employer argued that it either had to refuse to pay, and be subject to penalties, or pay without any realistic opportunity for recoupment, if the decision were ultimately reversed. The reviewing court declined to review the constitutional challenge, in the absence of jurisdiction and a fully developed record.</SPAN></P>

The corporate taxpayer sought a refund and prejudgment interest. The trial court granted summary judgment for the city on the corporate taxpayer's suit. The corporate taxpayer appealed. In reversing the grant of summary judgment, the court held that, as applied to the corporate taxpayer, the city's occupation license tax was unconstitutional and in violation of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution because the tax was not limited in its application to manufacturing that occurred within the city. However, the court held that the corporate taxpayer failed to plead a cause of action for a refund of the unconstitutional tax. The court exercised its discretion to give the corporate taxpayer an opportunity to amend its complaint to state such a cause of action because the corporate taxpayer demonstrated a state of facts upon which it might be able to recover if the case were properly pled.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing defendant's request to submit a jury instruction on the lawful defense of another. The court observed that the evidence suggested that only a dispute between defendant and her husband existed and that at the moment of the shooting she had no reason to believe that her son was in immediate danger. As a probation officer's testimony both contradicted defendant's testimony that her husband physically abused her and was relevant to the issue of self-defense, no foundation was necessary for the State to offer this testimony. Regardless of whether or not the testimony of a probation officer was privileged, the testimony was not unfairly prejudicial as it was simply cumulative to the testimony of abuse offered by defendant at an earlier probation hearing. The admission of rebuttal testimony as to defendant's enrollment and application status at a college was within the discretion of the trial court. The Mo. Approved Instructions-Crim. 3d 302.04 were previously found constitutional by the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>

The State asserted that the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction by precluding the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder. Defendant was 16 years of age. The State alleged that defendant and four co-participants raped the victim before defendant shot her in the head to keep her from identifying them. The State did not charge three of the youths with any offense in connection with the incident. The State charged another alleged co-participant with first-degree murder, but dropped the charge. Defendant asserted that the State dropped the charge in return for the co-participant's testimony against defendant. The State filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty. Defendant filed three motions: two asking the court to quash the State's notice of intent to prove aggravating circumstances and a third asking the court to preclude the State from seeking the death penalty due to disproportionality in sentencing. The trial court denied defendant's motion to quash the notice of intent but sustained the motion to precluded the State from seeking the death penalty due to disproportionality in sentencing. The court reversed, holding that defendant's age and the State's lack of punishment of the co-participants were not a proper basis for finding of disproportionality.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the court ordered the trial court to set aside its ruling prohibiting the State from seeking the death penalty against defendant. The court also denied defendant's request for a writ of prohibition or mandamus.</SPAN></P>

The authority sought a judgment that it had satisfied the requirements of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 65.665 (Supp. 1990) for overruling the disapproval of its landfill proposal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the commission had denied the authority's application, the authority filed a request for rehearing and notice of appeal directed to the board of zoning adjustment, which were later withdrawn. The authority's application for an operating permit was denied by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, Solid Waste Management Program (DNR). On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. Because the authority was not appealing the commission's decision but challenging the validity of zoning regulations, the court held a declaratory judgment action was proper to determine its rights under &sect; 65.665. An appeal to the board was not required under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 65.690(1) and (2) because the action was not an appeal of the commission's decision and the matter was not referred to the board by the commission. However, the court remanded for further proceedings as insufficient evidence existed to make a determination regarding whether or not the authority failed to appeal the DNR's denial of its state permit pursuant to Mo.

The association filed an action against the city and the manger seeking a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was unconstitutional and a permanent injunction against enforcement of the ordinance.

Defendant was sentenced, pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, to imprisonment for 10 years. He later filed an amended motion for reduction of sentence under the plain error rule, Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.12(B). The Circuit Court of Greene County (Missouri) denied the motion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to reduce his sentence, as the sentence imposed was in violation of Missouri laws in effect at the time the sentence was imposed. At the time he was sentenced, the maximum penalty for transporting marijuana was a term of imprisonment for not more than five years. The appellate court held that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to grant the relief sought under the guise of Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.12, as that rule did not empower the trial court to enter a new and different judgment. It applied to corrections of clerical mistakes. Defendant requested the trial court enter a new judgment, not to correct a clerical mistake. The applicable rule for the relief defendant sought was Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 24.035, which provided for relief from a sentence imposed that was in excess of the maximum sentence authorized. Relief under Rule 24.035 had to be requested within 90 days or resulted in a complete waiver of any right to proceed under that rule. Defendant failed to avail himself of the proper remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney and ex-shareholder were co-owners of a legal corporation that undertook representation of the employee in his workers' compensation matter. The ex-shareholder negotiated a settlement and thereafter the corporation allegedly dissolved. The attorney completed the representation of the employee. The attorney was granted a 20 percent fee, and the ex-shareholder appeared before the division and asserted a lien against the proceeds of 25 percent and a deposition fee. An administrative law judge awarded a 25 percent fee and divided the fee between the attorney and ex-shareholder. The Commission affirmed the order. The attorney challenged the decision, and the court reversed and remanded. The ex-shareholder was not personally entitled to an attorney fee award because he did not have a contract with the employee. Only the legal corporation had a contract with the employee. Additionally, two different fee awards were made and the discrepancy had to be resolved. Finally, the Commission had no authority to determine issues regarding the dissolution of the corporation and splitting of the fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed an action seeking to recover city occupational license taxes on the basis that the taxes that were assessed were illegal. The trial court granted a summary judgment in favor of the city. Upon review, the court reversed. The court found that it had jurisdiction to decide the case where Mo. Rev. Code &sect; 139.031 applied to county collectors but not city collectors and there was no constitutional claim within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Missouri Supreme Court. The court determined that the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, was not violated by the city occupational taxes at issue where the ordinance did not discriminate against interstate commerce and was internally consistent. The court concluded the provision of the city's occupation license tax applicable to manufacturers was unconstitutional as applied to appellant because the tax was not limited in its application to manufacturing that occurred within the city. The court reasoned that the assembly of component parts into completed automobiles was not a manufacturing process that was conducted entirely within the city and the value for such parts should have been excluded from gross receipts.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 565.004 (1978) second-degree murder, sentenced him to 10 years in prison, and, after an evidentiary hearing, denied his Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.15 postconviction relief motion. The appeals court consolidated defendant's two appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was babysitting a baby and a young girl (defendant's and his girlfriend's daughters). The girlfriend's older daughter then came home from a paper route. The girlfriend then came home from work and reported to police that the baby was moaning, groaning, and appearing lifeless. The medical records indicated small bruises to the baby's nose, left ear lobe, and stomach, and later the baby was found to have a torus fracture of the right wrist, edema of the head (swelling of the brain), and a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The baby was on life support and later died. Defendant was charged in 1982 with murder (shaken baby syndrome) and arrested, jumped bond, and was rearrested eight years later. There was sufficient circumstantial evidence to convict. Conviction could have been based solely on circumstantial evidence. Defendant said he dropped the baby during her bath, and, later, that he covered up for other family members. Expert evidence indicated the bath fall did not cause the injuries. Defendant admitted the young girl could not cause the injuries. Defendant's size, being alone with the baby, flight, alias, and not speaking up earlier were circumstantial evidence of guilt.</SPAN></P>

He was convicted of second-degree murder, armed criminal action, and unlawful use of a weapon, and sentenced. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence, finding that the erroneous date in the instruction for unlawful use of a weapon, when considered with all the instructions given, did not mislead the jury as to the date of the offense charged and did not prejudice defendant's substantial rights. Further, it was not error to sentence defendant on both murder and unlawful use of a weapon because the merger doctrine did not apply, the lapse of time between pointing and shooting the gun precluded application of the single incident transaction, and the gun was also exhibited in the presence of the son's wife. The court also affirmed the denial of the Rule 29.15 motion, finding that the statement filed by the court-appointed attorney in lieu of an amended motion reflected compliance with the rule.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the possession of the four knives constituted four separate violations under &sect; 571.030(1). The plain and ordinary meaning of the word &quot;a&quot; was the singular &quot;one.&quot; Therefore, each knife that defendant carried concealed upon or about his person was an allowable unit of prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Department of Social Services challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Phelps County (Missouri), which held in respondent nursing home's action that challenged Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 13 &sect; 70-10.010's constitutionality that applying the per diem Medicaid rate adjustment under tit. 13 &sect; 70-10.010 violated equal protection guarantees and that the nursing home deserved the same rate as the providers with a calendar year fiscal year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court ruled in the home's favor in its action against the department in which the home asserted that tit. 13 &sect; 70-10.010, which established a new method of calculating the amounts that were paid to the nursing homes that participated in the state Medicaid program, denied equal protection of the law by not paying the home the same rate that providers with a calendar year fiscal year were allowed. The circuit court also ordered the department to increase the home's per diem rate to reflect the inflation that was allowed to those other nursing homes. The court reversed that judgment on appeal and remanded the action with directions to reinstate the administrative decision to the extent that it affirmed the department's rebased rate for the home. The court concluded that the rational basis test applied because participating in the Medicaid program was voluntary and did not constitute a fundamental right and because the home was not a member of a suspect class. The court also held that the new plan, which based the reimbursements on the most recent cost reports, rationally related to the legitimate interest in providing reasonable compensation to Medicaid providers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed a favorable ruling for the home in its action against the department as to constitutionality of a new method of calculating the allowable Medicaid per diem reimbursement that paid different rates to different providers and remanded the action to reinstate the administrative decision to the extent that it affirmed the department's rebased rate for the home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), plaintiffs had verdicts and judgments against defendant motor credit company (defendant) for actual and punitive damages on several counts growing out of defendant's repossession in a replevin action of an automobile in the possession of plaintiffs. Defendant appealed. Plaintiffs cross-appealed from the judgments in their libel and conversion claims against defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court awarded verdicts and judgments in favor of plaintiffs for actual and punitive damages on several counts growing out of defendant's repossession in a replevin action of an automobile in plaintiffs' possession. On appeal, the court stated that whether defendant's seizure of the automobile was &quot;state action,&quot; or whether defendant was a &quot;state actor,&quot; was a pivotal question. The court concluded that there was no evidence that defendant was in any sense a state actor in depriving plaintiffs of their Fourteenth Amendment due process rights. Further, the court held that the seizure of the automobile was not a violation of plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights. The procedure was justified by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 105.240 (1986). In addition, there was no evidence that defendant had any motive for the institution of the replevin suit other than to gain possession of the automobile. Finally, the court held that the evidence made no submissible case of libel against defendant. Defendant's credit report of &quot;repossession&quot; of the automobile was true. Truth was a complete defense to a charge of libel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment for plaintiffs for deprivation of plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment and Fourth Amendment rights. The court affirmed the judgment for defendants on plaintiffs' abuse of process claim. The court affirmed the judgment for plaintiffs on the conversion claim as to actual damages, as reduced to zero, and reversed the judgment as to punitive damages. The court reversed the judgment for plaintiffs on the libel claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff truck driver sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which found in favor of defendant manufacturer and truck plaza on his products liability action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The truck driver was injured when a tarp strap he was attempting to fasten came loose and struck him in the eye, causing him to lose his vision. A jury found in favor of the truck plaza where he purchased the strap and the manufacturer of the strap. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that by waiting two weeks after the trial had begun and only after the verdict was not in his favor, he waived his right to make a Baston challenge to the selection of the jury. As a good faith argument was evident, the driver was not precluded from raising the issue at jury selection or when his counsel became aware of alleged racial-based peremptory challenges. Waiting until after the trial to raise a Batson challenge was prejudicial to the opposing side and did not provide an opportunity for an improperly stricken venireperson to serve. Even though contributory negligence could not be argued as it was not raised as a defense, inquiries into his knowledge of the characteristics of the tarp strap, as well as the inquiries of whether the potential danger would be obvious to a reasonable person, were material to the elements he needed to prove to satisfy his burden.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment in favor of the truck plaza and the manufacturer on the truck driver's products liability action was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court determined in the survivor's malpractice action that the provider was not negligent as to the suicide of the patient, who had a history of severe emotional problems, after she received an abortion at the provider's clinic, and denied the survivor's new trial motion. The court affirmed the judgment on appeal. The court reasoned that erroneously providing a jury instruction that violated Mo. Approved Instructions 33.01, by being phrased as an affirmative converse but not hypothesizing independent evidence to defeat the survivor's claim, did not justify a new trial where the survivor did not show the crucial link between the alleged negligence of not obtaining a psychiatric history or monitoring the patient's mental health and the injury; the court noted there was no substantial evidence that the suicide was committed while the patient was suffering from an uncontrollable impulse or did not understand her acts' consequences. The court also found that dismissing the statutory negligence claim was proper because it was based on the noncompliance with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 188.028, the abortion consent statute, which the federal district court ruled to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a law school graduate, applied for admission to the bar, but his application was denied. He sued the local bar committee for conspiring to reject his application, and after summary judgment was entered against him, he filed a petition for re-hearing, which included threats against members of the committee. The petition was served on the committee's attorney, who informed two members of the committee. Defendant was convicted for harassment, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The use of an intermediary for the delivery of the threats did not absolve defendant of criminal liability. The statute was not overbroad. Defendant's threats were not privileged or protected by immunity because they were irrelevant to the civil case. Defendant was not denied due process as a result of name changes in the informations charging him because the offense charged did not change and there was no prejudice. The verdict was supported by evidence that defendant had an intent to disturb or frighten.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that the verdict director as to the charge of resisting arrest should not have been submitted, that the burglary and robbery charges should have been severed, and that a Mo.

The court affirmed defendant's convictions and the denial of his motion under Rule 29.15, finding that the record supported the decision to join the charges, that the sentence was valid, and that he did not show how the circuit court erred in its rulings and how it should have ruled. The court reasoned that the instruction on the resisting arrest charge did not prejudice defendant because it placed an undue burden on the State by requiring a showing both that he fled and used or threatened to use violence or physical force. The court also held that the joinder of the charges was valid because they related to the common scheme of escaping from a detention facility and that severance was not needed because the jury considered each offense separately. The court further determined that precedent showed that the 100-year sentence for the armed criminal action conviction was valid because there was no statutory maximum term for that conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city sought to acquire a water corporation's waterworks utility system, claiming that its acquisition by eminent domain was necessary for public use. The water corporation claimed, inter alia, that the judge was unable to enforce a condemnation without having secured an order from the Commission authorizing the transfer of the utility property sought in the underlying condemnation proceeding. The court agreed and issued a writ of prohibition. Pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 393.190.1 (1986), the Commission's approval was required before a water corporation could sell, assign, lease, transfer, mortgage or otherwise dispose of its franchise, works or system. The court found that the language used in &sect; 393.190.1 encompassed a transfer occasioned by a municipality's exercise of the power of eminent domain, even though the transfer was involuntary. The insurance of continued adequate service to the public was achieved by the required approval of the Commission. Since no such approval was yet obtained, the court's writ of prohibition was made permanent and the circuit court's condemnation proceedings were not to be instituted until the Commission's approval was obtained.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which convicted defendant for the sale of a controlled substance in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.211 (1992). Defendant was found to be a prior and persistent drug offender, under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 195.275, 195.291 (1992), but was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment as a prior and persistent offender, under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 558.016, 558.019.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In challenging his conviction for the sale of a controlled substance defendant contended on appeal that the State failed to establish a chain of custody regarding the controlled substance distributed by him. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to provide the trial court with a reasonable assurance that the controlled substance introduced at trial was the same and in like condition when tested by the forensic chemist as when purchased by the undercover officer. Defendant also challenged the undercover officer's pretrial and in-court identifications of him as the seller of the controlled substance. Because defendant had not established that any of the differences that he claimed existed between his picture and the others in the lineup made the lineup impermissibly suggestive, there was no need for the court to review the reliability of the undercover officer's in-court identification of defendant. The court upheld the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for the sale of a controlled substance but the case was remanded with directions that the trial court enter an order nunc pro tunc correcting the written judgment of conviction to remove all references to defendant's status as a persistent offender and adding that defendant was found to be a prior and persistent drug offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended the trial court erred in admitting a transcript of a tape recording that identified the drug seller on the recording by defendant's name, erred in overruling his Batson motion, erred in failing to strike a venireperson for cause, plainly erred in failing to sua sponte declare a mistrial as a result of an argument made by the prosecutor during the rebuttal portion of her closing argument, plainly erred in failing to &quot;challenge&quot; the constitutionality of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.214, and erred in overruling his motion to quash the indictment or stay the proceedings based on the composition of the grand and petit juries. Defendant further argued that the motion court clearly erred in denying his Mo. R. Crim. P. 29.15 motion in which he alleged he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to object to the introduction of a photograph showing a &quot;Warning Drug Free Zone&quot; sign in front of a school.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri) convicted defendant of first-degree murder and two counts of first-degree assault with serious physical injury. Defendant was sentenced as a repeat offender to life imprisonment without possibility of parole for murder to run consecutively with two concurrent 10-year terms for the assaults. The trial court denied defendant's Mo. R. Crim. P. 29.15 motion for a new trial. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the murder victim asked defendant if he had robbed the victim's nephew, defendant pulled out a gun and started shooting. The murder victim died at the scene. Two juvenile victims were shot in the shoulder and in the leg. Because two juvenile witnesses were victims of the assault, the court held that the trial court did not err in excluding evidence of their juvenile records for the sole purpose of generally discrediting the victims. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's Mo. R. Crim. P. 29.15 motion. Defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective for failure to call three alibi witnesses whose testimony was conflicting. Because the State failed to prove that a juvenile victim's leg injury was protracted, the court held that the trial court erred in finding that defendant committed a class A felony against that victim. Although the State used six of its seven peremptory challenges against black venire persons, the court held that the State's explanation that a juror was excused for unresponsive answers to questions was sufficiently racially neutral.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's conviction and sentence of defendant for first-degree murder. The court reversed the trial court's conviction of defendant for two counts of first-degree assault with serious physical injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The director's only point of appeal was that the trial court erroneously applied Mo. Rev.

Prior to July 1, 1992, &sect; 302.309.3(5) did not require that any period of the revocation be served prior to the issuance of limited driving privileges. Therefore, the issue presented on appeal was which version of &sect; 302.309.3(5) the trial court should have applied. The court held that the amendment applied, consequently, the trial court erred in applying the earlier version of the statute by granting the driver limited driving privileges prior to her completing the first 90 days of her revocation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was not denied the right to cross-examine the two juvenile victims of assault regarding their arrests subsequent to the incident, as the charges arising out of the arrests had been resolved prior to defendant's trial. Further, the victims were unlikely to testify against defendant in expectation of leniency and defendant offered no proof that deals were made to the victims. Even though defendant's post-trial motion under Mo. Crim. R. 29.15 was civil in nature, a judge assigned to the criminal division of the circuit court was qualified to grant the prosecutor permission to give shortened notice a deposition of an investigator taken in connection with the motion. However, as to one victim, the evidence of his injury to his left calf was not sufficient to sustain the conviction; evidence that his leg ached when the weather was cold or rainy did not show a protracted impairment of function. Indeed, the aches were as likely to occur when the leg was at rest or performing its normal function. The other victim's complaints of stiffness in his shoulder was sufficient, however, as stiffness was commonly understood to be associated with movement.</SPAN></P>

The son filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court sustained the son's motions as to the father and the mother, and the siblings dismissed their suit. On appeal, plaintiffs claimed that the trial court erred in granting the motions for summary judgment because the doctrine of parental immunity was inapplicable to their suit against the son. The court reversed and remanded, finding that the parental immunity doctrine would not have applied to the son because he had attained the age of majority pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 507.155 (Cum. Supp. 1993). Further, because the son had reached the age of majority, he could commence, prosecute, or defend an action in his own name at the time of the accident.

The court affirmed, holding that: (1) the variance was neither material nor prejudicial; (2) the statute did not require proof of a mutual understanding or an agreement by the person being solicited or approached but applied when the patron agreed to give money or property on the condition that certain sexual acts would be conducted; (3) the officer's testimony that he was in the park to investigate reports that lewd and indecent acts were taking place in the park between males was not prejudicial; and (4) the statute was sufficiently specific to provide fair warning that sucking the genitals of another person was within the conduct that was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

The court also ruled that the trial court did not err in its jury instruction regarding reasonable doubt, which had been patterned after Mo. Ann. Instructions Crim.

The employee suffered an injury on the job, recovered workers' compensation benefits, and settled a products liability claim against a third party.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured in the course of employment when a tire rim he repaired exploded. After his civil action was settled, his attorney filed an interpleader action against the employee, his wife, and the compensation carrier. An appeal was first filed in the Supreme Court of Missouri, challenging the validity of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.150 under constitutional provisions. The supreme court transferred the case to the court. Appellants asserted that the compensation carrier was not entitled to interest, that the trial court erred when it included the portion of the workers' compensation benefits attributable to the employee's disfigurement in the subrogation calculation, and that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.150 was unconstitutional. The court rejected the arguments and affirmed the judgment. The trial court had not abused its discretion when it awarded the compensation carrier a pro rata share of the accumulated interest on the interplead fund. The employee's settlement was subject to the subrogation interest of the employer. The interpleader action merely determined the exact amount of money to which the employer was entitled after applying the appropriate formula.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the trial judge's imposition of sentence under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 588.016 (Supp. 1992) was unconstitutional because it was an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in July 1990 and later convicted and sentenced in July 1991. In August 1990, &sect; 588.016 (Supp. 1992) was passed that changed the sentencing law and permitted the judge, not the jury, to impose a sentence on defendant as a persistent misdemeanor offender. On review, defendant argued that the imposition of his sentence was the result of an ex post facto law and violated his rights under U.S. Const. amends. IV, V, VI, and XIV, and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 10 and 18. Also, defendant argued that the trial court erroneously denied his Batson challenge to the prosecutor's exclusion of a black juror during voir dire. The court rejected the appeal. The court found that &sect; 588.016(Supp. 1992) was retrospective, but it did not prejudice defendant because it merely changed the procedure for sentencing and did not produce a substantive change in sentencing criteria. The court also found no merit in the Batson challenge because the voir dire record did not reveal that the prosecutor's objections were pretextual. The court also did not find any error the trial court's instruction on reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), granted the car manufacturer and dealer's motion for a new trial after the jury returned a damage award in favor of the purchasers. The purchasers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchasers sought damages against the manufacturer and dealer for fraudulently misrepresenting the condition of the vehicle, breach of express warranty, breach of contract, and a declaratory judgment for removal of a lien on the car. Both parties argued that the lower court should have granted their respective motions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the purchasers' claim that the dealer had made a material misrepresentation of a statement of fact, which permitted submission to the jury. Therefore, the lower court's decision to grant the dealer a new trial constituted error. On the other hand, the lower court was within its discretion when it granted the manufacturer a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of evidence because no evidence had been presented that the manufacturer knew of the dealer's misrepresentations. Therefore, the manufacturer was entitled to invoke its warranty disclaimer of consequential damages. The dealer's conduct supported a consideration of punitive damages because its representations influenced the purchasers to pay a higher price.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Th judgment granting the manufacturer a new trial was affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state Medicaid agency sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri), that reversed on equal protection grounds the decision of the Administrative Hearing Commission regarding the recalculation of the per diem rate to be paid to respondent nursing home under the state Medicaid program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the state Medicaid agency's new per diem rate plan was unconstitutional because it did not factor into its calculus the inflation rate for a certain interval. The state Medicaid agency appealed and prevailed. The Commission's decisions based upon its interpretation of law were matters that underwent de novo appellate review. A duly enacted statute was presumed to be constitutional. A government action which neither created suspect classifications nor impinged on a fundamental right withstood scrutiny if the classification bore some rational relationship to a legitimate government interest. Equal protection was offended only if a classification rested on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the state's objective. In the area of economics and social welfare, a state did not violate the Equal Protection Clause merely because its classification was imperfect. If the classification had some &quot;reasonable basis,&quot; it did not offend the Constitution simply because the classification was not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it resulted in some inequality. The state Medicaid agency properly rebased the nursing home's per diem rates.</SPAN></P>

The applicant cross-appealed because of the restrictions placed on the permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The notices for the hearing to determine whether to issue a special use permit to the applicant were not posted. The BZA granted the applicant a restricted special use permit to perform underground mining. The owners and the association appealed to the trial court to contest the issuance of the permit. The applicant intervened to challenge the BZA's restrictions on the permit. The trial court affirmed the BZA's decision. The court held that the permit was properly issued and dismissed the applicant's appeal. The court held that the BZA did not have to post the notices pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 64.211 through 64.295 because the permit was limited in scope and did not affect the entire county or an entire district within the county. Even though two of the BZA members pre-judged the issue whether to grant the permit, they kept their minds open and made their final decisions based on the evidence presented at the BZA hearings. Thus, they were impartial and fair in their decision whether to issue the permit. The applicant's appeal was dismissed because its intervention raised a new and foreign issue to the original appeal, specifically, the constitutionality of the restrictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The MHTC brought condemnation proceedings to take part of the owner's property to widen a highway, and deposited its commissioner's assessment of $ 1000. The owners withdrew the deposit and filed exceptions. The MHTC did not disturb the property during proceedings, which resulted in a jury award to the owners of $ 20,000. After the verdict, which neither party sought to vacate, the circuit court allowed the MHTC to abandon the condemnation, ordered payment of interest on the difference the assessment and verdict, and denied costs and attorney fees. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the MHTC effectively took title when its deposit was withdrawn, but it had the right to abandon the condemnation because it had not taken any steps to exercise its property rights. The court ruled that the abandonment voided the jury's reassessment, but the owners were entitled to compensation for the period that they were divested of title, and the undisputed jury award was an appropriate standard from which to calculate the loss in the form of interest under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 523.045. The court held that absent bad faith, the MHTC, as a public entity, was not liable for costs and fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city challenged the trial court's reversal of the city manager's discharge of the police officer from the city's police force. The city asserted that there was substantial competent evidence to support the police officer's discharge. The court reversed and remanded, noting that although the civil service board made recommendations regarding personnel decisions, the city manager made the final decision for the city. The court stated that it would review the decision of the city manager, not that of the trial court. The court found that the evidence showed that the officer made contradictory statements regarding a speeding ticket that he issued. One month after the issuance of the ticket, the officer doubted that the speed was correct, but when interviewed by the civil service board he stated that he vouched for the ticket's accuracy. The officer had previously been disciplined for striking a witness. The court held that the evidence supported the city manager's decision and also held that the officer's due process rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which convicted defendant of rape, assault, armed criminal action, and property damage. Defendant also appealed the denial of his motion pursuant to Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.15 for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Between the time of defendant's arrest and his trial, the Missouri legislature amended Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.016 to allow a judge, rather than a jury, to sentence persons who were persistent misdemeanor offenders. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in sentencing him as a persistent misdemeanor offender because the application of &sect; 558.016 to his case was an ex post facto law and the change from jury sentencing to judge sentencing increased his punishment. The court disagreed. The persistent misdemeanor amendment to &sect; 558.016 did not operate to increase defendant's prison term but merely removed sentencing from the jury and gave it to the judge. The judge was still bound by the terms of imprisonment authorized in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.011. Moreover, there was no constitutional right to jury sentencing. The court also rejected defendant's claim of ineffectiveness of counsel. Defendant's own statements indicate that his counsel had satisfied the duty to make a reasonable investigation of possible mitigating evidence; his counsel called the public defender to obtain photographs that defendant alleged supported his theory of self-defense but was told that none existed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that because the foreign corporation did not possess a certificate of authority to transact business in Missouri when it conducted business in Missouri and when its purported cause of action arose, it was required under Mo.

The circuit court dismissed, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the counts of the petition, which alleged that intentional tort and gross negligence caused the wrongful death of the decedent. Summary judgment was granted to the employer on all of the other counts. The court affirmed, holding that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction despite the constitutional challenges raised by appellants because pursuant to the workers' compensation statutes, the Labor and Industrial Relations Commission had exclusive jurisdiction to determine the nature of the decedent's injury. The court rejected appellants' contention that the theory of dual capacity allowed them to recover under both the workers' compensation statutes and tort law because Missouri did not adopt the dual capacity doctrine, and even if it had, appellants failed to state a cognizable claim under Missouri law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant prevailed. Under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 577.010.1 (1986), a person committed the crime of &quot;driving while intoxicated&quot; if he operated a motor vehicle while in an intoxicated or drugged condition. Accepting as true all of the evidence favorable to the prosecution, and disregarding all evidence and inferences to the contrary, the proof against defendant was sufficient that a reasonable juror might find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The arresting officer's observation of defendant's erratic driving was sufficient to give the arresting officer reasonable suspicion to stop defendant. Objective assessment of the arresting officer's actions in light of the facts and circumstances confronting him at that time showed that the arresting officer had probable cause to arrest defendant. The trial court improperly sentenced defendant as a prior offender because, although Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 577.010.2 (1986)required two previous intoxication-related traffic convictions to predicate it, defendant had only one.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgments. The court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 211.459.4, 210.140 clearly indicated that the doctor-patient privilege was not grounds for excluding the evidence testimony from therapists, counselors, and psychiatrists. The court found that the father's argument that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 211.459.4 was unconstitutional was without merit. The court held that the governmental interest in protecting children from abuse and neglect clearly outweighed the father's private interest. The court denied the hearsay argument regarding the social workers' termination studies, which were prepared pursuant to the mandate of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 211.455.3.

The court held that defendant waived his right to the mandatory change of judges when he filed his motion to request the change three months after it was due. The court held that the trial judge was not required to recuse herself because she did not possess personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding. The court held that, although she was aware from prior proceedings of the fact of the ex-wife's injuries, those facts were not disputed in the criminal trial. The court further held that there was nothing in the record to suggest that the jury, which began its deliberations at 10:30 p.m. and carried on into the early morning hours was unduly fatigued.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Missouri Board of Pharmacy filed a complaint with the Administrative Hearing Commission (AHC) seeking a hearing and determination that the pharmacist's license and the pharmacy permit could be revoked or suspended under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 338.055 (Supp. 1984). The court observed that when the applicable statute was enacted, the reference book was revised every decade, but it was changed to five-year intervals. Because the legislature's plain intent was to require pharmacies to have the latest version, the court read the statute as if the word &quot;decennial&quot; was absent. The court held that the pharmacist in charge was to see that the licenses of pharmacy employees were conspicuously displayed. The court held that report inaccuracies evidenced the pharmacist's failure to verify. Because the ordinary patient would understand &quot;docusate sodium&quot; as well as he could understand &quot;DSS,&quot; the court opined that the pharmacist satisfied the statute. The court held that the finding that the pharmacist improperly substituted generic drugs was supported by competent and substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of molesting several children. At trial, the children, aged seven, testified against him. The court affirmed the convictions and found that the requirements of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491.060 (1986) for a child under the age of ten to testify had been met. The court found that the child's testimony was consistent with the testimony of other witnesses and so attested to her truthfulness. The court found that in every other respect, the testimony corroborated that of the other victims, and the requirements of &sect; 491.060 to qualify the child as a competent witness was satisfied. The court held that defendant's allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel were without merit and the denial of defendant's motion was not clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual was arrested for the misdemeanor of stealing under $ 150. The arrest arose out of a markdown error and, as a result, charges were never brought. The records relating to the arrest were closed pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 610.100. MSHP argued that the trial court erred in using its equitable power to order the expungement of the individual's criminal arrest record because such relief was in direct conflict with Mo. Rev. &sect;&sect; 610.120 and &sect; 109.270, which explicitly stated that such records should not be destroyed. The court weighed the state's interest in maintaining the arrest record against the unwarranted harm the individual could suffer if the records were not expunged. The court ruled that the arrest record had dire consequences in that it could prevent the individual from pursuing a career in law enforcement. The state had little legitimate interest in maintaining the arrest records because there was evidence that the arrest was unfounded and it was the only arrest on his record. Thus, the trial court did not err in using its equitable power to order expungement of the arrest record.</SPAN></P>

Appellant alleged that the court lacked jurisdiction because &sect; 195.214 was unconstitutional. The court ruled that appellant's constitutional claim was merely colorable and not substantial; thus, the court had jurisdiction. The court concluded that &sect; 195.214 was constitutional and did not require appellant to have actual knowledge of the proximity of the school. Appellant challenged the denial of his Mo. Sup. Ct.

In his motion, he alleged ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel did not endorse and produce a certain witness who would have provided appellant with an alibi.

The candidates and the party had filed a petition for writ of mandamus to compel respondent secretary of state to include the candidates' name on the ballot for an upcoming general election for state and local offices.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A political party obtained adequate signatures under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 115.315.4 (1986) on petitions for the secretary of state to certify it as a statewide political party for a general election, but the secretary refused to place the party's local candidates, who sought the offices of county sheriff and county assessor, and certain of its statewide candidates, on the ballot. The candidates and the party sought writ of mandamus to compel the secretary to include the candidates' name on the ballot. The trial court held that candidates for county offices were required to show an additional modicum of local support. On appeal from the denial of the petition, the court held that: (1) decisions requiring local candidates of a newly formed statewide political party to demonstrate additional local support were overruled as unconstitutional; (2) its review was under the strict scrutiny standard requiring the State to use the least restrictive means of protecting its interests; and (3) the party, once certified statewide, was not required to get additional signatures for local candidates, and the county's ballot would not have suffered by the inclusion of the local candidates.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed, as to the local candidates, the trial court's judgment, which had denied the petition of the candidates for writ of mandamus against the secretary of state, and affirmed the judgment in all other aspects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was denied disability retirement benefits. The employee's appeal was dismissed one year later without prejudice for failure to prosecute. A second petition for review was filed by the employee more than a month later. The trial court upheld the Board's findings. Considering the relevant ordinance in light of the definition of a &quot;contested case&quot; under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.010.2 (1986), the court found the matter likely involved a contested case. Further, the court concluded that the Board used a formal process for review of the matter, as shown by the facts that a transcript was prepared, witnesses were sworn before testifying, witnesses were cross-examined by opposing counsel, and evidentiary rules were utilized. Thus the court held that because the ordinance utilized required a determination of rights after a formal proceeding before a competent tribunal, the matter was a &quot;contested case&quot; falling within the time limitations of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.110. Because the employee's second petition for review was filed beyond the 30-day limit, the trial court was without jurisdiction to review the agency proceedings. Thus the court lacked jurisdiction as well.</SPAN></P>

The court found that it had jurisdiction because the trial court's order was final and appealable, even though respondents would usually reply to an alternative writ once it was issued rather than to the petition. The court found that a writ of mandamus was appropriate only when it would compel ministerial, and not discretionary, actions. The court found that under Mo. Rev.

The applicant contended that the statutes under which he was originally committed and under which he sought release were unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's order, finding that the constitutional issues were not cognizable on appeal because the issues were never before the trial court. The court also found that the amended application was not filed pursuant to Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 55.33 within 20 days after the pleading to be amended was served and, therefore, was without effect. The applicant also asserted that the trial court erred by requiring him to assume the burden of proof to show that he would not be sexually dangerous or to show that he had improved to the extent that his release would not be incompatible to the welfare of society. The court rejected this contention, finding that the party asserting an affirmative issue bore the burden of proof. By filing his petition, the applicant was asserting the affirmative of the issue and, thus, the applicant bore the burden to prove grounds for release.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the board did not abuse its discretion or exceed its authority when it decided to modify the discipline recommended by the police chief by fashioning a remedy that gave the police officer a chance to rehabilitate himself and remain on the force. The court stated that under a fair reading of the statutes giving the board its powers, the board had authority to fashion such a punishment. Modifying the discipline was discretionary because the board could choose whether to affirm, modify or reverse the police chief's recommendation. The board did not unconstitutionally deprive the police officer of his right to procedural due process. The police officer received a full evidentiary hearing regarding the police chief's recommendation of termination. Under these facts, the court concluded that the police officer did not suffer an unconstitutional deprivation.</SPAN></P>

The employee argued that the caselaw violated various constitutional provisions. On review, the court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the case. In reaching its conclusion, the court held that it was bound by prior caselaw rejecting separation of powers and open courts challenges to the caselaw interpreting the state's workers' compensation exclusive remedy statute. The court then held that the employee failed to preserve for review his claim concerning the retroactive application of the caselaw regarding the commission's jurisdiction because the employee did not raise the issue in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitions were filed in 1986 and 1998 seeking the dissolution of the road district, but neither were signed by the owners of a majority of the land in the district.

Nevertheless, the commission held the hearing and dissolved the district. The commission contended that the 1986 and 1988 petitions constitute &quot;a petition&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 233.295 and that the withdrawals were ineffective. The court held that the issues could not be resolved because the court had no jurisdiction of a direct appeal from an order of the commission. The action of the trial judge acting as the commission was an administrative decision. As such, it was subject to judicial review in the manner prescribed by Mo. Const. of 1945, art.

Defendant's motion to suppress the marijuana and his statements were denied, as was his motion for an acquittal. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction. The court ruled that defendant lacked standing under the Fourth Amendment to challenge the search of the van because he was a passenger. However, the court ruled that the marijuana and defendant's statements were inadmissible as the fruits of an unlawful search. The court held that the initial search was valid but that defendant's detention thereafter was unreasonable because the trooper did not have reason to believe that he was in danger.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparents instituted filed an action under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.402 (1991), seeking grandparent visitation rights to see their grandson. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.402 allowed courts to grant reasonable visitation rights to the grandparents of a child and issue any necessary orders to enforce the decree. The trial court found the grandparents had been unreasonably denied visitation for over 90 days, that visitation with the grandparents was in the best interests of the grandson and would not endanger his physical health nor impair his emotional development. The initial question on appeal was the court's jurisdiction to consider the appeal by the parents.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Missouri Highway and Transportation Commission (Commission) appealed an award of damages from the Circuit Court of Greene County (Missouri), in favor of defendant property owner, in an action exercising the power of eminent domain, for the acquisition of an easement for the construction of a freeway through the subject property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On its appeal, the Commission's principal assertions of trial court error stemmed from the admission of expert opinions valuing the farm rezoned as a planned unit development (PUD) containing commercial, multi-family residential and single-family residential property. The Commission first contended that the appraisers were erroneously permitted to determine damages by the &quot;capitalization&quot; or &quot;lot&quot; method. The court found the determination of damages by the lot method by multiplying the value of a fictional lot (average acre) by the number of lots (acres) taken was erroneous. The Commission next contended that because the farm was zoned &quot;A-1 (Agricultural)&quot; and &quot;R-1 (Single-family)&quot; the trial court erred in permitting the appraisers to express a value of an acre as if in fact zoned for commercial or multi-family use. The court held the trial court erred in permitting the appraisers to value unidentified portions of the farm as commercial property and as multi-family property, contrary to the established rule, upon a vague standard of &quot;reasonable probability&quot; of rezoning. Trial court error in admitting testimony prejudicial to the Commission required reversal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in favor of the property owner, and remanded the cause for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police placed an ad in the newspaper to attract pedophiles they hoped to arrest in a sting operation. Defendant responded and accepted a videotape of child pornography from an undercover officer, which he offered to trade for a friend's homemade child pornography. On appeal, defendant claimed, inter alia, entrapment and that his daughter, whom he had pose for photo sessions, was not &quot;nude&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 568.060. The court affirmed. Defendant's entrapment defense failed for lack of substantial evidence that he was induced to promote child pornography and lacked the predisposition to commit the crime. Defendant's daughter was nude for purposes of &sect; 568.060 when photos were taken of her in a g-string bikini with no top. The court refused to read &quot;nudity&quot; as requiring that the child be completely undressed, as defendant argued, because it would destroy most of the statute's protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff telephone customer challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), which sustained a motion to dismiss the customer's petition, filed by defendant telephone company, alleging breach of contract and negligence claims, for failure to state a claim upon which relief could have been granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customer alleged that the company failed to place an &quot;intercept&quot; informing callers to the customer's business that their phone number had changed. However, the company argued that tariffs approved by the Missouri Public Service Commission included limitations on the company's liability. On appeal, the court held that the trial court improperly dismissed the customer's claims. Specifically, the court first held that, although the customer presented a constitutional challenge alleging that the limitation on liability was unconstitutional, the customer failed to present a substantial constitutional claim; thus, jurisdiction was properly maintained by the court. As for the merits of the appeal, the court rejected the argument that the customer had no standing because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17.7.2(J) specified that a customer did not have a property right in any telephone number. Instead, the court held that the provision had no bearing on the case because the customer claimed under a contractual agreement. Lastly, the court held that although the company's potential liability was limited, the customer might have been entitled to a credit on its phone bill for the interrupted service.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, which had sustained the company's motion to dismiss the customer's petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lived with his wife and her children. The daughter's cousin often stayed overnight with the family. Defendant approached his five-year-old stepdaughter while she was in bed and touched her vagina with his hand, mouth, and penis. Her cousin, who was six, observed the touching and also was touched on the vagina. A psychologist interviewed the girls and testified at trial, as did a physician. Defendant confessed. The trial court convicted defendant. The court affirmed. The trial court did not err by admitting the girls' statements. A trial judge could allow inadmissible evidence to be presented in a bench trial. A doctor's recitation of statements made by a child victim of sexual assault was not hearsay and not objectionable. Even if the evidence could have been considered hearsay, the trial court had statutory discretion pursuant to &sect; 491.075 to determine whether the time, content, and circumstances of a child's statement provided sufficient indicia of reliability. The experts' testimony did not constitute improper bolstering because the victims testified in addition to having their out-of-court statements admitted into evidence, as required by &sect; 491.075.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction for unlawfully distributing a controlled substance. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss his trial counsel on the day of trial because defendant did not show the irreconcilable conflict of a total breakdown in communication. Defendant waived the issue of admission of a partially inaudible tape recording of the transaction into evidence by stating that there was no objection. Also, allowing the jury to hear the tape during deliberations was not an abuse of discretion. The tape had been played in open court, and it was played only once during deliberations. Defendant failed to show how he was prejudiced on appeal by the fact that the tape recording was lost. The trial court properly denied defendant's Rule 29.15 motion in which he contended that his trial counsel was ineffective. Defendant was not prejudiced by his purported failure to meet more frequently with his counsel or by counsel's failure to request a continuance because defendant failed to show what information counsel failed to discover that would have led to a viable defense.</SPAN></P>

P. 29.15 motion for post conviction relief. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.214 (1989) was valid and constitutional. The court held that the statute was not vague because the words &quot;school&quot; and &quot;within one thousand feet&quot; had a plain and ordinary meaning and were understandable by persons of ordinary intelligence. The court found no discriminatory use of peremptory challenges because after the trial court found that the State's reasons were race-neutral, defendant failed to meet his duty of showing that the reasons were pretextual. The court held that defendant could not argue pretext for the first time on appeal. The court held that the motion court did not err in denying defendant's Mo. R. Crim. P. 29.15 motion because his trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to interview and depose state's witnesses. The court held that the decision whether to interview or depose a witness was generally a matter of trial strategy and did not provide an adequate basis for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, as a juvenile, purposely killed her mother. The juvenile court dismissed the petition and ordered that appellant be prosecuted under the general law. Appellant entered a guilty plea to a reduced charge of voluntary manslaughter with the understanding that the prosecutor would recommend five years' probation. The trial court sentenced appellant to eleven years of imprisonment in an adult prison. Thereafter, there were numerous proceedings in state and federal court. Eventually, the federal court of appeals held in abeyance its decision on appellant's habeas corpus action pending the outcome of a motion to recall the mandate in the state circuit court. The motion was sustained, and the appeal followed. The reviewing court found that the trial court, in failing to advise appellant of rejection of the plea agreement, to advise her the court was not bound by the plea agreement, and to afford her the opportunity to withdraw her guilty plea, violated Mo. R. Crim. P. 24.02. Accordingly, the court set aside the guilty plea and remanded the case for entry of a new plea.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was requested by an arresting officer to submit to a blood-alcohol test, and he refused. Defendant filed a pre-trial motion in limine to suppress evidence of the refusal, and the trial court sustained it. In affirming that judgment, the court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 577.041.1 did not permit evidence of defendant's refusal of a blood-alcohol test to have been used at trial in a manslaughter case. Section 577.041.1 only permitted such evidence in cases of driving while intoxicated and driving with excessive blood-alcohol content.</SPAN></P>

He contended that the trial court was without jurisdiction to terminate his parental rights as there was no adjudication of neglect or abuse against him and that the foster parents improperly intervened in the termination proceedings. He also challenged the constitutionality of certain statutes. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the foster parents were not permitted, through their lawyer or otherwise, to participate in the termination proceedings. Their participation tainted the proceeding to a degree that reversal was required. The foster parents' lawyer not only cross-examined witnesses, he also called the foster parents to testify. The evidence he presented had nothing to do with whether grounds existed for termination of the father's parental rights. While there was no evidence that the father made any provision for parental support of the daughter or to visit or communicate with her, there was also no convincing evidence that he failed to do so either. The court was without jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of the statutes at issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision of the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which, upon remand to conduct an evidentiary hearing to ascertain whether the prosecutor used preemptory strikes in a discriminatory manner, found that both race and sex discrimination were absent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the action for an evidentiary hearing to ascertain whether the prosecutor used peremptory strikes in a discriminatory manner. Two potential jurors were struck mainly due to their weak answers on the death penalty. The trial court, on remand, found that both race and sex discrimination were absent. On appeal, defendant claimed, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash the jury because the State exercised 9 of its 11 peremptory strikes against female members of the venire in a discriminatory manner, giving pretextual reasons unsupported by the record. The court held that gender-based challenges undermined public confidence in jury selection but that the prosecutor did not exercise his peremptory strikes to eliminate potential jurors based upon their gender or their race. Because the holding was inconsistent with case law, the court transferred the action to the Supreme Court. However, the court reversed the trial court's ruling on defendant's Rule 29.15 motion because defendant timely filed his verified amended motion and a timely filed, properly verified, amended motion cured the absence of verification of defendant's pro se motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's finding that there was no race or sex discrimination in the selection of the jury, but transferred the action to the Missouri Supreme Court due to a split within the districts of the court. The court reversed the denial of defendant's motion for post-conviction relief and remanded for further action.</SPAN></P>

He was convicted on a plea of guilty. Defendant filed a motion to vacate the judgment and sentence, which was denied. He appealed and claimed that Mo. Rev.

The court held that it could not consider the issue because it was not raised by defendant's post-conviction motion and thus could not be considered on appeal. The court determined that the trial court had found that defendant's plea was not induced by any threats or promises and was made voluntarily with a full understanding of the consequences thereof. The findings and conclusions of the trial court regarding defendants claim that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his motion because his guilty pleas had been entered involuntarily was not clearly erroneous and was fully supported by the record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which sentenced him as a prior offender to 10 years imprisonment after a jury found him guilty of sale of cocaine in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.211 (Cum. Supp. 1991). He also appealed the trial court's judgment, denying his Mo. R. Crim. P. 29.15 motion for post-conviction relief without an evidentiary hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after he sold cocaine to an undercover detective. At trial, defendant testified that, immediately prior to his arrest, he saw a person get out of a car and point a gun at four or five people standing nearby. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. It found no error in the State's comments during closing argument regarding defendant's failure to produce one of the individuals who were, according to defendant, allegedly present the evening of the drug sale. After a defendant had testified, it was not improper for the prosecutor in closing argument to comment regarding the lack of evidence supporting defendant's position. The court also found the trial court did not abuse its discretion in playing for the jury a tape of the drug transaction recorded by the detective. Further, the trial court did not err in denying, without a hearing, defendant's Mo. R. Crim. P. 29.15 motion for post-conviction relief on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel. Defense counsel's failure to object to the remarks of the State during closing argument, or to the playing of the tape, did not result in a substantial deprivation of defendant's right to a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant, a drunken 17 year old, shot and killed his friend, he was convicted of second degree murder and armed criminal action. He appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that he was not entitled to additional peremptory challenges because the State had waived the death penalty. Although the prosecutor had made questionable comments during voir dire, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by sustaining the objection and then guiding the prosecution back to a general discussion. Further, the trial court properly denied defendant's motions to disqualify the prosecutor because defendant was not prejudiced by the prosecutor's advise to police officers regarding an interview by defendant's attorney. Admission of gruesome photographs was proper because they tended to prove material elements in the case. However, the court was compelled by defendant's argument that his due process rights were violated by prohibition of expert testimony on the intoxication defense. Accordingly, the court recommended that the action be transferred to the Supreme Court of Missouri for reexamination of existing law with respect to proof of intoxication as negating specific intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a decedent's daughter and a patient's girlfriend, sought review of an order by the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri) that granted defendant doctor's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) and alternative motion for a new trial in plaintiffs' medical malpractice action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was taken to a mental health center by police pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.305.4 (1986). After the doctor diagnosed him with alcohol abuse and probable PCP psychosis, he was released into police custody with a recommendation of dependency treatment. Several days later, the patient became violent and murdered the decedent, who was trying to protect the girlfriend. He was later diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. On appeal, the court affirmed. Although plaintiffs argued that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.440 created an exception to the common law principles regarding the duty owed by physicians at state mental institutions, the court held that plaintiffs failed to prove the doctor's duties were not performed in good faith and without gross negligence. While the court noted that differing degrees of negligence had not been generally recognized in the State, the court found no evidence of any fault beyond ordinary negligence based on the expert testimony presented. The court determined that a misdiagnosis could be negligent but not a conscious indifference tantamount to willful and wanton abrogation of professional duties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the granting of a JNOV in favor of the doctor.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant's contention of unconstitutionality was more than merely colorable. The statutes did not define deceptive practices or fraud, but merely declared such practices unlawful. Because defendant's challenge was not merely colorable, the appellate court lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Mo. Const. art. 5, &sect; 3 gave the state supreme court the exclusive appellate jurisdiction in all cases involving the validity of a statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant movant pled guilty, via a plea agreement, to selling amphetamine and methamphetamine, and three counts of distributing methamphetamine near a school. He was convicted in the Circuit Court of Greene County (Missouri) as a prior and persistent, class X offender, and sentenced to concurrent confinements of 20 years on each count. He filed a Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 24.035 motion, which was denied without an evidentiary hearing. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to his motion, the motion court appointed a public defender and granted an additional 30 days to file an amended motion. The counsel filed an amended Rule 24.035 motion, which was held untimely. The motion court found no entitlement to an evidentiary hearing on his pending pro se motion. The movant asserted error in the ruling that postconviction counsel's failure to timely file an amended motion was not due to the neglect or abandonment of counsel. However, he had the burden of demonstrating that the untimely filing was not the product of his negligence or neglect, and he failed to do so. He argued that he was improperly sentenced as a class X offender, in that two of his four prior felony convictions occurred over 25 years before the charged offenses. The question was reviewed under the plain error rule. It was within the legislature's prerogative to provide for a lesser minimum term for defendant who had committed one crime more than 25 years ago. As for his claim of error in disposing of his pro se motion without a hearing, the plea hearing transcript demonstrated that it was voluntarily entered and refuted the grounds for relief that he stated in his motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the findings and conclusions of the motion court were not clearly erroneous. The motion court's order that denied the movant's motion was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, an employee and an employer, appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which awarded plaintiffs, a mother and a minor daughter, damages and prejudgment interest for personal injuries the minor daughter sustained when she was struck by a truck driven by the employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiffs filed personal injury action against the defendants. The plaintiffs claimed that the employee was negligent either in failing to keep a careful lookout or in driving at an excessive speed when he struck the minor child. The court held that the plaintiffs made a submissible case on both failing to keep a careful lookout and excessive speed. The employee testified that he was aware that children were playing around the fire hydrant. That evidence along with the fact that he did not slow or swerve before hitting the child was sufficient for the jury to infer that he either was not keeping a careful lookout, or was traveling at an excessive speed. The court properly denied the defendants' motion to amend their answers to allege contributory negligence of the daughter, because four years olds are incapable of negligence as a matter of law. The trial court abused its discretion in allowing the jury to see the chart listing figures calculated by the plaintiffs' attorney during deliberations, which influenced their verdict. The issue of damages was transferred the case to the Supreme Court of Missouri. The judgment was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners sought review of an order of the Circuit Court of Platte County (Missouri) that granted respondent city's motion for summary judgment, in the property owners' inverse condemnation action against the city. The trial court granted the city summary judgment on the ground that the action was barred by the five year statute of limitations, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.120.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners inherited their land from the grantor. While the grantor owned the property, the Army Corps classified the land as flood plain, and the city passed an ordinance limiting the land's use. The court ruled that the property owners' action was time-barred under &sect; 516.120. In reaching this conclusion, the court noted that the statute of limitations period began to run when the ordinance was passed because the restrictive nature of the ordinance should have altered the decedent that the value of the land would have been diminished. The court found this to be true, even though the exact amount of the damages might not have been known at that time. Because the ordinance was passed more than five years before the property owners even acquired the property, the decedent's right to damages for inverse condemnation did not even pass to them. Finally, the court noted that the city's failure to raise the issue of statute of limitations in its answer did not serve as a waiver. The city would have been entitled to amend its answer, pursuant to Mo. R. Civ. P. 55.33(a), to include the affirmative defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual filed an action against a railroad company, alleging an age discrimination claim under the MHRA and a claim under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.

The individual brought an original proceeding in mandamus to challenge the order, claiming that Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 22(a) secured his right to a jury trial under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 213.111. Upon a review of the legislative history of the MHRA, the court determined that the legislature did not intend to provide for trial by jury in cases under the MHRA. The court also determined that the individual did not have a constitutional right to a jury trial under Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 22(a) because the procedures of Chapter 213 of the MHRA were not known in common law and were not in existence prior to the adoption of the Missouri Constitution of 1945, and an action under the MHRA was essentially equitable in nature, notwithstanding the fact that the MHRA authorized the courts to award money damages to a complainant.</SPAN></P>

The court upheld the judgment of conviction, finding no merit to defendant's contentions of error.

Rev.

On review, the court found that the State's explanation to the trial court of the reasons for peremptory strikes showed no discriminatory motivation even though 11 members of the panel were white and defendant was black. The court found no error in sustaining the State's motion for sanctions because of his failure to provide the court with notes about witness interviews, and found no error in limiting an expert's testimony to the scope of the expert's knowledge. The court ruled that there was evidence to deny his motion for acquittal because deliberation could be inferred from the circumstance surrounding the homicide. The court found no error in overruling his objection to an instruction on self-defense because the burden rested on the State to show the homicide was not justified.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was dismissed from her employment by the employer. She appealed the dismissal to the Personnel Advisory Board (PAB), which affirmed the action. The employee then sought review of the PAB decision by an administrative review tribunal under Mo. Rev.

The employer filed concurrent appeals with the court and in a local trial court and requested a jurisdictional decision. The court concluded that it was without subject matter jurisdiction of the decision under &sect; 36.390.9 because adjudication by an administrative review tribunal under &sect; 36.390.9 was not a judicial pronouncement and could not be the basis for an appeal to the court. It dismissed the appeal and remanded to the administrative review tribunal for hearing on evidence as provided for in contested cases by Mo. Rev.

The question before the court was whether a viable fetus was a &quot;person&quot; within the meaning of the involuntary manslaughter statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.024. The court believed that it was the legislative intent that the &quot;person&quot; as used in &sect; 565.024 included a viable fetus. The court also concluded that the inclusion of the viable fetus within the word &quot;person&quot; was not to be applied only prospectively, which would have led to the acquittal of the defendant. Although defendant did not have notice that the killing of a viable fetus was a homicide within the meaning of the statute, the holding that a viable fetus was a person for purposes of the involuntary homicide statute was plainly foreseeable, if not inevitable.</SPAN></P>

After a hearing, the Board voted to terminate the teacher based on her willful violation of a Board policy and pursuant to the Missouri Tenured Teacher Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 168.141.1(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher left seven students in the classroom during recess, then she went to the playground for a total of 15 to 17 minutes. During this time, several of the unsupervised students in the classroom sexually assaulted a classmate. The District served the teacher with written charges of intentional violation of and failure to obey Board policies. The Board voted to terminate her employment, but the circuit court reversed. The court reversed the judgment on appeal, finding that the policy was not fatally vague and indefinite. The court held that the phrases &quot;a few minutes&quot; and the word &quot;responsible,&quot; as used in the policy, should not have prevented the teacher from sufficiently understanding and complying with the policy while exercising common sense. The policy was not vague because &sect; 168.114.1(4) provided the consequences for a teacher's failure to comply with a Board's policy. The court found that the evidence indicated that just prior to the incident, the teacher was aware of a policy that prohibited leaving the students unattended for more than a few minutes, yet she intended to leave several students unattended for more than a few minutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment, and remanded with instructions to reinstate the decision of the Board.</SPAN></P>

On review the court noted that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 556.041 (1978) provided that a person could not be convicted of more than one offense where one of the offenses is included in the other. However, the court then found that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.021.2 specifically allowed for punishment for second degree murder in addition to any punishment meted out for the commission of a related felony or attempted felony. Finding authority to punish for both crimes, and finding no error in the jury instructions, the court affirmed the convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant claimed that the statute was unconstitutional for vagueness. The court dismissed the appeal. Defendant did not preserve the constitutional issue for appeal because, although he raised the issue prior to trial, the record did not reflect that he filed a motion for new trial, as required by Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.11. To preserve a constitutional question for review four actions had to have occurred. First, the matter must have been raised at the first opportunity; second, the sections of the Constitution claimed to have been violated must have been specified; third, the point must have been preserved in the motion for new trial; and fourth it must have been adequately covered in the briefs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant pleaded guilty to attempting to commit sodomy and later sought to have the conviction vacated pursuant to Rule 24.035. The circuit court denied movant's motion, finding that the motion was untimely filed, and on movant's appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected movant's contention that Rule 24.035's absolute 90-day filing deadline was unconstitutional because the state's high court had previously rejected such a constitutional attack and the court was constitutionally controlled by that decision. Similarly, the court rejected movant's constitutional attack on Rule 24.035 that was based upon the fact that the rule had no savings clause. The remedy provided by Rule 24.035 existed only within the limits specified therein and contained no authority for an extension of time. By failing to file his motion to vacate within 90 days after delivery to the Department of Corrections, movant waived his right to proceed under Rule 24.035. Nor did movant's written request for &quot;shock probation&quot; toll the time period specified in Rule 24.035 because it did not attack movant's conviction or aver that his sentence exceeded the maximum authorized by law.</SPAN></P>

The court held that life imprisonment was an authorized punishment under &sect; 565.008.2, which provided for imprisonment of not less than 10 years. The court held that Mo. R. Crim. P. 272.6 was the legally proper procedure that was available to appellant and that he availed himself to that remedy. Further, the court held that appellant's quest for declaratory judgment was a guise for obtaining another review of an adjudicated claim. Moreover, the court held that appellant's allegations with regard to the disciplinary rule failed to plead a cause of action under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act in Chapter 527, Mo. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In granting respondent's motion for j.n.o.v., the trial court found that respondent was a public entity and was, therefore, protected by sovereign immunity. The court held that respondent was created as a private corporation, not in a fashion so as to constitute a department or administrative arm of government. It was administered by a private board of directors who were not responsible to or controlled by public officials or the general public. Respondent's contract with the city and county did not invest respondent with governmental powers or authority, even when the purpose of the contract was to serve public needs or welfare. Therefore, respondent was not a public entity for purposes of sovereign immunity. On respondent's cross appeal, the court held that the public duty doctrine did not apply. There was sufficient evidence of causation between the alleged acts of negligence and decedent's death to submit the issue to the jury. Respondeat superior did not apply because respondent's liability was not predicated solely upon the conduct of the nurse who was exonerated. The trial court did not err in submitting multiple acts under MAI 20.02.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment notwithstanding the verdict and reinstated the initial verdict with a reduction in the award amount.</SPAN></P>

Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 to vacate his conviction, per jury trial, of murder in the first degree. The conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. Movant was charged with capital murder in violation of Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a decision denying relief to movant in a proceeding under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 to vacate his conviction for murder in the first degree, the court affirmed. The court held that to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a prisoner seeking post-conviction relief must show (1) his lawyer failed to exercise the customary skill and diligence that a reasonably competent lawyer would have exercised under similar circumstances, and (2) the prisoner was thereby prejudiced. The court rejected movant's ineffective assistance of counsel arguments. Further, the record refuted any contention that movant was unable to understand the proceedings against him or assist his lawyer in his defense. Movant argued that he should have only received life imprisonment, since Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 559.009.3 provided that persons convicted of murder in the first degree were to be punished by imprisonment during their natural lives. Movant maintained the provision in the judgment that he was ineligible for parole until he had served 50 years of his sentence exceeded the maximum authorized by law, which was life imprisonment for first degree murder. The court rejected that argument.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in excluding a witness's statements that he was involved, in admitting other statements, in denying a motion to suppress, and in overruling challenges to the jury venire.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A supermarket was robbed by two gunmen. After getting money from the safe in bricks of one dollar bills and putting them in a plastic bag from the supermarket, one of the gunmen took a security guard's gun and shot the seven store employees in the head. Five died. Defendant was later found to have possessed the gun and also a bus pass that was taken from the safe. He was seen with a white plastic supermarket bag filled with one dollar bills. Affirming, the court held that the trial court did not err in excluding another suspect's statements against penal interest, because there were insufficient indicia of reliability of the statements: they were made to police rather than to friends, they were uncorroborated, and they were conflicting. Prior inconsistent statements of other witnesses were properly admitted. The trial court did not err in refusing to suppress a card case a detective picked up from the floor of defendant's room while he was searching for defendant with a warrant for his arrest. Although the indictment failed to give defendant notice that second degree felony murder instructions would be submitted, resulting in error, the error was not prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank was the successor to two other financial entities which had paid an intangible tax to the State under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 148.480 for a period of four years. Subsequently, the statute was declared unconstitutional, and institutions which had paid taxes under that statute could obtain a refund by following the procedures outlined in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;136.035 (1986). The trial court found that the bank failed to timely pursue the remedies under &sect; 136.035 and rejected its attempts to recover the taxes on the theory of wrongful taking property under Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 26. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the taxing of a citizen was not a taking or damage of private property within the meaning of the constitutional prohibition. The State never purported to act under the power of eminent domain when it collected the taxes under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 148.480 and the bank did not allege that the amount paid was paid for any reason except as the payment of taxes. The finding that &sect; 148.480 was unconstitutional did not convert the payment of taxes under that section to a taking under the power of eminent domain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The original billboard measured 320 square feet and was single-faced. The sign company obtained a permit for the sign in 1974. In 1976, the sign company attached a second face and requested a biennial inspection. The Commission did not renew the permit and issued a notice to remove the billboard because its size had been increased, in violation of the Commission's rules. Under the rule in effect in 1976, the sign company was given 30 days to take remedial action, which it did. The Commission sent a second notice in 1982, which gave as a violation that the size of the sign had been changed in 1976. The rule in effect in 1982 did not allow for remedial action. The Commission heard the case in 1983 and in 1989 ordered the sign company to remove the sign. The court reversed and remanded because the Commission's decision violated state law. The court found that the change in administrative rules between 1976 and 1982 was an unconstitutional ex post facto law under Mo. Const. art.

The instructor appealed to the circuit court, which upheld the board's decision. The instructor appealed. The court affirmed. The multiple roles of the board's attorney had not denied the instructor due process because the attorney had not participated in the deliberations or influenced the outcome.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant wanted a liquor license. The Supervisor determined that one applicant did not truthfully answer one question on the application, which asked if any member had ever been charged with, indicted for, or convicted of any federal or state law, because an investigation revealed that the applicant had been convicted and placed on probation. The Supervisor denied the application on the ground that it violated Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 70-2.020(8). The commission found that the applicant had entered a guilty plea to the charges and that his sentence had been suspended, and that based on those facts the answer on the application was false. In their petition for judicial review, the applicants relied on Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 610.110 (1986) to support their position that the answer was truthful. The circuit court reversed the judgment, and the Supervisor appealed. In affirming the judgment, the court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 610.105 retroactively applied to the applicant's suspended imposition of sentence, which operated to close his case, such that he could avail himself to the provisions of &sect; 610.110, which resulted in his answer to the application question being truthful.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and two men went to the elderly victim's home and told her that they were looking for termites and would make a free inspection of the house. They informed her that leaks in her attic needed to be sealed. They bought insulation and sealer for $ 110 and sealed the leaks. After looking in her checkbook and seeing that the victim's balance was $ 83,000, they told her that she owed them $ 3,680. The victim wrote them a check for $ 36, which they rejected. She then presigned a check, which one of the men filled out for $ 3,680. Defendant cashed the check. Defendant was convicted of stealing. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the evidence showed that defendant acting together with the two men appropriated the victim's money by deceit. The court noted that one of the men testified that they were involved in a fraud ring that targeted elderly people. The court found that defendant expected the victim to rely upon his false representation of value because of her age and condition. The court also found that if the victim had not relied upon the representation of value, she would not have relinquished her checkbook and consented to the payment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the employer's motion to dismiss, offset the employee's damages award, and denied the employer's motion for a new trial. The court affirmed. The court held that the employer's motion to dismiss was properly denied because forum non conveniens was viable in Missouri and the employer's ability to present its case in the forum was not impaired. The court held that the employer's motion for a new trial was properly denied because a juror's nondisclosure of her involvement in a lawsuit was innocent, the withdrawal instruction regarding the employer's expert's testimony was proper because it was based upon facts not in evidence and upon tests which did not duplicate the conditions that existed at the time of the accident, and the jury instruction on present value of the employee's future wages was required under FELA but the manner of computation was not an essential element of the employee's case. The court held that the set off was proper under 45 U.S.C.S. &sect; 55 even though the employer's parent company made the medical and disability payments.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was serving a life sentence on a conviction by the state for first-degree murder and had filed an unsuccessful application for parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant had served about 9 years of a life sentence for murder and was scheduled for a parole hearing, but the county prosecutor requested that the parole board correct its records to show that appellant would not be eligible for parole for a minimum of 50 years from the date of his conviction. The parole board required court authorization for the request, so the prosecutor filed a motion with the circuit court. The circuit court granted the motion. The prosecutor had not noticed appellant about the motion, and appellant did not learn about the order until he received a memorandum from the Department of Corrections. Thereafter, appellant filed a motion in which he protested the entry. The motion was denied, and this review followed. The court found that notice to appellant was not required for the correction of his sentence. However, even if the procedural complaint were resolved in favor of appellant, appellant would lose on the merits because the original judgment failed to comply with the mandate of law. Such a failure was a clerical error. Because the sentence was not authorized by law, it was not a final judgment and could be corrected nine years later.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that amended appellant's sentence to reflect that he would not be eligible for parole for 50 years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder after he stabbed his mother's boyfriend. Defendant filed an unverified motion under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.15 seeking to vacate, set aside, or correct his judgment or sentence. A verified amended motion was later filed. The trial court denied the motion for defendant's failure to verify his motion. Defendant appealed and claimed that the trial court erred in overruling his Batson challenge to the State's removal of six black and seven female venirepersons. The court originally held that Batson applied to gender-based peremptory strikes, and the court transferred the case to the Missouri Supreme Court. The State Supreme court retransferred the case back to the court. The court remanded to the trial court and held that defendant had standing to raise Batson challenges to the prosecutor's peremptory strikes on the basis of racial discrimination, but that Batson did not apply in cases of claimed gender discrimination. The court, though inclined to extend the application to gender discrimination, declined to do so based on the overwhelming weight of precedent that held that Batson applied no further than the parameters of racial discrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Affirming, the court held that although the commission's new rules increased the frequency of inspections, replacements, testing, record keeping, and other activities of gas utilities, including municipal gas utilities, with increased cost to the utilities but without appropriation from the state to pay the increased cost, the operation of the utilities was a discretionary function not required to be funded with tax dollars. Therefore, the rules were not prohibited by Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 21. It was reasonable for the commission to require gas utilities to inspect customer lines in the interest of public safety, and the commission acted within its statutory authority by so ordering. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 386.250(1) and (5); 386.250(6); 386.310; 386.310.1. The commission had statutory authority to adopt safety rules effective against public utilities in the interest of utility employees and customers. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 186.310.1 (Supp. 1990). The safety rules of the commission took precedent over conflicting municipal ordinances. The rule prohibiting customer ownership of service and yard lines was prospective and did not violate Mo.

The board filed a motion to dismiss on the basis that the landowner had not filed the action within 30 days of mailing of the final decision as required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.110.1. The trial court considered landowner's petition as an appeal or petition for review of a decision of the zoning board and granted the board's motion. The landowner appealed and claimed that the action was not an appeal or petition for review but rather a petition for declaratory relief that asserted that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 64.660 was unconstitutional and the zoning board was without jurisdiction to enter the decision complained of by the landowner. The court reversed the dismissal and held that the 30-day limitation did not apply because the petition was not for review of the order of the board on the merits, nor was it an appeal, and the landowner did not seek an administrative review.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to recall a previously issued mandate of the court, which affirmed defendant's convictions of possession of cocaine and possession of marijuana in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.020 (1986). Defendant argued that he was entitled to relief under the Comprehensive Drug Control Act of 1989, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.005 to &sect; 195.425 (Supp. 1990) as possession limited his maximum sentence to 7 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to recall the court's mandate alleged that his appellate counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel because counsel failed to move for a reduction in the 20-year sentence. Defendant contended that he was entitled to that relief under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1.160 (1986) because the new statutory sections amended &sect; 195.202 of the Comprehensive Drug Act and changed the offense for which he was convicted and limited the maximum punishment therefore to 7 years. The court rejected defendant's argument and denied his motion. The court noted that the new amended legislation did not involve reduction of punishment of an offense based on the same elements. The court also pointed out that the newly amended legislation did not constitute an amendment of the general statute that entitled defendant to relief. Further, the court found that the amended legislation did not help defendant because the punishment was assessed, the sentence was pronounced and the judgment was entered before the enactment of the new law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was the proposed construction of a covered stadium and supporting facilities to expand the convention center in downtown St. Louis City. The state, city, and county agreed to pay rent as tenants of a domed stadium and expanded convention center to be constructed by a statutorily created regional authority. The taxpayers filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief to stop the project. The taxpayers argued that the city and county could not enter into the agreement without first submitting it to a vote. On stipulated facts, the trial court ruled for the state officials. On appeal, the court affirmed holding that the proposed stadium was to be constructed by the Regional Convention and Sports Authority, which was authorized by statute and was a separate entity entirely. The court held further that any benefits to private persons under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 67.650-658 were incidental and did not take away from the primary purpose of legislation, which was to increase convention and sports activity in the St. Louis City-County area.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Director of Revenue sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Bollinger County (Missouri), which entered a summary judgment in favor of respondent driver and ordered the Director to reinstate the driver's motor vehicle operator's license. The Director revoked the license per Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 577.041.1 because the driver refused to submit to a chemical test of his breath after being arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court based its judgment on res judicata, holding that it was bound by a finding of another judge in a DWI case against the driver that the arresting officers had no reasonable cause to believe that the driver was driving a motor vehicle while in an intoxicated condition. On appeal, the court held that as there was no supporting affidavit for the driver's motion for summary judgment, there was no evidentiary basis for finding that there was no evidence supplying probable cause or reasonable grounds for the officers to believe the driver had operated his pickup in an intoxicated condition. The court held that even if another judge had decided that the arresting officer lacked reasonable grounds to believe that the driver was driving his pickup while in an intoxicated condition, such determination would have not been res judicata in the case. The court held that res judicata did not apply because the purpose of the administrative revocation of the driver's license was remedial, not to punish the driver, and thus, there was no identity of &quot;the thing sued for&quot; or &quot;the cause of action&quot; in the two proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment in favor of the driver and remanded to the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which sentenced him as a prior and persistent offender to six years of imprisonment after a jury found him guilty of first degree sexual abuse in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.100 (1986). Defendant also challenged the denial of his Mo. R. Crim. P. 29.15 motion without an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal defendant first argued that the trial court abused its discretion in giving Mo. Approved Instructions-Crim. 3d 312.10, the &quot;hammer&quot; instruction, followed with the statement &quot;would you retire and decide this case.&quot; The court held that there was no evidence that the jury was coerced into reaching its verdict. Defendant next asserted that the trial court erred in permitting a defense witness to invoke his privilege against self-incrimination. The court could not have said as a matter of law that the witness could not possibly incriminate himself by his expected testimony and therefore there was no error committed by the trial court. Defendant further contended that the trial court erred in allowing four people to testify to the victim's statements. The statutory authority for the admission of the statements, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491.075 (1986), was not unconstitutional and the statements had probative value apart from the victim's testimony. Finally, the court concluded that defendant failed to demonstrate prejudice resulting from his counsel's ineffectiveness and therefore there was no error in denying his Mo. R. Crim. P. 29.15 motion without a hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
