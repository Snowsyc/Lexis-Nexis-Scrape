<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff landowner sought to subdivide certain property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The landowner sought to subdivide certain property. The applicable zoning ordinance required each proposed lot to contain at least 30,000 square feet. Although the lots met this requirement, they did not have access to public sewer and water. The subdivision regulations required such lots to contain a minimum of one acre. The landowner argued that the planning and zoning commission, acting in its capacity as a planning commission, had no authority to enact and apply a subdivision regulation that required a larger minimum lot size than that set by the applicable zoning regulations. Affirming the rejection of the landowner's application, the court held that the landowner could not challenge the validity of the regulations in an action in which he had sought to take advantage of them. Rather, he was required to challenge them in a declaratory judgment action. The court applied the same rule applicable to zoning ordinances, although this was a subdivision ordinance, because like zoning regulations, the subdivision regulations were applied generally to the entire municipality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Three witnesses testified that they saw defendant encouraging a four-year-old child to touch his penis. The court upheld defendant's conviction. Although the trial court erred in failing to observe a sequestration order, defendant had not shown prejudice because a witness testified at a pretrial motion to dismiss. Thus, defendant could have exposed any fashioning of the witness' testimony to correspond to that of another witness. However, the inconsistencies were wholly explainable by reference to factors other than the order of their testimony. An amendment to the information was not substantive but merely charged two methods of committing the same crime and was thus properly permitted. The information, fairly read, charged defendant with conduct that was likely to impair the victim's morals, not with actually impairing the victim's morals, which was not within the proscription of &sect; 53-21. Although the trial court gave the jury an erroneous burden of proof for the process of drawing inferences from circumstantial evidence, it was not reasonably possible that the jury was misled by it because the jury did not actually draw the critical inference from circumstantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain, Geographical Area No. 12, which convicted him after a jury trial of manslaughter in the second degree with a motor vehicle while intoxicated, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-56b(a). Defendant's motion for reargument was denied. Considerable direct evidence was offered at trial regarding defendant's intoxication at the accident scene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to find that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-56b was void for vagueness; in charging the jury on &quot;intoxication;&quot; (3) in admitting results of an intoximeter test; and (4) in admitting certain photographs of the victim. Defendant claimed that the statute failed to adequately define the prohibited conduct as it did not define &quot;intoxication.&quot; The court held that &sect; 53a-56b was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant, whose conduct was clearly proscribed under any interpretation of the term. Nor was defendant denied due process by the jury instruction on intoxication. The instruction given, despite its similarity to instructions allegedly defining &quot;under the influence,&quot; was substantially similar to the definition approved by the Connecticut Supreme Court. While the trial court erred in instructing the jury regarding inferences to be drawn from the evidence, the error did not warrant reversal as the direct evidence on the issue of intoxication was substantial. Defendant failed to preserve the admissibility of the intoximeter test. Finally, the court found no abuse of discretion in the ruling admitting the challenged photographs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After a jury trial in the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Haven (Connecticut), defendant was found guilty of guilty of carrying a pistol without a permit.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A market clerk saw that defendant was carrying a gun. The clerk told a police officer who was in the market about the gun. The officer immediately left the market, and saw defendant walking quickly across the street. When defendant turned and saw the officer, he began to run. The officer stopped defendant and held him at gunpoint. A backup officer searched defendant, found live rounds in his pants pocket, and found the gun 20 feet from where defendant was stopped. At the time he was apprehended, defendant stated that he thought carrying a gun was alright as long as it was not loaded. Defendant argued that the officer lacked an articulable suspicion to support the initial detention, and that his statement was inadmissible because he was in custody and the officers failed to give him Miranda warnings. The conviction was affirmed. The court held that defendant's initial detention and the search were justified. The circumstances surrounding the stop and frisk constituted specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warranted the intrusion. The court also found that defendant's statement was spontaneous and voluntary.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the hearing. On review, defendant argued that he was entitled to the hearing and that under Conn. Gen.

The court rejected the arguments, finding that defendant merely made allegations and had not made the requisite showing of deliberate falsehood or of reckless disregard for the truth, and an offer of proof. The court refused to adopt the probable cause standard of &sect; 54-33f because it would create a new rule of law that would mandate a hearing every time a defendant made an allegation of untruthfulness in an affidavit.

The court set aside and remanded, holding that (1) the trial court erroneously concluded that the investigatory operation was illegal in design; (2) while the police had no more than a generalized suspicion of illegal conduct when they approached the restaurant, that suspicion became specific and focused on defendant when he ran into the restaurant in response to warnings that police had arrived; (3) the facts available to the police officer at the time of the pursuit were sufficient to justify a Terry investigative stop; and (4) the facts found by the trial court fully supported the conclusion, as a matter of law, that probable cause existed to believe that defendant illegally possessed narcotics and that he carried a pistol.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the jury could have reasonably concluded that defendant's display of a gun while accompanied by another man, coupled with defendant's request to &quot;see&quot; the lone victim's radio, was sufficient to conclude that through the use or threat of force defendant committed a robbery rather than a larceny. The court, however, found error in the trial court's instruction on circumstantial evidence because it unconstitutionally diluted the State's burden of proving every element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. The court concluded that the instruction allowed the jury to infer that defendant intended to communicate a threat by an erroneous &quot;more probable than not&quot; standard. While the court found that the evidence tending to prove that defendant threatened the victim with the use of force by displaying a gun was sufficient, the court concluded that the evidence was not so overwhelming that it rendered the instruction error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The victim was attacked one evening while she was walking along the highway. Her description of her assailant resulted in a composite picture that proved to be a remarkable likeness of defendant. The victim identified defendant from the third photo array that she was shown. His picture was not in the first two arrays. The police took the victim to the parking lot of defendant's employer, where she identified him exiting a van. Defendant challenged her out-of-court identification as impressively suggestive. The trial court denied his motion to suppress the identification. Because the testimony was conflicting as to whether the officers stopped talking when defendant's van arrived, the issue of credibility was for the trial court to determine. Finding no clear error, the court held that the evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that the identification procedure, while suggestive, was not impermissibly so. The court also found no error in the trial court's admitting evidence of defendant's flight.

Holding that the prosecutor's comments did not deny defendant a fair trial, the court affirmed the conviction. The prosecutor's references in closing argument to her personal ethics were improper when viewed in isolation, but were invited by defense counsel's accusation that the prosecutor was unethical. Further, the prosecutor's mention of the Fifth Amendment in closing was clearly a reference to the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and was not an improper comment on defendant's failure to testify. Finally, the complainant's testimony that she believed that the car was equipped with an anti-theft device, and thus could not be used without a key, was admissible even though it was based solely on the fact that her brother told her it was so equipped.

The husband's estate paid the succession tax on the entire value of the trust assets. Upon the death of the wife, the husband's executor's sought a recomputation of the succession tax. The tax was recomputed, based on the then certain fact that the assets had passed to the husband's children. The probate court found that the assets of the marital trust were taxable in the estate of the wife, the donee of the power of appointment. The trial court affirmed that finding and also found that the marital trust assets were includible in the estate of the husband, and that interest was due on the overpayment at the rate of four percent per annum.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants and two others were charged with the same crimes. One of the other men was acquitted and all of the State's witnesses in his trial testified at defendants' trial. Defendants claimed that the trial court erred in failing to order the State to produce the transcripts of the witnesses' testimony in the trial that ended in acquittal. The court held that defendants' constitutional rights of confrontation were violated by the trial court's refusal to conduct an in camera examination to determine if the transcripts in the trial that ended in acquittal contained material inconsistent statements of the witnesses sufficient to have affected the outcome of defendants' trials. Defendants' rights of confrontation outweighed the statute that required erasure of records after acquittal. The court remanded the case for an inspection to determine what, if any, of the prior testimony should be made available to defendants to preserve their constitutional rights. Also, there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court's failure to sever defendants' trials because there was no showing of manifest prejudice or substantial injustice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The injured party argued that &sect; 52-557g, which provided that land owners that made their property available to the public free of charge for recreational purposes owed no duty of care to the public, was unconstitutionally vague because it did not require the land owner to post on the property a notice that it was shielded from liability. The court rejected this argument because it did not attack the language of the statute. Specifically, the court noted that the injured party did not claim that the language would not permit a reasonable person of ordinary intelligence to know what was permitted or prohibited under the statute. The court concluded that, while the legislature could have required the type of posting suggested by the injured party, its failure to do so did not render the statute unconstitutionally vague, where the language was clear.</SPAN></P>

The department filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal because it was served more than 30 days after the notice was sent. The claimant argued that because the last day for service fell on a Sunday, when the United States postal service was not open to accept certified or registered mail, her service by certified mail on the next day was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of &sect; 4-183(b). The court disagreed, noting that the right to appeal from an administrative decision was purely statutory and was accorded only if the conditions fixed by the statute were met. The time limitations under &sect; 4-183(b) were not merely procedural limitations, but were essential parts of the remedy and were mandatory. Because the claimant did not strictly comply with &sect; 4-183(b), the trial court lacked jurisdiction and her appeal was properly dismissed. The court declined to consider the claimant's equal protection challenge because it was not raised at the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Defendant invited the victim back to his apartment ostensibly to check on his pets and have a nightcap. After they spent a short time in the apartment defendant physically and sexually assaulted the victim. The victim suffered blows to her face and body, which caused bleeding and bruises. Defendant knocked the victim to the floor, straddled her legs, pinned her arms down, punched her in the face, and attempted to undress her. He refused to let her leave the apartment and threatened her life. The victim ultimately escaped. Defendant was convicted of assault in the third degree, sexual assault in the third degree, and unlawful restraint in the first degree. Defendant's major assertion on appeal was that the lower court erred in its charge to the jury on the use of circumstantial evidence in making inferences. The court found error in part, set aside the judgment, and remanded for a new trial. The court held that it was reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the lower court's explanations regarding the use of circumstantial evidence about the ultimate burden of proof borne by the State.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed his conviction from the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford (Connecticut), for robbery in the first degree and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred (1) in failing to grant a motion to suppress identification testimony, (2) in refusing to grant a request for an in-court lineup, and (3) in failing to dismiss the charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred by failing to suppress all identification testimony that resulted from the roadside identification of him in a police car by a store customer who had observed defendant from the parking lot as he exited a building that had just been robbed. Although the customer's view of defendant was brief, his degree of attention was manifest in light of the fact that defendant was removing a stocking mask as he exited. The time interval between the view and the roadside identification was minimal and the certainty of the identification was positive. It was not error for the trial court to hold that the customer's identification was sufficiently reliable to warrant its admission into evidence. Also, because the in-court identification was not the product of an out-of-court confrontation &quot;conducive to irreparable misidentification,&quot; due process did not mandate an in-court lineup as a matter of right. Finally, there was no merit in the claim that the charges should have been dropped because the warrantless arrest was illegal. The court pointed out that an illegal arrest affected evidentiary rulings but imposed no jurisdictional barrier to prosecution.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court rejected the contention that the Board's alleged unreasonable delay in rejecting the sale of the property required a finding that the department had waived the requirement of approval by the Board. Because the Board rejected the sale of the property to the bidder for appropriate reasons, the court rejected the contention that the department failed to act in good faith in rejecting the bid.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The committee initiated a proceeding against the attorney by presentment of the attorney. The committee alleged improprieties with respect to the attorney's handling of a client's affairs. An assistant state's attorney, pursuant to &sect; 31, represented the committee. On the day the trial was to begin, the committee sought to amend the complaint. The trial court denied the motion, apparently having concluded that the state's attorney could only prosecute the committee's complaint rather than present an attorney in its own right. The court set aside the judgment. Grievance committees performed a necessary and valuable function by providing the courts with able and competent experts to investigate and evaluate claims of attorney misconduct. That delegation of power, however, was not a deprivation of power. The Superior Court retained inherent and plenary power to regulate and discipline its officers. It was error for the trial court to have concluded that the grievance committee could diminish that power.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed the judgment of conviction of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Danbury, Geographical Area Number Three (Connecticut), for two counts of sexual assault in the first degree. Among other claims, it was argued that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence the victim's out-of-court identification, and abused its discretion when it allowed direct examination of the victim in regard to prior sexual experience.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Prior to trial, defendant unsuccessfully moved to suppress evidence of a photographic array on the grounds that it was not reliable and that defendant's due process rights had been violated. On appeal, the court examined the State's exhibit A, which was the color photographic array at issue. The court found that the physiognomy of the seven persons photographed was remarkably similar. Even if the array was impermissibly suggestive, the victim's identification was sufficiently reliable to withstand challenge. The victim was able to closely observe defendant for over a minute while he walked with her along a lit sidewalk, and the victim was reasonably certain about her identification. It was error for the trial court to allow the introduction of the inherently prejudicial evidence of the victim's lack of prior sexual experience. However, defendant presented an alibi defense. Evidence of the victim's prior sexual relations could not have had any influence on the alibi defense. In the context of the overwhelming evidence of repeated sexual assaults, the court concluded that the one erroneous ruling was not sufficiently prejudicial to render it likely to affect the outcome of the case.</SPAN></P>

A jail witness testified that defendant disclosed that he could not be identified because he was completely covered. Defendant was convicted and appealed. Defendant challenged the trial court's jury instructions. The court held that the trial court's jury instruction on identity of defendant, and the use of circumstantial evidence in drawing inferences as to identity, was properly given in the charges concerning circumstantial evidence and were not given in relation to elements of the crime charged. In affirming the conviction, the court held that the trial court's failure to instruct on the definition of intent was not reversible error because defendant did not claim he did not have the requisite intent, but that he was not the perpetrator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was a passenger in a vehicle driven by another person. They got into a near collision with a taxi cab and an altercation ensured that involved defendant firing gunshots that caused injury to the taxi driver and passenger. Defendant and the driver were later apprehended by police and a firearm was found underneath the front seat of the car where defendant had been sitting. Defendant was tried and found guilty of two counts of the crime of assault in the first degree in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-59 (a)(1) and with the crimes of carrying a pistol without a permit and having a weapon in a motor vehicle in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-35. Defendant appealed. On review, the court determined that a showing was required that no one in the vehicle had a proper permit to possess or carry such a weapon. Therefore, if the driver had a proper permit to carry a pistol, defendant could not have been properly convicted. The State failed to establish that the driver lacked a valid permit, and therefore failed to prove an essential element of the crime alleged against defendant. For this reason, that conviction on this count was set aside.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction by finding that special instructions on the reliability of identification testimony was not needed due to the consistency of the eyewitness' testimony. The charge as to the duty to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt was proper. The court concluded that precedent showed that the &quot;near certitude&quot; language that defendant contended was needed as to the charge on the burden of proof was not required and that the charge did not encourage the jury to quantify the element finding process. The court also held that there was no need for defendant's requested charge on identification testimony because that testimony was not uncertain, unclear, or inconsistent. The court further found that defendant's claim of inconsistency as to his facial hair at the time of the robbery did not require more detailed instructions because the eyewitnesses were extensively cross-examined as to their ability to identify the robber.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that Conn. Gen.

Defendant also argued that her conviction could be set aside because the trial court abused its discretion when it set the particular conditions for her pretrial release. The court held that appellate review of a constitutional claim to pretrial release was not available after a conviction because the accused had no legal cognizable interest in the outcome of the appeal on that basis, absent the reasonable expectation or demonstrated probability that the same controversy involving the same defendant would recur.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Haven (Connecticut), where he was found guilty of one count of burglary in the first degree, two counts of attempt to commit assault in the first degree, two counts of reckless endangerment in the first degree, and one count of theft of a firearm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant and a co-defendant were observed entering a attached garage carrying pillow cases. Defendant accosted people inside the house and fled, firing shots. Several people, including police officers, identified defendant after seeing him flee the scene. The co-defendant also testified against defendant, who was charged and found guilty on counts of burglary, attempted assault, reckless endangerment, and theft of a firearm. On appeal, defendant asserted that the trial court erred in allowing into evidence the identification testimony of a witness and a police officer. Defendant also asserted error in the manner in which the trial court commented on the evidence. On review, the court found that a witness's spontaneous identification of defendant as he sat at counsel table just prior to trial was admissible and did not taint a later in-court identification because the encounter was not pre-arranged by law enforcement agents. The trial court did not improperly comment on the evidence by stating that defendant shot &quot;point blank&quot; at a police officer while fleeing. The jury charge, as a whole, fairly and correctly presented the case to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff, a 14-year-old girl, filed a product liability action against the retailer after she was injured by a riding mower that had been sold by the retailer. The jury awarded damages to plaintiff. The retailer appealed and plaintiff filed a cross-appeal. Plaintiff contended that the trial court erred by failing to charge the jury on her claim for punitive damages. The court found that the retailer's failure to install a deadman's control on the lawnmower, when such devices were not universally accepted by the industry and were not required under applicable safety standards at the time the retailer's machine was distributed, and its reliance on the product manufacturer for safety testing did not rise to the level of reckless conduct. Without the required showing of recklessness, there was no basis for the jury to consider an award of punitive damages against the retailer. However, the court found that the retailer had a duty to adequately warn plaintiff of its failure to install a deadman's control on the lawnmower.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 53-21, arguing that the superior court erred in instructing the jury on the two types of conduct proscribed by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;53-21 where he was charged with only one type.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant committed a sexual act upon his girlfriend's nine-year old daughter and was charged with sexual assault in the first and risk of injury to a minor. Defendant was convicted of both charged offenses. He appealed, challenging the superior court's jury instructions. In setting aside defendant's conviction for the offense of risk of injury to a minor, the court concluded that because defendant was only charged with one of the two types of behavior proscribed by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21, the superior court erred in instructing the jury on both types of proscribed conduct. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21 proscribed (1) deliberate indifference to or the creation of situations that could harm a minor's moral or physical welfare and (2) acts directly perpetrated on the minor and injurious to her moral or physical well-being. Defendant was only charged with committing the latter, but from the very beginning of trial, the superior court invited the jury to consider both the charged and the uncharged portions of the statute. This created a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled by the superior court's instructions and mandated a new trial on this charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">There was error as to the risk of injury count only. The judgment finding the defendant guilty of risk of injury to a minor was set aside, and the case remanded for a new trial on that count.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Fairfield (Connecticut) finding him guilty of two counts of burglary in the first degree in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-134(a)(4) and two counts of unlawful restraint in the third degree in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-95(a). Points of error included issues surrounding defendant's identification and the increase of his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">During investigation of a burglary in which two victims were tied up, the victims viewed photographic arrays. About four months later, one victim picked out defendant's photo and identified him in court. The other victim was unable to identify defendant from photos but identified him in court. The identification procedures were not unnecessarily suggestive or unreliable based on a totality of the circumstances. An expert's testimony about the dangers of misidentification was properly excluded. Reliability of eyewitness identification was common knowledge and the testimony would not have assisted the jury in resolving the issue. Three days after sentencing defendant, the trial court recalled and resentenced him. Because the original sentence was legal, the trial court could not correct it under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book &sect; 935. After the sentence began, the trial court had no authority to modify it. Denial of defendant's motion for mistrial was not an abuse of discretion where defendant was presented with possibly exculpatory information at trial. He declined the trial court's offer of a continuance, effectively precluding inquiry into whether the information was exculpatory or not.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found error in part. The judgment was set aside and the case was remanded with direction to render judgment as on file except that the original sentence imposed was to be reinstated.</SPAN></P>

Defendant admitted to the officer that the device was a radar detector. Defendant moved to dismiss at the close of the State's case on the ground that there was no evidence that the device was installed or that he was the person who had installed it. The court held that the trial court's findings that the device was located on the dashboard in front of defendant, that he was aware of its presence, and that it was positioned in such a way that its purpose could be fulfilled encompassed each aspect of the offense of installation of a radar detector. The court noted that an administrative ruling had clarified the meaning of the term &quot;installed&quot; as used in Conn. Agencies Regs. &sect; 14-137-1 by providing that the term referred to a device that was so affixed or situated that it was capable of being activated by the operator of a vehicle while driving.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court held that the trial court did not err in denying his motion for a mistrial and in failing to give the jury a cautionary instruction after the State questioned a witness called by defendant to verify that he was validly asserting his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The court held that the trial court erred in permitting an amendment of the information charging defendant with second-degree larceny to be superseded by a charge of third-degree larceny. The court held that the trial court's decision permitting the jury to be instructed as to third-degree larceny was an error that unconstitutionally deprived defendant of his rights to a fair trial and to adequate notice of the charges against him. The court therefore vacated defendant's conviction of third-degree larceny. The court further held, under the plain error rule, that defendant was improperly convicted of two counts of conspiracy arising out of a single agreement. The court set aside both conspiracy convictions, and remanded the case for the application of the trial court's discretion in determining which conspiracy was proved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed the judgment of conviction from the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford (Connecticut), for sexual assault in the first degree and robbery in the first degree. From the denial of his motion to set aside the verdict, defendant raised claims of error that addressed, among other areas, an out-of-court identification, and the failure to give an adverse inference jury instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the court found that the circumstances justified an immediate one-on-one viewing of defendant by the victim because the victim's family had appeared at defendant's residence to confront him. The situation was potentially volatile and the police were obliged to defuse it. Even if it had been found that the process was overly suggestive, the identifications were still admissible because they were reliable. The victim had a good and sufficient opportunity to view defendant at the time of the assault at close range and with adequate lighting. Defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction to the effect that an unfavorable inference could be drawn against the State for its failure to furnish the testimony of the boyfriend of the victim's daughter. The boyfriend was not shown to be a person the State would have naturally produced as one possessing superior or unique knowledge material to the case. As to the sufficiency of evidence challenge, the victim's testimony, which was believed by the jury, was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant compelled her to engage in sexual intercourse by use of force, and also that he robbed her of money and jewelry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Decedent was involved in a complicated multi-vehicle accident that occurred on an icy area of the interstate. While helping her mother exit her damaged car, decedent was struck by the driver's vehicle and received injuries that resulted in her death 45 days later. After the administrator settled with other defendants, the negligence case proceeded against the driver. Finding the driver negligent, the jury rendered a verdict for the administrator in an amount that reflected decedent's comparative negligence of 20 percent. Finding credible evidence from which the jury could reasonably have found that the driver was negligent and the proximate cause of the accident resulting in decedent's injuries and death, the court upheld the verdict. Because the rescue doctrine applied under Connecticut's comparative negligence statute, the administrator's recovery was not barred, but merely reduced, by decedent's negligence in attempting to rescue her mother. Moreover, the testimony of the administrator's expert was admissible. The amount of damages did not shock the court's sense of justice so as to compel the conclusion the jury was influenced by ignorance, partiality, prejudice, or corruption.</SPAN></P>

The father contended that the award of attorney's fees was excessive in light of the statutory criteria to be employed by the trial court for such awards. The court found that the trial court had before it evidence relating to those criteria, and additionally, in setting reasonable attorney's fees, testimony from the mother, corroborated and detailed by her counsel, regarding their fee arrangement, the hours devoted by counsel to this matter, and his hourly rate. Under the circumstances, the court did not conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in making its award of reasonable counsel fees in the amount of $ 5,200 based upon 52 hours of legal work at the reasonable hourly rate of $ 100. The financial criteria upon which the unquestioned award of support was based equally established the mother's entitlement to her award of counsel fees supported by the same statutory criteria.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that a statutory exception authorizing defendant to possess cocaine was not an essential element of the offense unless and until defendant introduced substantial evidence of the applicability of the exception to him. The only evidence presented, that defendant was a physician, was alone insufficient to establish that the statutory exception was an essential element of the offense. The court found that defendant was not deprived of the opportunity to prepare a defense strategy by the trial court's denial of his motion for a bill of particulars. The record indicated that defendant was adequately informed of the specific offenses and of the dates, times, and places where the offenses allegedly occurred. He was also given the identity of an informant and was permitted to test the cocaine given to an undercover officer.

Defendant asserted several assignments of error.

The court reasoned that if a probable cause hearing had been held on the murder charge and no probable cause had been found, the State would still have been able to proceed on the lesser-included offense without a probable cause hearing. The court determined that the trial court did not err when if failed to charge the jury at defendant's request regarding defendant's flight from the scene. The court stated that the charge given was an accurate restatement of the law.

Under the standard of review applied to sufficiency of the evidence claims, the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find the essential elements of the crime charged proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-49 and 53a-70. The record showed that the victim, a female, was returning home from college on a bus when she discovered that the bus terminal was closed. Defendant, who was standing outside the terminal, told the victim to follow him if she wanted to get a taxi. Once they arrived at the rear of the terminal, defendant pushed the victim against a doorway and held her by the head and neck as well as by the mouth. Defendant, who repeatedly told the victim that he didn't want money, told the victim that he was going to &quot;fuck her up a lot of times.&quot; The victim was able to get away before anything further happened. On appeal, the court found that the trial court properly denied is motion for a judgment of acquittal because, given the circumstances surrounding the incident, defendant's actions, and his graphic statement of purpose for apprehending the victim, the court concluded that the jury could reasonably have found defendant's intent was specifically to commit sexual assault in the first degree. Accordingly, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of the possession of heroin with the intent to sell in a trial in which his motion to suppress was denied. The court affirmed that conviction, finding that there was adequate probable cause for a warrant to search defendant's home and that the premises to be searched was described with adequate particularity. The court reasoned that the warrant included a detailed description of the building in which defendant's apartment was located and that it directed the executing officer to the affidavit, which contained many references to defendant's apartment. The court also held that the fresh, first-hand information that the unlawful conduct earlier disclosed was still taking place at the premises clearly supplemented and revitalized the &quot;stale&quot; information that was included in the affidavit. The court further found that the warrant was timely executed because the delay between the warrant's issuance and the execution was within the period that was allowable under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-33c and because the general nature of the drug trade and the manner in which defendant operated provided credible evidence that the illegal acts were of a continuing nature.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the delay caused no prejudice to defendant. To establish that a pre-arrest delay had caused a denial of the right to due process of law, defendant had to establish a specific showing of prejudice. The court also found that defendant was charged, tried, convicted, and sentenced under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 19-480 (a) without reference at any time to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 19-480 (b). The court could not find error in the trial court's conclusion that the statutes were not ambiguous as they pertained to the proscribed conduct, that defendant was provided fair warning, and that defendant's right to equal protection of the law was not violated.</SPAN></P>

As to defendant's claim of error based on the trial judge's refusal to disqualify himself, the court held that it was precluded from considering the issue because at no time did defendant file a written motion to recuse, an affidavit setting forth factual allegations, or a certificate of good faith by counsel as mandated by Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. App. P. &sect; 997. The court denied defendant's free-speech argument and held that insulting or fighting words, which by their very utterance inflicted injury or tended to incite an immediate breach of the peace, were not protected speech.

The city appealed the ZBA's decision to the Superior Court. Plaintiff taxpayers did not join in the appeal. The city's appeal was withdrawn. The taxpayers then brought an independent action against the property owner, the city, and two city employees seeking an injunction, a declaratory judgment and damages claiming that the construction would cause deterioration of their neighborhood and decrease the value of their homes. The trial court dismissed the action, and on appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the proper procedure would have been for the taxpayers to have joined the appeal from the decision of the ZBA under Conn.

The parcel was nonconforming because it was smaller than the minimum lot size. The individual had a mobile home on the land, which replaced the first mobile home. While the first mobile home was on the property the commission enacted a regulation which prohibited the owner of a mobile home from making more than one replacement of the home. The individual applied for permission to replace her the second mobile home with a third mobile home of equal size, but the commission denied her request. The court held that by depriving the individual of the opportunity to replace her mobile home a second time, the town was depriving her of a vested property right in a nonconforming use without just compensation. The court noted the individual's nonconforming use of the property would not change with replacement of her second mobile home, merely the home would change. The court made the observation that the zoning regulations were written to seek the termination of a valid nonconforming use after a &quot;grace period&quot; of one mobile home replacement, and noted that under state law they had to fall.</SPAN></P>

The victim and the witness reported the incident to the police and identified defendant when he was arrested. At trial, the victim and the witness made in-court identifications of defendant, and the state introduced evidence of their out-of-court identifications. On review, the court found that the witness gave uncontroverted testimony that he identified defendant spontaneously as defendant entered the police station. Consequently, the identification was not tainted and defendant's due process rights were not violated by the admission of the evidence. As to the victim, the court found the show-up was unnecessary and suggestive, but based on the degree of certainty displayed by the victim and the length of time between the crime and the confrontation, the identification was reliable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In an action for the dissolution of a marriage, the husband and the wife sought review from the judgment of the trial court. The trial court awarded joint custody of the parties' minor child to the parties, if the condition of behavioral modification of the husband were met in the future. The wife argued that it was error for the trial court to conclude that joint custody was in the best interests of the child. The court held that joint custody could not be an alternative to a sole custody award where neither party sought it and where no opportunity was given to the recalcitrant parent to embrace the concept. Further, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-56a(b) contained no additional subsection providing for a procedure in the event neither parent sought joint custody. The court held that the trial court erred in awarding joint custody, subject to proof of the meeting of certain conditions by the husband, at a future time, absent an agreement by the parties, or absent a motion by one of them for conciliation after a motion had been made seeking joint custody.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court held that there was error in part; thus, the court set aside the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case with directions to render judgment as on file, except that those portions of the judgment relating to joint custody and to orders concerning discipline and hygiene of the child as they related to the wife were to be omitted.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that defendant's request for an evidentiary hearing was not made in the context of a challenge to the admissibility of the evidence of identification.

Defendant challenged the warrant and the information contained in the underlying affidavit as unconstitutionally stale. He contended further that probable cause was lacking under the totality of circumstances test, and that the description of the place to be searched lacked constitutional particularity. The court affirmed. The confidential informant provided evidence that revitalized the information made within 90 days, bringing the earlier statements to date and removing any staleness. Applying the totality of the circumstances test, and reading the affidavit in a common sense manner, the court concluded that the affidavit passed muster in that it gave objective evidence of a fair probability that proscribed activity was occurring at the premises and that drugs were located there. The search of the entire premises, including defendant's bedroom, pursuant to the warrant, was valid.</SPAN></P>

At the end of the process, defendant read and signed the document, after deleting a phrase. The trial court found that defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights prior to the giving of his statement. The court disagreed and set aside the trial court's judgment. The court found that the record was devoid of any evidence that defendant understood his signature on the notification form represented his intentional relinquishment of a known right or privilege, and that the record disclosed no evidence of an affirmative act of waiver after Miranda warnings were read. The court noted that defendant was born, raised and educated to age 16 in Jamaica and had difficulty communicating with counsel and the court and that there was no indication that defendant was at all familiar with interrogation procedures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The son and his siblings were removed from the mother's custody based on reported child abuse. Over the next seven years, numerous attempts to place the son back with his mother were unsuccessful, resulting in the Commissioner's petition. Based on testimony from a psychiatrist, a developmental evaluator, and the son's foster mother, the superior court found that the mother, by reason of continuing mental deficiency, had been unable to provide the son with the care necessary to his well being, and that the deficiency would continue for such time as would be detrimental to the son. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found the judgment legally correct and factually supported. The court held that testimony of a child psychologist as to the son's psychological and behavioral problems in the fault stage of the proceedings was relevant to the mother's ability to deal effectively with her child, but in any event, the other evidence was overwhelming. The court found that the Commissioner met the burden of proof under &sect; 17-43a(b)(3), which met the Yoder criteria and satisfied constitutional due process requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The dismissal was based on the lack of probable cause for the issuance of the warrant, the state's failure to prove a violation of Conn.

On appeal, the state claimed that the court erred in each of these conclusions and that the information should be reinstated. The court agreed. The court noted that probable cause for a warrant required that the affidavit, read in a common sense manner, gave objective evidence of a fair probability that proscribed activity occurred. On this basis, the court concluded that the affidavit sufficiently established probable cause. The court also found that the superior court erred in dismissing the information, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-56, for lack of evidence because the affidavit presented as the basis for probable cause was not intended and did not constitute the state's entire evidence. Finally, the court found that the superior court erred in concluding that the communications were protected free speech because the meager factual record precluded the superior court from making a proper decision on that constitutional basis.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the commissioner's request to strike the complaint due to a lack of standing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The insured alleged that her insurance policy with the insurer contained an arbitration provision and that the insurer had refused to arbitrate. The insurer argued that the superior court erred by refusing to dismiss the complaint on the basis of the lack of a recognizance. The insurer contended that the insured's complaint was a &quot;civil action&quot; that required a recognizance pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book &sect;&sect; 51, 52, 53. The court found that because a proceeding under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-410 did not follow the pattern of an ordinary civil action, it could not be seen as a civil action for purposes of discovery and pleading. Therefore, the discovery process as set out in the Connecticut Practice Book was not applicable to proceedings under &sect; 52-410. The court held that the insurer was not entitled to compliance with its discovery requests or a ruling on them before the insured's claim was adjudicated. However, the court concluded that in an action to compel arbitration under an insurance policy clause, the issue of coverage was an antecedent question for the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court held that the superior court erred by ordering that the issue of coverage be decided by arbitration. As to the other grounds of the insurer's appeal, the court found no error.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, plaintiffs contended, inter alia, that the trial court erred in concluding the Town had had the statutory authority to pass the ordinance. The court affirmed. The court stated that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21-37, which provided that a town might make reasonable ordinances with respect to vending upon its public streets, was not in conflict with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-148 (c)(7)(H)(iv), which stated that any municipality had the power to prohibit and regulate the business of peddlers in a manner not inconsistent with the general statutes. The court concluded that the Town possessed the statutory authority to prohibit vending from motorized vehicles. The court further found that (1) the trial court did not err in finding that the ordinance was a reasonable exercise of the Town's police powers; and (2) the ordinance was not violative of the Due Process, Equal Protection, and Commerce Clauses of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The landowners' property, which they purchased for use as a landfill, was condemned by the town and the landowners were awarded compensation in a prior proceeding. Before the condemnation took place, the legislature passed the Inland Wetlands and Water Courses Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 22a-36 through 22a-45, which classified the land as an inland wetland, and the town passed two zoning regulations, which required a permit for filling operations. The landowners did not apply for a permit and did not challenge the designation of their land as a wetland. In the current litigation, the landowners complained that these regulations so affected the value of their land from the date they were instituted until the date of condemnation as to amount to an unconstitutional taking. The trial court ruled in favor of the town and its officials. In affirming, the court held that the landowners could not seek what they had already unsuccessfully sought in the prior litigation, a higher price for their land. The court found no justification for an independent action, which sought, in essence, only to relitigate the issues of the prior suit.</SPAN></P>

The Commission retained two dentists to evaluate his work. At the hearing, both of their reports were introduced into evidence over the dentist's hearsay objection. The dentist acknowledged that the conclusions in the reports were correct regarding his billing and dental work, so the Commission suspended his dental license for two six-month periods. The dentist appealed, and the trial court dismissed his action. On appeal, the court held that the reports were made by dentists with no bias or interest in the case, were based on personal consultation and examination, and contained no facial inconsistency. Because they did not substantially prejudice the dentist, who failed to have the evaluating dentists subpoenaed, the court concluded that the reports were admissible. The court also held that the dentist had been given notice of the case against him and an opportunity to be heard by a fair and impartial body, so his due process rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The widows, in separate actions, sought death benefits for their husbands under &sect; 7-433c. The Commissioner denied their claims and the widows appealed. The court consolidated the appeals and held that the first widow was not entitled to benefits under &sect; 7-433c because her husband died six years prior to the enactment of &sect; 7-433c and it had no retroactive effect. Additionally, the newest enactment of &sect; 7-433c did more than merely restate rights that had existed since 1959, it conferred benefits that had not already been established. The second widow argued that to qualify for benefits under &sect; 7-433c, only the condition of hypertension or heart disease need be suffered while on duty or off duty by a regular member of a police department. The court found that &sect; 7-433c provided that both the condition of hypertension or heart disease and the death resulting from the condition had to be suffered while the individual was on or off duty as a regular member of a police or fire department. Unlike a police officer on active status, the second widow's husband could not have been injured in the line of duty because he was retired; thus, he did not meet the eligibility requirements of &sect; 7-433c.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed his conviction for failure to appeal, arguing that the trial court erred: (1) in finding that the evidence of willfulness was sufficient; (2) in penalizing defendant for not pleading guilty; and (3) in its charge to the jury. The court held that the proof of willfulness depended on inferences reasonably drawn from the direct evidence presented by the State, particularly the testimony elicited from the interviewing probation officer, which indicated that defendant received unambiguous notice of the court date. Simply because defendant received a harsher penalty than his co-defendant, who pled guilty, did not mean that defendant was penalized for exercising his constitutional rights because co-defendants were not without variance and did not need, in terms of punishment, to be treated similarly because they were rarely, if ever, exactly similar. The trial court's charge was legally correct and was presented the case to the jury in a just and fair manner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The fund received tentative approval for the construction of night lights to illuminate the town's high school athletic field, which was located in a residential area, from the ZEO. The ZEO found the lighting facilities were not in conformity with the town's zoning ordinance, Saybrook, Conn., Zoning Regs. &sect; 61.1, and issued a cease and desist order. The lights were not permitted to be turned on. The fund filed an action for a declaratory judgment challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 61.1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In 1979, the board voted to terminate the teacher for moral misconduct after a hearing panel recommended to reprimand and suspend him. The teacher filed an administrative appeal and the termination was set aside because he was deprived of due process. The board held multiple meetings on the termination. At a meeting on July 26, 1982, the teacher challenged the board's jurisdiction and refused to present argument. The board then voted to terminate his contract. The teacher filed an appeal, which was tried with his action for wrongful discharge. The trial court dismissed the administrative appeal, but granted him damages on his wrongful termination claim. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the administrative appeal and reversed the judgment in the wrongful termination action. Contrary to the order in the first administrative appeal, the teacher's termination by the board in 1979 did not violate his due process rights. The procedure gave him the full opportunity to meet the case against him and to present his own case. Therefore, he was not wrongfully discharged. The law of the case doctrine did not apply due to an intervening United States Supreme Court decision.</SPAN></P>

The court did hold that the landowner followed the proper procedure for challenging the constitutionality of the zoning regulation by seeking declaratory relief. The court held that the regulation, Woodbridge, Ct., Zoning Reg. &sect; 3.43, which dealt with property that had been unintentionally landlocked, was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The case began as an administrative appeal to the trial court pursuant to the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 4-166-4-189, and by agreement of the parties and the trial court, became a vehicle for deciding an issue not within the scope of the administrative proceedings. Because neither the parties nor the trial court had the power to make such a change, the court sustained the judgment of the trial court dismissing the appeal of the landowners. On appeal, the landowners claimed that the DOT had no power to close the railroad crossing because that power was lodged solely in the federal secretary of transportation pursuant to federal statutes, and the trial court erred by finding that the landowners had not established a right of way by necessity over the crossing. The landowners appealed to the trial court from the DOT's letter referring to a decision directing the closing of the crossing. To the extent that the trial court exercised its jurisdiction over the landowners appeal from a decision other than a final decision pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-183 (a), it exercised jurisdiction, which it did not have, and the landowners' appeal was dismissable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff, a no-fault insurer, appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford (Connecticut), which, on summary judgment, limited its reimbursement recovery against defendants, the insured and his attorney, to $ 5,000 in policy proceeds awarded for which the insured also received proceeds from a judgment against the tortfeasor's insurance company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The no-fault insurer claimed that it paid benefits in excess of the policy limits, based on regulatory required increased coverage. The insurer further claimed that the attorney improperly disbursed the judgment funds, thus violating the insurer's rights to the funds. On appeal, the court found that, although Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 38-320(a), (d), appeared to limit recover of basic reparations benefits to $ 5,000, based on the language, history, and purpose of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 35-325(b), the entire amount of required benefits paid constituted basic reparations benefits, which were subject to reimbursement and lien rights. The court found that the superior court erred in striking one of the attorney's asserted special defenses that asserted that the insurer waived its lien rights by a letter by failing to make demand, by failing to give notice of enforcement, and by failing to enforce its claim prior to the disbursement of funds from the tortfeasor's insurer. The court remanded for determination of that issue and concluded that the motion for summary judgment should have been granted to the full extent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found error and set aside the judgment. The court remanded the case with direction to render judgment for the insurer for the full amount of the claim against the insured and the attorney, unless he were able to establish his special defense in a hearing limited to that issue.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the jury instructions did not deprive defendant of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial. The court held that the introduction of defendant's prior sexual misconduct was proper because defendant had introduced the testimony. The court held that defendant was not entitled to an acquittal for a discrepancy in the specific hour charged in the information because it was irrelevant to the defense presented.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In a consolidated action, plaintiffs, a decedent's heirs and an executor of one heir's estate, appealed the judgment of the Superior Court in the judicial district of New Haven (Connecticut), which determined that a mortgage note and bank accounts belonged to defendant executor, who held the accounts and note jointly with a right of survivorship with the decedent, who was the executor's mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Claiming the existence of a constructive trust of all joint assets, plaintiffs instituted an equitable action against the executor individually. The trial court concluded that plaintiffs failed to sustain the burden of proof necessary to establish a constructive trust of the assets and that the language of the decedent's will, which directed the executor to provide for plaintiffs at his earliest discretion, was precatory in nature. On appeal the court found that plaintiffs were required to prove a fiduciary relationship between the decedent and the executor before the executor was required to prove fair dealing or the absence of undue influence. Plaintiffs failed to prove a fiduciary relationship and failed to overcome the presumption that the title to the assets in the joint accounts vested in the executor as the survivor as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 36-3. Because the joint accounts held the decedent's only assets and they passed to the executor as the survivor, nothing remained to pass under the will. Even if that was not true, the decedent's will left it to the executor's discretion to provide for plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The widow filed a claim and the employer did not file a notice of intent to contest the claim within 20 days as required by Conn.

The Division entered a finding of compensability on the basis of &sect; 31-297(b) and found that the employee's death did not arise out of and in the course of his employment. Defendants contended that &sect; 31-297(b) was unconstitutional. The court held that the exclusive compensability, where the employer did not contest liability within 20 days of written notice, did not violate the employer's right to procedural due process and equal protection of the laws. The court held that a presumption of law had to be based upon facts of universal experience and be controlled by inexorable logic. The court concluded that the purpose of &sect; 31-297(b) was to correct some of the glaring inequities and inadequacies of the Workmen's Compensation Act. Thus, the court concluded that defendants failed to meet their burden of proving that &sect; 31-297(b) was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, the court held that defendants were precluded from contesting the finding that the employee's death arose out of and in the course of his employment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The mother sought arrearages in child support from the father. The father cross-claimed, arguing that he was entitled to a portion of the wrongful death settlement the mother received arising from the death of their son. The trial court granted the mother summary judgment. On appeal, the court held that the Georgia wrongful death statute, which controlled the wrongful death action, had changed between the time of the son's death and when the wrongful death judgment was finalized. One of the main changes in the wrongful death statute was who could recover. Under O.C.G.A. &sect; 105-1307, in effect when the son was killed, only the mother, if living, could recover for a minor's wrongful death. As amended, O.C.G.A. &sect; 74-108(b) provided for a shared recovery between the parents of a decedent minor. Section 74-108(b) did not state that it was to be applied retrospectively; thus, the trial court was correct in finding that &sect; 74-108 did not apply. While there was Georgia case law that stated that &sect; 74-108 had retrospective effect, the father failed to point the trial court to the case, and the trial court could not be expected to undertake an original examination of foreign law.</SPAN></P>

The trial court awarded damages to the landowners for the increased costs of developing their realty that it found were causally connected to the errors in the site plan. On appeal, the court held that but for the surveyor's negligence, the owners would not have had to comply with the conditions imposed by the Town to obtain a zoning change. The surveyor was not found negligent without expert testimony as to its standard of care, and the owners property taxes were properly awarded as damages. The court concluded that the facts found were supported by the evidence and were not clearly erroneous. It was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to determine that the statutory eight percent interest rate that became effective in 1979 applied to the money due the landowners from the survey since 1973.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Haven, Geographical Area Number Six (Connecticut) of criminal impersonation, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-130. On appeal, he argued that the trial court erred in ruling that his presence was required during the trial, in denying his motion to dismiss and his motions for judgment of acquittal, and in failing to charge as defendant requested.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Driving down a state highway, defendant pulled alongside a female driver, flashed a badge, and pointed at her. When she stopped, defendant again flashed the badge and warned her about speeding. On appeal, the court held that Conn. Gen. Prac. Book &sect;&sect; 967, 968, and 969 substantiated the proposition that there was no right of absence of a defendant from his criminal trial. Reference to Fed. R. Crim. Proc. 43 confirmed that conclusion. Thus, the trial court did not violate any constitutional right in requiring that defendant be present. The court held that the term &quot;public servant&quot; was adequately defined and &sect; 53a-130(a) provided a reasonable degree of certainty as to the conduct prohibited. Section 53a-130(a) was not unconstitutionally vague and the motion to dismiss was properly denied. Defendant's motion for acquittal was also properly denied; the State met its burden of proving the negative fact that he was not a public servant at the time of the offense. Defendant's contention that the State was required to prove which specific public servant defendant was impersonating was baseless. The trial court's charge as to the term &quot;public servant&quot; was sufficient for the jury's guidance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court of Connecticut, Judicial District of New Haven, which convicted him, upon his plea of nolo contendere, of assault in the third degree and breach of the peace. He claimed the trial court erred by denying his motion for accelerated rehabilitation, which he made prior to the entry of his plea. His appeal from the denial of the motion had been dismissed because there was no final judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court noted that, upon entering a plea of nolo contendere, defendant waived certain constitutional rights, including the right to assert the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to require the State to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. He also waived all nonjurisdictional defects and all defenses. After such a plea, he was limited in the claims he could make on appeal. He could not raise claims of constitutional violations occurring before his plea, although he could attack the voluntary or intelligent character of his plea. The court held that defendant could not appeal the denial of an application for accelerated rehabilitation after pleading nolo contendere. His plea was made without reservation. He made no claim that his plea was not voluntarily and intelligently made. He had waived almost all rights he might have had prior to the entry of his plea. Further, the denial of an application for accelerated rehabilitation was not equal to a deprivation of a constitutional right. Accelerated rehabilitation was a statutory alternative to the traditional course of prosecution available for some defendants and dependent upon the trial court's discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A police officer for a city suffered a back injury in the course of his employment and applied for disability benefits pursuant to a pension agreement adopted by the city. The board denied the officer's application. The officer sued the board for an injunction ordering the board to grant his application, and the trial court granted the board's motion to dismiss the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. Although there was no statutory procedure for an appeal from the board's decision, the officer's complaint included an allegation that the board breached the pension agreement. Thus, the trial court had jurisdiction over the breach of contract claim. The pension agreement was incorporated into the city's code of ordinances, and City of Danbury, Conn., Code of Ordinances &sect; 14-59 provided for six-year limitations period for filing an action based on the agreement. Even without a statutory right of appeal, the trial court had jurisdiction over the officer's allegations that the board's action deprived him of his constitutional right of due process and equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The victim was unable make any identification from the photo array. The defendant objected to the photo array on the basis that several of the photographs showed individuals much heavier than him and either much older or younger. The defendant also objected because some of the photos had names on them which were not Pete or Peter. The witness made an in-court identification of the defendant. The defendant was convicted. The court affirmed finding that even though the identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive, the identification itself was nevertheless reliable in light of the totality of the circumstances. The court held the use of the defendant's photograph was not prohibited by Conn. Gen.

The court therefore held that the tenants were not prejudiced by the allowance of the amendment. The tenants also claimed that the trial court erred in denying their motion for a jury trial and asserted that they had a constitutional right to a trial by jury in a summary process action. The court held that the trial court properly denied the request for a jury trial pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-215.

The documents provided evidence that the employee was given information within the time necessary for him to meet the statutory requirements. The fact that the act distinguished between teachers purchasing in State versus out-of-state retirements credits did not violate the employee's equal protection rights because the State had a legitimate interest in conferring greater benefits on those who had previously served the State.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the trial court's jury instruction was constitutionally impermissible because it relieved the state's burden of proving the commission of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that the instruction's reference to the reasonable man standard did not relieve the state of its burden. Defendant was focused on merely one portion of the instruction, which had to be considered as a whole. When considered as a whole, it was clear that the trial court informed the jury that it was not sufficient that the jury find that, as a reasonable person, the defendant ought to have known that the aluminum was probably stolen or that he ought to have ascertained whether it was stolen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After failing to reach a collective bargaining agreement, the parties submitted the matter to arbitration. The arbitration report included a recommendation that the town adopt the union's proposal for an agency shop fee, which required the town to summarily discharge nonunion employees who failed to pay an agency shop fee to the union in amount equal to union dues. The town refused to enforce the agency shop provision, and the union filed a grievance. A subsequent arbitration award directed the town to comply with the agency shop provision, and the town filed the instant action. On appeal, the court held that the arbitrators did not exceed their authority within the meaning of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-418(d). The court reasoned that the arbitration submission was unrestricted and that the award conformed to the submission. The court further found that the town was attempting to enlarge the scope of the court's limited review by basically seeking a second determination of the dispute on the merits after being unsuccessful in arbitration and in the trial court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant board of education moved to strike count one for injunctive relief and count two for damages under either the Connecticut or United States constitutions in an action arising from plaintiff's expulsion from school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff student sued for injunctive relief and damages arising from defendant school board's decision to expel him, which was later reversed on constitutional grounds. Defendant moved to strike counts one and two. The claim for injunctive relief was moot since plaintiff returned to school and graduated. The claim for damages arising under the state constitution was dismissed because no common-law right of action for damages existed pre-1818 for the temporary deprivation of a public school education. Regarding the federal constitutional claim, the alternative remedy was inadequate, there was no explicit direction from Congress that a damages remedy should not lie, and no factors counseled hesitation. While the earlier injunctive relief returned plaintiff to school, it provided no remedy for injuries such as humiliation and embarrassment, damage to reputation, loss of consortium with peers, loss of participation in extracurricular activities, and recompense for legal expenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The motion was granted in part because the claim for injunctive relief was moot and no damages remedy was available under the state constitution, but denied in part because plaintiff could bring an action for damages under the federal constitution when the alternate remedy was inadequate and neither Congress or special factors foreclosed it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff town applied for an order in the Superior Court of Connecticut, Judicial District of Stamford; plaintiff sought to conduct inspection and environmental testing on defendants' land in contemplation of condemnation for municipal purposes. Defendants sought determination of, among other issues, whether Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 48-13 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff town applied for an order to conduct inspection and environmental testing on defendants' land, in contemplation of condemnation for municipal purposes. Parties sought determination of legal issues surrounding application. The court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 48-13, allowing entry onto proposed condemned land to conduct an inspection, was constitutional because it was not a taking. The court also held that notice under &sect; 48-13 was not the formal notice required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-129, because neither legislative history nor statutory language indicated a legislative intent to interpret the statutes together. Thus, failure to comply with &sect; 8-129 did not render application defective. Further, notice was only required to property owners or affected owners, not to lienholders. Accordingly, the court granted application, but limited testing to physical inspection, and required further judicial permission for collection of land and soil samples.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Application to conduct inspection granted, because statute permitting entry onto land for inspection purposes was constitutional, because no formal notice requirement was needed, and because lienholders did not have to be notified. However, further sampling of soil and water were subject to judicial approval and a showing of necessity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court held that because petitioner failed to show that defendant was the father of her child and charged with support and maintenance, petitioner's support petition was denied. Because neither petitioner nor defendant appeared, the State moved for default and sought an order for child support. The basis of the State's position was an acknowledgement of paternity signed by defendant pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-172. However, it was not a certified copy. The court found that because under &sect; 46b-172 the acknowledgement was required to be filed with the Department of Health, it was a public record. As such, in order for evidence of public records to be admissible, a properly certified reproduction of the public record needed to be produced. Although the State sought default, evidence still needed to be presented in order to enter a default judgment on a support petition. Because a certified copy of the acknowledgement had not been filed, there was no prima facie evidence to order support on default.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court denied the petition for support because petitioner on default failed to submit a certified copy of the acknowledgement of paternity signed by defendant and thus there was no prima facie evidence to order support and maintenance.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff instituted this declaratory judgment action to determine its rights under its insurance policy with defendant homeowners. Plaintiff later withdrew its action. Defendants and intervenors (hereafter, collectively, defendants) filed motions to restore plaintiff to the declaratory judgment action, fearing the loss of discovery that might not otherwise be ordered in the underlying injury action. The court denied the various motions, holding that plaintiff's right to withdraw was absolute. The court found that, even if the withdrawal statute permitted the court discretion to restore plaintiff to the action, it was unwilling to exercise it because there was no showing that the discovery material ordered to be released would not be discoverable in a subsequent action. There was also no showing of how defendants would be prejudiced.</SPAN></P>

Defendant zoning board reversed the ZEO's decision to issue plaintiff a certificate of occupancy for the home under Westbrook, Conn., Zoning Regulation 12.00.03, finding that the building permit should never have been issued because the site plan did not meet relevant regulations. The court held that a zoning permit operated as a certification in writing for purposes of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-3(f). Absent a finding that plaintiff's house failed to comply with the original zoning permit, defendant zoning board had no reasonable basis for overruling the ZEO's decision to issue a certificate of occupancy. Municipal estoppel prevented defendant zoning board from requiring plaintiff to bring the house into compliance with existing zoning regulations rather than the original zoning permit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff brought an administrative appeal under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-43 of defendant's decision relating to certain unimproved wetlands arguing that defendant's decision resulted in an unconstitutional taking of its property without compensation and also sought a declaration invalidating the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act and Waterway Protection Line Ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-43, plaintiff brought an administrative appeal of defendant's decision denying authority to conduct regulated activities on its property arguing that defendant's decision resulted in an unconstitutional property taking without compensation in violation of its due process rights. Plaintiff alleged that defendant improperly delegated its decision-making decision to its staff. Plaintiff also sought a declaratory judgment to invalidate the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-36a et seq., and Waterway Protection Line Ordinance, Westport, Conn., Code &sect; 148-1 et seq. The court affirmed defendant's decision. Plaintiff failed to prove that defendant illegally delegated its authority to its staff. Defendant's administrative record was sufficient to supports its ultimate conclusion because its findings indicated that without its limitations plaintiff's proposed activity would encroach on protected wetlands. The court refused to invalidate the challenged ordinances because they were rationally related to protect public health and safety.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In affirming defendant's administrative decision, the court held that plaintiff failed to prove that defendant unjustly delegated authority to its staff and that defendant's administrative record properly supported its decision protecting adjacent wetlands. The disputed ordinance and act were not invalidated because they were rationally related to public interest protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After being diagnosed with advanced Hodgkins Disease in 1997, plaintiff brought medical malpractice claim against defendants that alleged misdiagnosis of tissue samples during the 1980s. Defendants moved for summary judgment, asserting that action had long since been barred by applicable statute of limitations, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-584. Alternatively, plaintiff contended that continuing course of conduct tolling doctrine applied and that three-year limitations period was unconstitutional as applied. Court granted defendants' separate motions for summary judgment, holding that &sect; 52-584 barred plaintiff's action because more than three years had elapsed since occurrence of alleged misdiagnosis. Continuing course of conduct doctrine was inapplicable because there was only a single medical service provided and there was no breach of any duty that thereafter remained. Section 52-584 applied regardless of whether plaintiff had not, or in the exercise of care, could not reasonably have discovered nature of the injuries within three-year time period.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner sought to use the writ as a vehicle to expunge certain disciplinary reports from his prison records.

State trial court agreed and ordered petition dismissed, noting that habeas is a remedy available only if the party seeking relief avers that he is illegally confined or has otherwise been deprived of his liberty. Since petitioner neither claimed a liberty interest in the collateral effects of the disciplinary reports (loss of prison employment, ineligibility for recreational or educational programs, ineligibility for early release, etc.) nor that his confinement was unconstitutionally cruel and unusual, he had not stated a claim for which habeas relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>

Although defendant originally approved plaintiffs' application, plaintiffs thereafter agreed to withdraw that application and submit a new, virtually identical one when the owners of adjacent condominiums threatened to appeal on the grounds of lack of proper notice. Defendant thereafter denied the application in part on the grounds that the contemplated construction would constitute an invasion of privacy to the owners of adjacent condominiums. The court rejected plaintiffs' arguments that defendant could not reverse its previous decision, holding that a material change of external circumstances affecting the merits of plaintiffs' application occurred.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff filed a complaint against defendant city and asserted that defendant created a nuisance when it defectively extended a storm water drainage system beyond its original design. Defendant moved for summary judgment, claiming that there was no basis for a nuisance claim as a matter of law, and that plaintiff's claim was barred by the statute of limitations, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-584. On review, the court looked at the elements of plaintiff's claim and noted that, in addition to the traditional elements of a nuisance claim, plaintiff had to prove that the condition constituting the nuisance was created by the positive act of defendant. The court could not determine whether defendant's actions or inactions constituted a &quot;positive act&quot; in the case. Therefore, the court could not rule in favor of defendant. Defendant also asserted that the three-year tort statute of limitations applied, and submitted that the action was founded upon a tort. The court noted that the complaint could be viewed in various ways. Therefore, further information was needed in order to properly classify the action. Thus, the motion for summary judgment was denied as to both issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court denied defendant's summary judgment motion insofar as it claimed that, as a matter of law, a nuisance claim had not been set forth in plaintiff's complaint. As to the statute of limitations claim, the court held that there was not an appropriate factual record to decide the issue, where the complaint could be viewed under various theories as to the nature of the claim.</SPAN></P>

The court held that as sentence had already been pronounced, it was highly doubtful that a protest after the fact would have reversed the outcome. However, the court held that because petitioner had not intentionally rendered himself unable to pay the fines, pursuant to Conn. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant entered a guilty plea to capital felony murder under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-54b(a)(9), murder of a person under 16 years of age. A hearing was held in accordance with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-46(a)(b)(2). The jury, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-46a(f), determined that the aggravating factor found proven beyond a reasonable doubt outweighed the mitigating factors found proven by a fair preponderance of the evidence and thereby mandated the trial court to impose a death sentence. Defendant filed a motion to continue his sentencing so he could develop and present evidence that the death penalty was administered in an arbitrary manner by the state. The court denied the motion finding that defendant had ample notice and opportunity to be prepared to present the evidence requested in a timely fashion. The court held that for defendant to raise an equal protection claim on the basis of racial discrimination, he had to prove the decision-maker in his case acted with a discriminatory purpose. The court found defendant's motion did not allege purposeful discrimination in his particular case but instead attacked the entire legality of the state's capital sentencing scheme.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff fire district sought to enjoin defendant Connecticut labor board (SBLR) from conducting binding interest arbitration pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-473c pending disposition of a petition for decertification of defendant union. In response, the court granted defendant SBLR's motion to dismiss on grounds of sovereign immunity. The court explained that the doctrine could be asserted when a plaintiff sought to control the activities of a state. Here, the court explained, defendant SBLR would be barred from conducting collective bargaining if plaintiff succeeded; thus, an action against the state was involved. The court then rejected plaintiff's assertion that the imposition of binding arbitration would be illegal because defendant union no longer had the support of its members. In construing &sect; 7-473c(b), delineating powers of defendant SBLR, the court observed that the provision mandated binding arbitration when the parties could not negotiate an agreement. In the absence of any statute limiting arbitration when decertification petition was pending, the obligation to conduct binding arbitration was mandatory and within defendant SBLR's authority, the court concluded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant municipality argued that its ordinance banning the sale of cigarettes by vending machine was valid, because Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-289a(h) expressly provided that municipalities were not precluded from imposing more restrictive conditions of the use of cigarette vending machines than mandated by state law. The court disagreed, saying that the ordinance was preempted by state law, which limited vending machines to locations accessible only by adults. Because plaintiff cigarette vendor was licensed by the state, defendant exceeded its powers in attempting to remove a right authorized by the state, the court explained. The clear language of &sect; 12-289a(h) indicated that machines would continue to be &quot;used,&quot; and the outright prohibition of the machines -- as opposed to added restrictions -- was not legislatively intended, the court reasoned. As a direct conflict existed between the statute and ordinance, both having the common objective of reducing access by minors to tobacco, the ordinance must yield, the court ruled. Nor could defendant use its police powers to protect the public welfare when the resulting ban conflicted with the state statute, the court added.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Declaratory judgment granted that defendant's municipal ordinance barring a state-licensed vendor from distributing cigarettes by vending machine was invalid, because ordinance exceeded state statutory authorization allowing more restrictive municipal conditions on &quot;use&quot; of vending machines, and because ordinance preempted by conflicting state law under which plaintiff was licensed to sell cigarettes by vending machine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court rendered an articulation of the Order vacating an Order of Temporary Custody (OTC) and immediately restoring the child to the custody of respondents, his parents. The court stated that where, as here, an OTC was given on a social worker's written affidavit, fundamental fairness demanded that the order be dissolved upon displaying to the court subsequently obtained written documentation of changed circumstances. The court stated that when respondents demonstrated through a rent receipt that they could now provide housing for the child, the order was dissolved. The court found petitioner's suggestion that the housing was only assured for one month and the parents had no established means to support themselves displayed a total disregard of the requirement that the risk of physical danger to a child must have been immediate and that his immediate removal would be necessary to ensure his safety. The court stated that the predicted benefit to the child from being precipitately removed from immediate physical danger was not outweighed by the predictable emotional harm, resulting from such removal, and on that basis the court refused to continue the OTC.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff operated a business at a busy intersection. Defendant zoning officer advised plaintiff that defendant town's zoning regulations prohibited the display of &quot;open&quot; and all other commercial flags within the town. Plaintiff contended that the regulation violated her constitutional right to freedom of speech. The parties conceded that the &quot;open&quot; flag that plaintiff wished to display concerned lawful activity and was not misleading, and that public safety on the highway was a significant and legitimate governmental interest. The court found that the regulation directly advanced defendant town's interest in public safety by prohibiting those displays that cause the greatest distraction, e.g., flags, banners, etc., because these devices caused the greatest distraction to motorists because they moved and were not easily read. The court concluded that the regulation was not more extensive than necessary because while barring the most distracting advertising devices, it did permit plaintiff to use stationary signs for advertising. Therefore, the court held that plaintiff failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that regulations violated plaintiff's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff was the first lienholder on a motor vehicle that was towed to defendant.

Stat. &sect; 14-150, negligence, conversion, and violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-110a. Defendant moved to strike the complaint. The court granted defendant's motion to strike the negligence per se violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-150 because plaintiff was not within the class of persons the statute was intended to protect. However, defendant's motion to strike the remaining counts was denied because defendant was negligent in not notifying plaintiff when it sold the vehicle, and as a result plaintiff suffered damages. Moreover, defendant had no right to sell the motor vehicle without giving plaintiff actual notice of the sale. Therefore, plaintiff had sufficiently alleged a cause of action for conversion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff commercial partnership filed suit against defendant local planning and zoning commission, which amended the zoning regulations to limit the size of retail businesses in all business zones. Reviewing defendant's actions to determine whether the zone change was in accord with a comprehensive plan and was reasonably related to the normal police power under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-2, the court upheld the amendments. Where the zoning regulations objectives included the prevention of overcrowding, and the encouragement of orderly development of a shopping area, the court found ample evidence in the record illustrating that large retail stores could lead to increased traffic, congestion and parking issues, and that the amendments were consistent with the comprehensive plan. The court, in dismissing plaintiff's appeal, also found that because the amendments were reasonably related to control traffic and congestion and, as such, were within the enumerated police powers of &sect; 8-2, the amendments were valid.</SPAN></P>

The court held that plaintiff's workers' compensation claim was a cause of action, and so subject to the provisions of &sect; 17b-94, creating a lien in favor of the state. The court also held that plaintiff's compensation benefits were not exempt from a lien by the state because &sect; 17b-94 provided that proceeds from such a cause of action were assignable to the state for payment of the amount due under &sect; 17b-93, irrespective of any other provision of law.

Pointing to &sect; 8-3, the court said that appellee did not need to explicitly state its reasons, because its reasons -- that increased traffic could be controlled by limiting the size of businesses -- could be culled from throughout the record. Such reasons, the court added, were reasonably related to the general welfare of the community. While appellee had no comprehensive plan as such, the court noted that the &quot;plan,&quot; found in the zoning regulations, allowed for the regulation of traffic circulation, a topic consistent with the amendments.

Their zoning request was denied by the Planning and Zoning Commission (Commission), and the plaintiffs appealed, alleging that the denial was illegal, arbitrary, and an abuse-of-discretion. The plaintiffs further alleged that the Commission failed to approve an application that complied with regulations, misread and misinterpreted regulations, and ignored the fact that a previous house did not have direct frontage and that the regulations no longer required direct frontage. The court disagreed, noting that the town planner recommended against the proposed plan because of the lack of direct frontage. It was also noted that the previous houses did have direct frontage but used the right-of-way solely for joint access for topographical reasons. The court found that the proposal would not have met the regulations as they previously existed as plaintiffs claimed, nor was the previous right-of-way a non-conforming use.</SPAN></P>

The court found that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that Conn. Gen.

The court further found that the school attire policy was rationally related to the legitimate educational interest in reducing distractions, creating a safe environment, reducing clothing costs, promoting a sense of community among students, preparing students for the work environment, and enhancing the public perception of the school system, noting that plaintiffs had not argued that the rights allegedly violated were fundamental rights.

The court held that the legislative intent behind &sect; 16-262f was that utility receiverships have priority over the property owner's mortgage payments.

Thus, the court, after reviewing the record, found substantial evidence to support the amendment of the regulations. It also held that the amendments were reasonably related to police powers. Pedestrian access to businesses by constructing sidewalks was within the police powers enumerated in the enabling statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-2.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff commercial enterprise filed suit seeking to block certain zoning changes made by defendant municipal agency. Plaintiff objected to the proposed changes on the ground that they violated the comprehensive plan. The trial court rejected the plaintiff's objections and held for defendant, reasoning as follows: (a) modifications dealt with the municipality's comprehensive plan, which is a general plan to control and direct the use and development of property in a municipality by dividing it into districts according to present and potential uses of the property; (b) in order for a zoning change to be upheld, it must be in conformance with the comprehensive plan and reasonably related to normal police powers enumerated in state law; (c) the evidence supported zoning changes, as they dealt with traffic patterns, a legitimate concern; (d) regulations were sufficiently particular as to give notice of their objective; and (e) notice provisions were adequate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Judgment was granted to defendant municipal agency; zoning changes in question were motivated by traffic patterns, a permissible concern, and were valid since they were in conformity with the comprehensive plan.</SPAN></P>

Defendant DOL filed a motion to dismiss contending that the doctrine of sovereign immunity deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction. The court stated that the doctrine of sovereign immunity implicated subject matter jurisdiction and, therefore, was a basis for granting a motion to dismiss. The court also stated that a state is immune from a suit unless it consented to be sued. The state may consent to be sued in certain cases by appropriate legislation waiving its sovereign immunity. In addition, sovereign immunity did not bar suits against state officials acting in excess of their statutory authority or pursuant to an unconstitutional statute. The plaintiff employee's action against defendant DOL did not demonstrate that sovereign immunity had been waived. Furthermore, the complaint did not contain any allegation that defendant DOL had acted in excess of its authority or acted pursuant to an unconstitutional statute. Therefore, the court granted defendant DOL's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant planning and zoning commission amended the zoning regulations in three of its business districts, limiting the permitted size of retail businesses therein. Plaintiff, a limited liability company that owned certain developed and undeveloped property in one of those districts, appealed from defendant's decision, asserting that defendant did not establish an effective date for the amendments, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-3(d), the content and adequacy of the notice provisions were fundamentally unfair, defendant's members prejudged the issues, and the zoning change effectively precluded any further development of plaintiff's property. The court disagreed, finding that defendant did set an effective date and did not violate the concepts of fundamental fairness. There was no evidence that the minds of defendant's members were so intractable as to demonstrate either unfairness or a pre-determined outcome. Finally, since plaintiffs were not denied any use of their land, there was no unconstitutional taking.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff's appeal dismissed; zoning regulation amendments which significantly limited the further development and use of plaintiff's property in designated business district were not reversed because defendant zoning commission properly notified public, invited public comment, provided opportunity to be heard, and did not deny plaintiffs of every use of their land.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant planning and zoning commission voted to amend its zoning regulations pertaining to its business districts. In the central district, the permitted use was reduced from a gross floor area of 20,000 square feet to a maximum gross floor area of 10,000 square feet. Plaintiff, who owned property in the central district, argued that defendant acted illegally. Plaintiff first claimed that defendant did not state the reasons for the approval of its amended regulations on the record. The court stated that defendant did not have to state its reasons on the record, and that it was the duty of the reviewing court to search the record for evidence supporting the decision of defendant. The court found that the decision was supported by substantial evidence, as the record showed that traffic was a topic of concern. Further, the court found that there was ample evidence demonstrating that the amendments were consistent with the comprehensive plan, which was in this case found in the zoning regulations themselves. Finally, the court held that plaintiff failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that the regulations as applied were vague or unascertainable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff appealed a decision from defendant Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles suspending his motor vehicle operator's license pursuant to Conn.

Stat. &sect; 14-227b(f) when he found that plaintiff's blood alcohol content exceeded 0.10 percent because plaintiff rebutted the presumption by presenting expert evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff sought review of a decision from defendant commissioner of the department of motor vehicles suspending his motor vehicle operator's license pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b. Plaintiff claimed that he rebutted the presumption of intoxication found in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b(f) as a matter of law by presenting expert evidence that alcohol trapped under his dental plate could have affected his breath test results. Plaintiff further argued that the presumption was unconstitutional as applied to him because it was mandatory. The appeal was dismissed. The court held that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the hearing officer's decision. Plaintiff's expert testimony did not rebut the statutory presumption of intoxication where it showed only the possibility that plaintiff's blood alcohol content was less than 0.10 percent. To rebut the statutory presumption the evidence had to do more than raise a mere theoretical possibility that the presumed fact did not exist. Also, the presumption was constitutional. According to the court, a hearing officer could rely on the presumption if he or she disbelieved the expert evidence presented to rebut it.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 8-9 and 8-8(b), plaintiff property owner challenged a decision of defendant municipal zoning commission that adopted revisions to a municipality's zoning regulations and map, which affected plaintiff's property. Plaintiff raised issues in support of its claim that defendant acted illegally, arbitrarily, or in abuse of its discretion, and also contended the decision was an unconstitutional taking.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff property owner, a corporation, challenged a rezoning decision of defendant municipal zoning commission changing zoning classifications for an area that encompassed portions of its property, claiming the procedure followed at a public hearing violated its due process rights because defendant failed to give its reasoning for the revisions and the sole comment specific to plaintiff's property was made by a member during closed deliberations, thereby depriving plaintiff of the opportunity to cross-examine or rebut the comment. Plaintiff, represented by its attorney, was an active participant in the public hearing. Plaintiff also argued defendant violated state statutes regulating zoning decisions by failing to provide notice by mail to plaintiff about the proposed revisions, and that defendant's actions constituted a regulatory taking for which the plaintiff was entitled to just compensation. The court affirmed defendant's decision because defendant did disclose the basis for its revisions, the statutory provision authorizing defendant to provide notice by mail was not mandatory, and individual reasons advanced by its members were not grounds for defendant's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court upheld the zoning change after determining defendant's decision to adopt the zone change was reasonably supported by the record, and declined to rule on plaintiff's inverse condemnation claim because further evidentiary proceedings were necessary for the equitable disposition of the claim.</SPAN></P>

The town health director denied the request and defendant, the state department of public health, affirmed. Plaintiff appealed arguing that the town health director's order was an improper exercise of his authority, that she did not convert the building on her property, and that the regulation was unconstitutionally vague and uncertain. The court dismissed plaintiff's appeal. The court held that plaintiff failed to raise her first argument regarding the improper exercise of authority during the administrative proceedings and thus waived this claim. The court held that the standards set forth in the regulation were sufficient to withstand plaintiff's void for vagueness challenge.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff land owner was issued a notice of violation by the local health director when she began making renovations on a summer home.

Plaintiff's appeal of the notice of violation was dismissed as untimely. The trial court denied the health director's subsequent petition for injunctive relief, but the appellate court reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Following defendant university's decision to demolish a building allegedly located within a district listed on the National Register of Historic Places, 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 471a, plaintiffs organized to seek injunctive relief to prevent the demolition under the authority of Connecticut Environmental Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-16 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Pursuant to the Connecticut Environmental Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-16 et seq., plaintiff preservationists sought permanent injunctive relief in order to prevent defendant university from demolishing a certain building, alleging that the building was located in a district listed on the National Register of Historic Places, 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 471a. The court held that, considering all the evidence presented, the demolition of the building would not be unreasonable. Defendant rebutted the prima facie case put forth by the plaintiffs but also proved that renovation was not a prudent alternative to demolition. Any effort to restore the building would be a replica not a restoration of the building's original design. Defendant's cost to restore the building would be substantially more than the fair market value of the property after renovation was complete. Therefore, defendant had demonstrated, as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-17, that the proposed demolition was consistent with the reasonable requirements of the public health, safety, and welfare.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court denied the plaintiffs' petition for permanent injunctive relief and entered judgment in favor of defendant university. Defendant demonstrated renovation of a purportedly historic building was not a prudent alternative to demolition. Any effort to restore the building would only create a replica of the building's original design. Therefore, proposed demolition was consistent with the requirements of public health, safety, and welfare.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that there was a narrow category of civil cases in which a state must provide access to its judicial processes without regard to a party's ability to pay. The court stated that proceedings to terminate parental rights was one example because such a proceeding was irretrievably destructive of the most fundamental family relationship. However, the court held a change of custody did not fall within the narrow category because it did not sever the parent-child bond. The court therefore denied plaintiff's motions for transcripts free of charge. The court held that in order for plaintiff to be entitled to an appeal she was required to satisfy the court that the appeal was nonfrivolous. The court concluded that plaintiff was not entitled to an appeal of the modification of custody because the issues which she intended to raise were frivolous. The court, therefore, denied the motion to waive the fee for appeal.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-115(1) during defendant's lease of plaintiff's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The lease between the parties required defendant, as lessee, to comply with all federal and state laws during the term of the lease. Defendant argued that the six-year statute of limitations barred plaintiff owner's claim for the creation of pollution on plaintiff's property. The court held that any continuing obligation on defendant created by environmental laws ran to the government and not to plaintiff. The duty to remediate only became operative to the extent government authorities concluded remediation was possible or necessary. Whenever the continuing duty doctrine was applied to extend the limitations period, the duty must be found to have run to the party claiming the injury. Therefore plaintiff was not insulated from defendant's statute of limitations defense. There was no claim of a special relationship between the parties or that after the term of the lease defendant engaged in wrongful conduct related to wrongful acts committed during the term of the lease. However, any continuing statutory obligation defendant might have had as a result of pollution it caused during the lease ran only to the state or federal government.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant's motion for summary judgment was granted because the statute of limitations barred recovery for pollution caused by defendant where defendant had no continuing duty to plaintiff which would extend the limitations period.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the Commission acted properly, within its rights and powers, and that defendant had no compelling claim to procedural protections deriving from any entitlement purportedly bestowed by his original place on the incorrectly scored list.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed a judgment from the Board of Tax Review (Connecticut) denying its request to revalue its property for the grand list for the years 1993-1997. Defendant city moved for summary judgment on grounds that its property valuations conformed to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-62h.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff taxpayer filed suit against defendant city seeking revaluation of its property. Plaintiff claimed that defendant failed to implement decennial revaluation for the grand property tax list of October 1, 1990. Plaintiff alleged that defendant improperly continued to value plaintiff's property at the October 1, 1980 fair market valuation and that resulting grand lists for October 1, 1993-1997 were grossly excessive, disproportionate, and unlawful valuations. Defendant moved for summary judgment, arguing that it properly stayed the valuations pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-62h. The court found that section 12-62h allowed municipalities to suspend implementation of a decennial revaluation for up two years pending property tax reform in 1995. The court noted that defendant had attached minutes of Board of Alderman meetings to prove it had acted properly under section 12-62h. While section 12-62h was retroactive, defendant's acts were insufficient to prove that it properly postponed decennial revaluation all the way back to 1990. Because there was a genuine issue as to whether defendant's acts between 1990-1994 were proper, its motion for summary judgment was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged in a multiple count information, which included a count charging defendant with sexual assault in the fourth degree in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-73a(a)(1)(A), and a count charging defendant with violating the Connecticut Risk of Injury Statute. Defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal as to these two counts. The court denied defendant's motion. There was sufficient evidence for the jury to have found defendant guilty of these two counts. The court rejected defendant's claim that the sexual assault statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts of this case because he could not have known that his innocent touching of the victim's breasts for the purpose of treating her medical conditions could be construed as sexual assault. There was sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that defendant was not providing medical attention. The court rejected defendant's claims that the section of the Risk of Injury Statute was repealed by implication as the result of amendments to that statute. The section of the statute under which defendant was charged was virtually identical to the former Risk of Injury Statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court denied defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal, holding there was sufficient evidence for jury to have found defendant guilty, that the sexual assault statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied, and that the section of the Risk of Injury Statute was not repealed by amendments to that statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner's habeas corpus petition seeking relief from his sentence to a term of fifteen years execution, suspended after ten years, was denied. In denying petitioner's habeas petition, the court held that petitioner failed to meet his burden of establishing that he had ineffective assistance of counsel and that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-125a was unconstitutional. According to the court, to succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim a petitioner must show that there was reasonable probability that but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different. The court held that petitioner failed to prove this issue. The court then held that the amendment of &sect; 54-125a was not unconstitutional. The court found that although &sect; 54-125a added a limitation to the Board of Parole's authority it did not give an inmate any right to demand or even apply for parole, nor did it require the Board to actually consider any inmate's eligibility for parole even if he had fulfilled the statute's requirements. Thus, the court held that petitioner did not have an absolute right to be paroled.</SPAN></P>

Defendant began condemnation proceedings for easement rights on plaintiffs' property, which was adjacent to the landfill. Plaintiffs moved for declaratory and injunctive relief. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment. Both the special act and the taking were constitutional because they served a legitimate governmental purpose. Defendant's compliance with the consent order allowed defendant to contain the level of water contamination caused by defendant's landfill. In turn, the special act allowed defendant to comply with the consent order by giving defendant the rights it needed to condemn property outside its borders. Similarly, the taking was a necessary means to achieve the abatement of contamination, and thus the taking was for a public use.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff argued that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46-83(a) was unconstitutionally vague and dismissal of the complaint was erroneous.</SPAN></P>

The court held Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46-83, the statutory provision under which plaintiff's complaint was dismissed because the claim purportedly had no real possibility of succeeding, was not void for vagueness either facially or as applied to plaintiff. The court held Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46-83 used terms of common usage having a plain and ordinary meaning, the &quot;no real possibility&quot; standard was explained to the plaintiff, and the dismissal standard recognized in other legal settings. The court held that the evidence reasonably provided a basis for defendant to believe that no discrimination against plaintiff had taken place. Plaintiff provided no evidence that employer disciplined plaintiff for failing to speak English in certain work settings. Plaintiff appeared to be bilingual and fluent in English. The employer's requirement to speak English was directed at those who spoke Portuguese.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff claimed that the suspension violated his rights to due process and constituted double jeopardy because he was not given notice of the Connecticut consequences of his refusal to allow Massachusetts authorities to test his blood alcohol, and he was punished twice for the same offense. The court affirmed defendant commissioner's decision because plaintiff had notice that his driving privileges could be suspended by refusing the test, and an administrative suspension of a criminal defendant's driver's license did not constitute multiple punishment for the same offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff, an animal rights group, alleged that the state department of environmental protection (DEP), supervised controlled hunts during which fawn deer were killed in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 22a-16 and 26-86f. Plaintiff filed suit against defendant, DEP's commissioner, requesting declaratory and injunctive relief. Defendant moved to compel plaintiff to provide proper notice, in accordance with Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff owned stock in defendant corporation and served as one of the two directors. Defendant director owned the remainder of the stock and served as its president. Plaintiff filed a complaint seeking judicial dissolution of corporation. Plaintiff filed an amended complaint seeking dissolution based solely on deadlock of directors in the management of the corporation. Plaintiff's motion to strike defendant's notices of election to purchase in lieu of dissolution was denied. Defendants' motion to stay judicial proceedings pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 33-900(d) and to determine the fair value of the shares was granted. Plaintiff provided the same set of facts under both complaints. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 33-900(a) did not clearly state under what section a purchase in lieu of dissolution could be maintained. The amendment between when plaintiff filed the original complaint and the amended complaint attempted to clarify the existing statute. By adopting the technical changes, the legislature made it apparent that the omission of a reference to shareholder or director deadlock was inadvertent. The amendment had a retroactive effect on the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner entered a guilty plea at a time when the law allowed the parole board to consider parole for a prisoner convicted of petitioner's crimes after the prisoner served 50 percent of his sentence. The law in place at the time petitioner was sentenced required a prisoner to serve 85 percent of his sentence before he was eligible for parole. Petitioner filed a habeas corpus petition claiming that the increase in the required time to be served constituted a retroactively applied increased punishment. After construing the allegations in petitioner's complaint in their most favorable light, the court found that petitioner alleged facts that supported a claim for violation of the ex post facto clause of the U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. Therefore, the court determined that the violation gave the court subject matter jurisdiction and concluded that the action was properly before the court.

Plaintiff also contended that the DCF's final decision violated his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection. The court found that hearing officer's final decision was consistent with the evidence presented at the hearing and based upon substantial evidence, which supported the conclusion that the DCF treatment plan denying visitation was in the children's best interests.

XIV, as well as Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Defendants filed a motion to strike plaintiff's complaint. With regard to plaintiff's taking without just compensation claim, the court found that claim was not ripe under the Williamson doctrine because plaintiff failed to exhaust its available state remedies. Further, the court found that plaintiff's claim did not rise to a violation of substantive due process, especially in light of the availability of post-deprivation remedies.

The court held: (1) there was no Connecticut precedent suggesting that legislative appointments of commissions which serve executive functions violated the separation of powers provisions, federal law relied on by the candidates was distinguishable on the basis of the appointments clause, and state law rejected a rigid application of the separation of powers doctrine, so the candidates failed to demonstrate the unconstitutional composition of the commission; (2) the disclosure was proper under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Conn.

Plaintiff association was the exclusive bargaining representative for all of the town's uniformed police personnel. Plaintiff members alleged they were the subjects of formal internal investigations based on internal complaints of employees within the police department. Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment to determine whether the police manual was unconstitutionally void for vagueness, as applied to them, and whether the police regulations deprived them of numerous constitutional rights. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint. The court denied defendants' motion to dismiss, finding that plaintiffs properly sought declaratory judgment regarding the constitutionality of the police manual that was a basis of defendants' actions against plaintiffs. Based upon Conn. Gen.

The court affirmed defendant's ruling, holding that the zoning permit authorized plaintiffs to place storage trailers on the premises to temporarily store materials and tools incident to the construction and repair of the business at that location. Plaintiffs' trailer, however, contained personal items stored incident to plaintiffs' move into an adjacent residence. Clearly, such use was not in keeping with the usage authorized by the zoning permit. Because the record contained substantial evidence that the actual usage of the trailer varied from that permitted by the zoning permit, the court upheld defendant's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found that defendant zoning board's decision upholding the cease and desist order was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or illegal. Instead, the court found that defendant's decision was supported by substantial evidence in the record, because plaintiff property owners were no longer using the subject trailer for the purposes authorized in their special permit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff property owner appealed the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals of the Town of Mansfield (Connecticut), which denied his application for a finding of zoning agent error in plaintiff's action to enforce a town ordinance regarding lighting.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff property owner complained to defendant town about a neighbor's lighting system. No enforcement action was taken because the lighting was found to be a private nuisance. Plaintiff appealed to defendant zoning board, which denied the application, based upon absence of jurisdiction. On appeal, the court held that plaintiff satisfied the jurisdictional prerequisites of aggrievement, timeliness, and service of process. The court determined that defendant zoning board had jurisdiction over plaintiff's appeal because the action was an appeal from an enforcement action. The court remanded because defendant zoning board's denial was based upon its erroneous belief that it did not have jurisdiction, and thus, the court could not properly entertain the appeal. Plaintiff's constitutional challenge of the zoning regulation failed because he could not seek relief from a regulation and in the same proceeding challenge its constitutionality. Further, the delegation to defendant zoning board of the right to determine whether a complaint constituted a private nuisance was valid because it was not unconstitutionally vague where it contained intelligible standards upon which to act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court remanded because defendant zoning board did not deny plaintiff property owner's application for a finding of zoning agent error based upon the merits of the claim, but rather on the erroneous assumption that it lacked jurisdiction. The court also held that plaintiff could not challenge the subject zoning regulation as he was seeking to enforce the regulation and further, the regulation was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff creditor filed an action against defendant debtor seeking to foreclose a judgment lien.

Defendant also asserted counterclaims, alleging violations of CUPTA and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The plaintiff filed a motion to strike defendant's special defenses and counterclaims. The court granted the motion to strike the special defenses of homestead exemption and CUPTA and the counterclaims. The court held that the homestead exemption was inapplicable because the action arose from a contract entered into in 1991. The court held that CUTPA was not available as a special defense and that the counterclaim asserted under CUPTA was without merit. Because defendant's counterclaim alleging negligent infliction of emotional distress contained no allegation of actual injury or causation, it failed to state a claim upon which relief could have been granted.

However, the statute imposed mandatory notice, procedure, and hearing requirements, including documents and an application with specific verbiage as set out in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-278c. Because the state failed to comply with the specific requirements of the statute, it was not entitled to the prejudgment attachment that it sought.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The contractors contended that they would have submitted bids if they were not required to enter into the PLA. The court granted the motion to dismiss, finding that the taxpayer had no standing to challenge the bidding process because he did not provide any information on how his pecuniary interests would be harmed. The court held that the subcontractors did not have standing because a diminished possibility of potential work as a subcontractor on a particular project was too attenuated an interest to give them a legal stake in the bidding process. The court found that the association had standing to bring the action on behalf of its members, but had not shown the existence of favoritism, fraud, or corruption in the bidding process. Thus, the association did not have standing to challenge the bidding process. The court determined whether using the PLA was actually an effective method of achieving the state's aims in completing a major public works project within the necessary time and financial constraints was not for the court to decide. Thus, the commissioner's decision to use the PLA was a legitimate exercise of his discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant state filed a motion to dismiss an action filed by plaintiff an unsuccessful candidate for a job with the department of public safety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The unsuccessful candidate brought an action against the state alleging that the department of public safety denied him a job because he disclosed that he was homosexual in a pre-employment polygraph test. He further alleged that the test administrator's report included remarks that did not fully and accurately reflect statements he made before and during the polygraph. The unsuccessful candidate argued that the amendment of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-142, which listed the claims excepted from the claims commissioner's jurisdiction, waived the application of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The state filed a motion to dismiss and argued that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-142(2) did not waive sovereign immunity. The court ruled that nothing in the language, legislative history, or common law background of 1996 Conn. Acts 85, which amended Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-142, suggested that it was intended to diminish sovereign immunity or enlarge the state's waiver of the doctrine and thereby expand the jurisdiction of the court. Therefore, the court did not have jurisdiction over the unsuccessful candidate's claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff property owners filed an application with defendant Redding, Connecticut, Planning Commission (commission) seeking approval of a subdivision. The commission approved the application, subject to six specific conditions, in addition to standard modifications and conditions of approval. The property owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The property owners argued that the conditions imposed by the commission constituted an abuse of discretion. Specifically, the property owners challenged the requirements that: (1) stop signs be provided at an intersection, (2) area be added to a right of way, (3) the side of a road be redesigned, and (4) the design of a turnaround be acceptable to the planning consultants. The parties agreed that the commission had no jurisdiction over the maintenance of roads or placement of stop signs. Thus, the appeal was sustained related to the stop sign requirement. It was also agreed that the commission could require that the right of way be widened. The court held that the commission could not require a developer to improve an existing abutting highway where no intersecting streets were being created. Although the commission could have required the deeding of property to the town as a condition of subdivision approval, no authority existed for the demand that an applicant design or reconfigure an existing public highway. The property owners' obligation under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-25 was met once land sufficient for road widening purposes was deeded to the town.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">It was agreed that the condition requiring stop signs was improper and that the commission could require the deeding of property for the right of way. The unchallenged conditions for approval remained. The conditions appealed from were modified as follows: (1) area was ordered to be added to a road right-of-way, and (2) the extension of a road and the turnaround was ordered to be deeded to the town.</SPAN></P>

Regarding the third special defense to count three, the dispatcher alleged that it was immune from liability pursuant to the common law doctrine of municipal immunity. The court agreed with plaintiff, however, that the common law doctrine of municipal immunity had been wholly supplanted by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-557n. Therefore, the third special defense to count three was stricken. Regarding allegations that the dispatcher's actions were wilful and wanton, the court determined that such allegations also involved factual issues which were not properly resolved on a motion to strike.

IV and XIV, and violations under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983 and 1988. The parents also filed claims against defendants, a police officer and employees of a child care center.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The three state employees worked for the Connecticut Department of Children and Families (DFC). The parents alleged that when the employees of the child care center reported that the parents abused their minor children, the state employees, acting within their scope of employment, trespassed upon the parents' property which caused the parents extreme emotional distress. They also alleged that the state employees' acts violated their rights guaranteed under U.S. Const. amend. IV and XIV and under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983 and 1988. The court granted the state employees' motion to dismiss the parents' claim of trespass against them and held that the parents' allegations under their trespass claim regarding malice were conclusory. However, the court denied the motion as to the parents' claims of a violation of their rights under U.S. Const. amend.

The Board brought an action against the town itself claiming the amendments were illegal and invalid in that they exceeded the town's powers under the Home Rule Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. ch. 99. The reviewing court held that the amendment permitting the town mayor to be a member of the board would result in the attempt by one person to faithfully and impartially discharge the duties of both.

The court noted that if an adequate administrative remedy existed, it must be exhausted before the superior court would obtain jurisdiction to act in the matter. The exhaustion doctrine reflected the legislative intent that such issues be handled in the first instance by local administrative officials in order to provide aggrieved persons with full and adequate administrative relief. In this case, the court found that plaintiffs were merely attempting to relitigate their dispute with the town's decision by now claiming constitutional violations.

The superior court noted that the only submission to the arbitrator were for breach of contract and CUTPA violations; thus, the effect of the case claimed by the committee was not part of the submission, and not subject to the decision of the arbitrator. Additionally, the evidence demonstrated that the DEP had not taken any serious action against the processor for its alleged violations of the environmental statutes, although it unquestionably had the power to do so and was well aware of the processor's conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner Connecticut Department of Children and Families (DCF) filed petitions for the termination of the parental rights of respondent biological mother to her three children. DCF also sought an adjudication of the rights of respondent fathers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Two of mother's children were placed in foster care after an older sibling died from an unexplained brain injury while he was in the mother's care. The youngest child was born after her sibling's death and was immediately placed in foster care because the mother was incarcerated. DCF initiated neglect proceedings against the mother. The court terminated the mother's rights to the three children. After the commencement of the trial, the court allowed DCF to amend its neglect petition and to withdraw the termination petition in regard to the youngest child's father. This was proper pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super Ct. &sect; 35-1 which allowed a petition to be amended any time prior to a final adjudication. Petition amendments were liberally permitted and the amendment did not cause the surprise, unfairness, occasioned no delay, and did not increase the mother's trial burden. It was proved by clear and convincing evidence that the two older siblings fathers had abandoned their children because neither father had pursued visitation, or displayed affection, love, or concern for the children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court terminated the biological mother's parental rights to the three children. The youngest child was to remain committed with DCF for one year, and the other two children were to be placed for the purpose of securing an adoptive family.</SPAN></P>

The Board denied the first request for a variance and also denied plaintiff's second request, following plaintiff's changes to its plans. The court affirmed the denial of the first request and reversed the denial of the second request. The court found that the grounds espoused by the Board for its first denial were reasonably supported by the record and pertinent to the considerations under the local zoning regulations. The court determined that the Board's reasons for its second denial - namely that plaintiff could have considered other locations for the water tower in no way related to the relevant considerations. The court concluded that plaintiff showed that based on the property's low elevation, enforcement of the zoning regulations would result in unusual hardship and that construction of the new tower would benefit public health and welfare and therefore the variance should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The property owners had owned certain premises located in the Town of Lebanon.

When the property owners had refused to comply with this order, the zoning commission had filed a motion for an injunction to compel them from ceasing to occupy the premises at issue on a year round basis. The court issued a judgment that granted the zoning commission's motion for an injunction. The court did not find the zoning regulations at issue were unconstitutional. There was no equal protection violation because the property owners had not shown a pattern of discrimination for establishing an arbitrary discrimination. The zoning regulations had not unconstitutionally taken the property at issue because there was no practical confiscation. Finally, the town had proved its right to an injunction pursuant to Conn.

The court was required to affirm the agency's decision unless it found that substantial rights of the person appealing were prejudiced because the administrative findings were clearly erroneous in light of the substantial evidence. The court found that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the commission's findings and conclusions that the allegations of harassment were either time barred under Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff applicant filed an action against defendant planning commission, alleging the invalidity of the planning commission's vote to deny the applicant's site plan application and seeking a writ of mandamus. The planning commission and defendant homeowners file motions to strike the applicant's complaint, alleging that one of the two persons voting to deny the application was a valid member of the planning commission for voting purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The applicant filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that, assuming that the dissenter was a valid member of the planning commission, a three-member majority was necessary to deny its application, and mandamus should issue as a matter of right. The court read the allegations of the complaint in the light most favorable to the applicant. When the complaint was so read, it appeared that the dissenter was not an appointed officer at the time of the vote in question. The planning commission's assertion that he was a de facto officer could not be established without evidence. The applicant's first theory of the case survived a motion to strike. The court determined that the 2-1 vote to deny the application did not amount to a rejection of the application. Because the zoning enforcement officer lacked an interest in the outcome of the case and because his participation was unnecessary to grant the relief actually requested in the case, the planning commission's argument that he was a necessary or indispensable party was unpersuasive. In exercising its discretion whether to issue the writ, the court decided to hear evidence about the consequences of the proposed order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, the Commissioner of the State of Connecticut Department of Public Works, filed a motion to dismiss the complaint filed by plaintiff contractors that sought injunctive relief. The commissioner sought dismissal of the entire complaint on the ground of sovereign immunity and argued that an injunction would interfere with the performance of important government functions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The commissioner invited bids for a construction project that required each bidder to sign a project labor agreement (PLA). The contractors did not submit bids because of the requirement and filed a claim against the commissioner seeking injunctive relief and contending that he acted in excess of his authority under the bidding statutes set forth in Conn. Gen. Stat. 4b-91et seq., that certain parts of the bidding statutes were unconstitutionally vague and unlawfully delegated authority, and that the commissioner's actions constituted an unlawful infringement of the constitutional rights to free speech and association. The commissioner filed a motion to dismiss. The court denied the motion finding that the contractors' complaint contained sufficient allegations to overcome the bar of sovereign immunity. The commissioner's decision to require each bidder to sign a PLA supported an inference of favoritism toward union contractors and a conclusion that the commissioner's decision was contrary to the policy underlying the competitive bidding statutes. Further, whether the statute contained standards to promote fairness in the bidding process required a close scrutiny of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The builder claimed that he was entitled to an immediate release of the bonds because a Connecticut municipality was not authorized by state statute to exact performance bonds, except in relation to subdivision applications, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-25. All other functions of municipal government were subject to enabling legislation, and without a specific grant of the power to do so, a municipality was not entitled to elect to exact a performance bond for construction work within its borders. The court entered judgment in favor of the chairman. The town was using a modest performance bond to insure that private builders did not create problems, which the town later had to correct. Nothing in the case law or the statutes of Connecticut prohibited the imposition of a performance bond designed to achieve that end. The builder failed to show that he had any right to a release of his bonds until the town was satisfied that it need not draw on the bonds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff husband filed a motion seeking, a termination of his alimony obligation to the defendant wife as provided in a decree of dissolution of marriage, the repayment of certain alimony payments, and attorneys fees or costs. By contempt citation, the wife sought a finding that the husband was in contempt by reason of his failure to make certain payments of alimony as required by the decree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The husband sought a termination of his alimony obligation alleging that the wife had commenced &quot;cohabitating&quot; with another man. Soon after he filed the motion for termination, the husband ceased making alimony payments to the wife, which prompted her issuance of a contempt citation. Because the parties did not rely on Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-86(b), the court's analysis was limited to the operative effect of the decree of dissolution. The court observed the rule that a judgment, entered pursuant to a stipulation of the parties, which provided for the termination of alimony upon the recipient's cohabitation was entitled to enforcement in accordance with its terms. Proof of cohabitation alone was sufficient to terminate alimony where relief was sought pursuant to a clause in the underlying judgment that alimony was to terminate upon &quot;cohabitation&quot; without reference to any alteration of the cohabiting party's financial needs. Moreover, the court held that the cohabitation clause was self-executing and that it was not unconstitutional. Therefore, upon finding proof of the wife's cohabitation, the court granted the husband's motion and dismissed the contempt citation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court granted the husband's motion for termination of his alimony obligation and ordered the wife to reimburse payments received after she commenced cohabitating with another man. However, the court denied that part of the husband's motion that sought attorneys fees or interest. The court dismissed the wife's contempt citation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The licensee, a used car dealer, was charged with violating Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-61, 62(c), 12(g). A DMV hearing officer found that the charges were proven, imposed certain penalties, and suspended the licensee's authority to issue new registrations and temporary transfers until the licensee's representatives were retrained. On appeal, the court held that the licensee violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-61 by failing to submit to the DMV the temporary registration papers within seven days of issuance. Further, the hearing officer properly concluded that the licensee unlawfully issued temporary registrations without first obtaining safety inspections, as required by &sect; 14-61 and Conn. Gen. Stat. 14-12(g). Moreover, the DMV's exhibit established that a certain vehicle was transferred to a purchaser before the licensee obtained the vehicle's certificate of title, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-62(c). The licensee could have called the purchaser as a witness to support his claim to the contrary. Finally, the hearing officer's findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence as required by the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-166 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the decision that found the licensee violated temporary transfer requirements, certificate of title requirements, and out of state inspection requirements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The state appealed the decision of a magistrate in Family Court in the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain (Connecticut) denying the state's petition on behalf of plaintiff mother to enforce a Michigan child support order against defendant father, who was a Connecticut resident. The state initiated this action under the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act, 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1738B.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff mother filed a paternity action against defendant father in Michigan, where she and the child resided. Defendant's counsel sought to have the case dismissed for lack of in personam jurisdiction. The Michigan court denied defendant's motion and found that it had jurisdiction. The state of Connecticut, on behalf of the mother, sought to enforce the Michigan support order under the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act (FFCCSOA), 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1738B. The family court denied the petition and refused to enforce the Michigan support orders. On appeal, the court held that, under Michigan law, where defendant appeared specially in the Michigan action to object to the court's jurisdiction, he was precluded after an adverse ruling from collaterally attacking the court's judgment. The court found that the FFCCSOA was constitutional under both the Commerce Clause and the Tenth Amendment and held that, to the extent it conflicted with Connecticut laws on the reciprocity of child support orders, the Act preempted such laws. The court reversed the decision of the magistrate and remanded the case to the family court for a determination as to the amount of the arrearage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the decision of the family court magistrate and held that the Michigan child support orders were entitled to full faith and credit in Connecticut. Because the parties had not submitted financial information to the court, the case was remanded for a determination of the amount of the arrearage and the amount defendant should have been required to pay based on his financial status.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff mortgage assignors filed a foreclosure action against defendants, mortgagor and tax sale purchaser. In a second, consolidated case, plaintiff mortgage assignee sought declaratory relief and damages against defendants, town, tax collector, and tax sale purchaser. The assignee and the purchaser filed separate motions for summary judgment in the second case; the purchaser also filed a motion for summary judgment in the first case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The cases were consolidated because they involved the same parcel of mortgaged real estate. In December 1993 the assignors assigned the mortgage to the assignee. In January 1994 the assignors filed their foreclosure action. In June 1994, the tax collector sold the property at issue to the purchaser at a tax sale. The court followed an appellate case that had rejected a due process challenge to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-157, similar to that raised by the assignee. To successfully challenge the sale, the assignee had to show (1) lack of prior notice of the sale to it or its predecessors under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-157, and (2) that it did not learn of the sale within one year after it was made. Though the assignee lacked prior notice of the tax sale, the assignees had such notice, albeit after they had already assigned the mortgage. Further, the assignee's vice president learned of the tax sale shortly after it took place. That the vice president did not understand the legal consequences of the sale was immaterial for purposes of &sect; 12-157. As the prima facie evidence of the purchaser's unencumbered title could not be overcome, it was entitled to summary judgment in both cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The assignee's motion for summary judgment in the second case was denied. The purchaser's motions for summary judgment in both cases were granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The landowners purchased land, which the landowners wanted to develop into a residential community. The Connecticut Hazardous Waste Management Service announced that part of the property was one of three candidate sites for the construction of a disposal facility for low-level radioactive nuclear waste. The landowners were unable to continue with the residential development and obtain funds from sales to pay down debt. The funding for the site was never appropriated and the landowners filed suit against the Service and alleged that the designation of part of the property as one of the three finalists for acquisition as a low-level radioactive waste disposal facility was a taking of the landowners' property. The court found that there was no taking and held that because no land was physically taken and no interest in the land was extinguished or affected, the prohibition against taking of property without just compensation in Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The injured party was employed as an assistant clerk in the bail commission office. The injured party claimed she suffered from two traumatic brain injuries, which caused high distractibility and a decrease in her short term memory. She asserted defendants were aware of her condition and wantonly, willfully, and maliciously undertook a continual course of harassment that was both extreme and outrageous. Consequently, she suffered severe emotional distress. She did not file any affidavits in response to the supervisor's motion to dismiss. Thus, the evidence submitted in support of the supervisor's motion to dismiss was unrefuted and required dismissal of the claim. As the injured party alleged the co-worker's actions were wanton, willful, malicious, extreme, and outrageous, sovereign immunity did not bar her claims.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On remand from the state supreme court, the trial court considered defendant's challenge to his execution by lethal injection after defendant contended it constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the Connecticut Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The state supreme court remanded defendant's case to allow him to challenge his execution by lethal injection as cruel and unusual punishment under the state constitution. At a hearing, the State called as a witness an anesthesiologist who attested to the lack of pain associated with the proper implementation of the written procedure, the procedural safeguards involved, and the minimal skill and training actually necessary to carry out the procedure. The defense called as witnesses persons who either participated in a task force to establish a procedure for carrying out death by lethal injection, or were anticipated participants in the procedure. Additionally, the defense offered a transcript of the testimony of a doctor from a prior hearing on the same issue. That doctor attested to the risks attendant to a procedure for implementing an execution by lethal injection, the potential for pain associated with those risks, and the failure of an administrative directive to address those risks. After the hearing, the trial court found defendant had not met his burden of showing the procedure violated the state constitution, and thus concluded his challenge should be denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant's constitutional challenge to the State's method of execution was denied.</SPAN></P>

The domestic corporation brought the instant action, seeking to clarify its rights under the licensing agreement. The foreign corporation asserted that the court did not have personal jurisdiction. The court granted the foreign corporation's motion to dismiss, holding that while the foreign corporation had constitutionally sufficient minimum contacts with Connecticut, the assertion of personal jurisdiction over the foreign corporation would not have comported with the constitutional principles of due process. The court said that asserting personal jurisdiction over the foreign corporation would not have comported with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice because virtually all of the critical factors necessary for the adjudication of the action were connected to Ohio.</SPAN></P>

The zoning board argued that the citizens failed to exhaust their administrative remedies by appealing the granting of the special permit directly to the court. The court ruled that if an adequate administrative remedy existed, it must be exhausted before the court obtained jurisdiction to act in the matter, and that exhaustion was required even in cases where the agency's jurisdiction over the proposed activity was challenged.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff husband filed a complaint in two counts. The first count sought a decree annulling the marriage and the second count sought a dissolution of the marriage.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The parties were married in a ceremony that took place at the husband's home in Connecticut. The home was totally within the boundaries of Connecticut. A priest of the Episcopal Church, who was known to the parties, performed the marriage ceremony. The priest was rector of a church in New York. Both parties claimed that there was a deficiency in obtaining the necessary ecclesiastical permission for the priest to perform the marriage ceremony in Connecticut. The court concluded that civil law, not canon law, determined the solemnization of the marriage ceremony under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-22. There was no statutory requirement that the clergyman performing the marriage ceremony had to be working in the ministry in Connecticut. Therefore, the priest was an authorized person to perform marriages in Connecticut. In addition, there was no evidence that the ceremony he performed was deficient according to the traditions of the Episcopal Church. The court concluded that the case was a request to examine the internal workings of Episcopal Church canon law, and the court would not apply canon law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant claimed that the jury array violated the jury summoning statutes, federal and state constitutional rights, and the right to heightened procedural protection including the right to reliable sentencing proceedings. The court stated that in Connecticut, the jury administrator prepared a master list from a larger pool of names called the source list annually for each judicial district. The voter list and motor vehicle list comprised the source list. The master list was generated from town voter's registries and the state motor vehicle list of licensed drivers, minus the duplicates. Defendant focused on three factors relating to the representation of Hispanics: (1) English ability requirement; (2) undeliverables; and (3) no-shows. The court found that defendant failed to state a prima facie case of violation of the U.S. Const. amend. VI, equal protection, or due process. In addition, defendant's arguments with regard to heightened protection, jury summoning statutes, and independent state constitutional protection were without merit.</SPAN></P>

The town ordered the property owner to cease and desist from installing the kitchen and bathroom. The order was the subject of a civil action, which ended with a stipulated judgment whereby it was agreed that the property owner was to apply for a special use and that he would be bound by the outcome of that application. The zoning commission denied the property owner's application. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the commission did not act arbitrarily in failing to grant the property owner's application for a special use, in that its decision in the matter was not predetermined. The court further held that the commission's denial did not amount to an unconstitutional confiscation of the owner's property. The owner was not losing any of the rental income that was available to the owner of that house at the time he acquired it. He was merely being limited, as a consequence of the commission's action, from increasing the revenue he hoped to receive.</SPAN></P>

The minor child and her mother's complaint alleged only negligence and neither an absence of custodial rights nor knowledge that the father of the minor child did not have custodial rights and the court determined that the mother failed to state a cognizable cause of action for interference with custodial rights. The court further determined that both the minor child and her mother asserted that they were deprived of their right to equal protection of the law but they did not explain any way in which they suffered a deprivation distinct from the claimed seizure. Finally, the court denied the motion to strike as to the minor child and her mother's indemnification claim against the town.

Stat. &sect; 4-166 et seq., seeking review of a decision of defendant, the State of Connecticut Psychiatric Security Review Board (PSRB), which ordered that the individual remain confined at a hospital for care, custody, and treatment under maximum security conditions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The individual was charged with murder. He was found not guilty by reason of a mental disease or defect and was committed to the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health. The PSRB held a hearing to review the individual's status and ordered that he remain confined at a hospital for care, custody, and treatment under maximum security conditions. The individual sought review of the portion of the PSRB's order requiring that he be confined under maximum security conditions. The court dismissed the appeal, concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to review the PSRB's decision. The court noted that under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-597, it had jurisdiction to review PSRB decisions as to conditional release or confinement under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-584 and temporary leave decisions under Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The subdivision developer filed an application with the commission for approval of a subdivision plan of a tract of land. The representatives of the subdivision developer and the commission reached a tentative agreement regarding the plan, subject to submission of the agreement to the commission as a whole for its approval. Thereafter, the commission unilaterally modified the agreement. The subdivision developer appealed the commission's decision. The court sustained the appeal and remanded the matter to the commission. The court held that commission's approval of the plan as modified was not proper because the modifications constituted a major revision of the plan as submitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), as receiver for a bank, appealed the decision of defendant, Commissioner of Revenue Services of the State of Connecticut, seeking a refund of taxes and interest paid pursuant to the Connecticut Corporation Business Tax (CCBT), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-213 through 12-242.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The CCBT required corporate taxpayers to include interest income received from federal, state, and local bonds as part of their gross income. Based on the CCBT, the Commissioner assessed a deficiency against the bank, and the bank paid the taxes and interest due thereunder. As receiver for the bank, the FDIC sought a refund of the taxes paid, but the Commissioner denied the refund. In its appeal, the FDIC contended that the CCBT discriminated against the FDIC as a holder of federal obligations and that the Commissioner failed to issue timely notice of the deficiency assessment under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-233. The court dismissed the FDIC's appeal. The FDIC failed to raise its discrimination claim at the audit and thereby deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction. The court then held that the Commissioner's notice of deficiency to the bank fell within the applicable three-year statute of limitation as evidenced by computer records and supporting testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff filed new complaints in an attempt to distinguish the action from one that would fall under a decision on a previous motion to strike, which was stayed. The basis for plaintiff's claim was that the trial court did not address substantive due process claims. The court found that the prior decision was applicable to the second amended revised complaint. The essential action was unaltered: it claimed an unconstitutional &quot;taking&quot; of property without just compensation. The stay was terminated as to the original decision, and the decision was applied to the Second Amended Revised Complaint. Defendants alleged that plaintiff had not been deprived of its property without due process because the property was taken after a judicial condemnation action. Also, they claimed that due process was met by plaintiff's pending lawsuits, one for replevin and the other an appeal of the taking. The court held that the fact that defendants went through a process did not mean that the value was &quot;just compensation.&quot; The plaintiff stated a claim for deprivation of just compensation. However, plaintiff had not yet exhausted its remedies, and defendants were entitled to have the complaint stricken.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted by a jury of stalking in the first degree, stalking in the second degree, two counts of harassment in the second degree, disorderly conduct, and criminal violation of a protective order. Defendant was sentenced to seven years, three months, suspended after four years. The sentence on the disorderly conduct was three months. After serving several months of incarceration defendant was release on an appellate bond. On appeal, defendant's conviction for disorderly conduct was reversed. Defendant's convictions were affirmed in all other respects. Defendant filed a motion for resentencing, which was opposed by the State who sought to have the original sentence imposed less the three months for the vacated disorderly conduct count. The court conducted a post-sentencing hearing and defendant showed that he had married and was successfully employed. The court held that pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-39(a), it did not have authority to reduce defendant's sentence because the original sentence was longer that three years.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In a sexual assault in the first degree and risk of injury case, defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained in a search of his home on the ground that the magistrate issuing the search warrant relied upon an affidavit that contained stale information and to suppress the evidence found at his neighbor's home on the ground that the warrantless seizures there violated his constitutionally protected expectation of privacy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Based on an affidavit indicating that minors complained of defendant's sexual involvement with them, a search warrant was issued for pornographic video tapes and sexually explicit materials. Numerous items were seized from defendant's home. The police received information that defendant was seen removing items from his neighbor's home. After the neighbor consented to a search of her home and yard, the police seized garbage bags, a box, and briefcases and searched those containers. Defendant sought to suppress the evidence seized from his home on the ground of staleness, as the warrant authorized a search for videos which were &quot;easily transferable,&quot; but was based on activity which took place weeks earlier. The court held that the issuing judge could reasonably have determined there was probable cause to believe that defendant was engaged in on-going pedophilia and that associated materials would be found at his home. Defendant did not have standing to challenge the search of the garbage bag, the briefcases, and the open box of videos obtained from the neighbor's home, as defendant abandoned any reasonable expectation of privacy in them by telling the neighbor to say they were hers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court denied the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
