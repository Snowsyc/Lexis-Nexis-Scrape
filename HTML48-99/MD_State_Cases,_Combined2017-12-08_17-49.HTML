</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county had adopted a portion of their charter which held that the county government could not contract for phone services at a rate higher then charged to other subscribers. The phone company brought an action for a declaratory judgment holding that portion of the charter unconstitutional and a preliminary injunction ensued. The taxpayers appealed the granting of the interlocutory injunction. The taxpayers claimed that the balance of convenience favored not granting the injunction. On appeal, the court affirmed the injunction holding that trial court had properly considered both sides and had properly found the balance of convenience to favor the granting of the injunction. The court held further that the trial court had been correct in finding that the phone company had no adequate remedy at law and therefore would have suffered irreparable harm had the injunction not issued.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland), which convicted him of unlawfully wearing and transporting a handgun, for which he was sentenced to ten years in prison. He alleged that the trial court erred when it sentenced him as a second offender, though the state failed to comply with Maryland Rule 734, and that the admission of records that were not provided to him during discovery was error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and convicted of unlawfully wearing and transporting a handgun after police recovered five handguns from the floor of the van from which he had fled. The court found no error in the admission of the records from the Motor Vehicle Administration and the Department of Assessments and Taxation showing essentially what defendant had willingly conceded, that defendant was a principal in the corporation that owned the van. The court affirmed the conviction and the sentence, holding that the state's failure to specify under Md. R. 734 the prior conviction relied upon for enhanced sentencing did not preclude enhanced punishment. Here the state's notice provided adequate and timely notice that told defendant all that he needed to know in order to decide intelligently how to plead to and defend against the current charge. The state's intention to treat defendant as a subsequent offender was clearly imparted to him, and he had actual knowledge that the conviction alluded to was the one emanating from the Criminal Court of Baltimore in 1979; thus, the function and purpose of the rule had been satisfied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction and the sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee town's board of county commissioners passed an ordinance that rezoned appellant property owner's land. On an appeal by the town and intervenor department of state planning, the Circuit Court for Frederick County (Maryland) reversed the action of the commissioners, thereby denying the reclassification. The property owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the property owner filed an application for rezoning of its land to permit the land to be used for a truck stop, the commissioners passed the order rezoning the land to permit such a use. The trial court found that the record did not contain sufficient evidence of mistake or change in the neighborhood to justify the rezoning. On appeal, the property owner questioned whether the trial court erred in determining the date from which change was to be measured, in finding that there was insufficient evidence of change to support the reclassification, and in finding that the reclassification was not a proper exercise of legislative discretion based on the county's comprehensive plan. The appellate court held (1) that the trial court properly determined that the date from which change was to be measured was the date of the county's last comprehensive rezoning ordinance, and (2) that the trial court correctly found that there was not such a change in the character of the neighborhood that the rezoning was required because the only change of consequence was a change to the text of the county's most recent comprehensive rezoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order that denied the reclassification of the property owner's land.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police officer sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland), entered in favor of appellees, police chief and others, in an action challenging disciplinary action taken against the police officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police department regulation provided that no member of the department could publicly criticize the official action of any member of the department. In the instant case, the police officer, in a hostile manner, publicly criticized fellow police officers in the performance of their official duties and charged them with harassing a business owner who he alleged took care of the police. A department hearing board recommended disciplinary action including extra duty without pay. The police chief approved the board's recommendation. The trial court affirmed the actions of the police chief. On appeal, the police officer argued that the department regulation at issue was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court found that the board determined that the police officer's comments were demeaning and injurious to the reputation and morale of fellow officers. That finding was entitled to considerable deference. The court also found that the department's legitimate interest in discipline, esprit de corps, and efficiency outweighed the police officer's desire to speak out on the matters in question. The regulation did not restrict any constitutionally protected conduct or speech.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of the police chief and others in an action brought by the police officer challenging disciplinary action taken against him and held that the challenged regulations were constitutionally sufficient to withstand charges of overbreadth and vagueness.</SPAN></P>

The claimant's injuries occurred in Maryland. The insurer refused to pay the difference in benefits. The trial court awarded benefits to the claimant. The court held that the trial erred to the extent that its order excused the insurer from paying the difference between the benefits payable under the Maryland award and the amount payable for the same disability under the District of Columbia law, including the full amounts prospectively authorized by the 1972 amendments of 33 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 906 and 910, which allowed an increase in benefits payable for permanent total disability or death in the applicable national weekly wage over that of the previous year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had entered into an agreement with two police officers that he would give a truthful statement with respect to the robbery in exchange for not being charged with the crime. The evidence of defendant's involvement with the crime belied the statement, and the decision was made to prosecute. On appeal, the court remanded for the limited purpose of determining the validity of the agreement. The court held that the agreement was not an offer of immunity. Nor was the agreement a plea bargain because defendant did not enter a guilty plea. However, the agreement was a recognizable bargain entered into by defendant and authorized by the state attorney. Because there was a pending criminal charge against defendant, due process required judicial intervention to review the terms of the bargain and the respective performances according to those terms. Such determinations by the trial court were required to ensure that defendant was not deprived of a successful plea in bar to his trial for robbery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendants were charged with violating the Act, they filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the basis that phenylcyclohexyl-pyrollidine (PCPy) was not a controlled dangerous substance in the state and that Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 278(c) was unconstitutional. The trial court granted a judgment in favor of defendants. Upon review, the court reversed. The court found that PCPy was a &quot;new&quot; substance within the meaning of &sect; 278(c) because the Maryland Department of Health and Hygiene adopted the federal law that listed PCPy as a controlled substance. The court noted it was not necessary for the department to conduct a hearing under &sect; 278(c) unless it objected to the inclusion of the new substance. The court held &sect; 278(c) was not unconstitutional on the grounds that it impermissible delegated legislative authority to the department where Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 278(a) adequately guided and restrained discretion on the part of subordinate officials and it was the state agency and not the federal one that made the final determination. The court concluded regulatory promulgations published in the Federal were sufficient to place defendants on notice of prescribed activity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both defendants were convicted of daytime housebreaking and appealed. On appeal, defendants claimed that they were both denied their speedy trial rights and the trial court erred in the manner in which it reinstructed the jury in response to a jury question raised after the jury began to deliberate. The court disagreed and held that Md. R. 746 mandated that a trial take place within 180 days, but made no provision for severance; the only ground for severance was stated in Md. R. 745(c). The court ruled that reading both rules together, the trial court was authorized to allow the delay, as the addition of other defendants made finding a suitable trial date more difficult. The court found that the trial court did not err in reinstructing the jury on the jury's question on a point of law and not including a reinstruction for the defense on the prosecution's burden of proof and the presumption of innocence. The court concluded that defendants did not comply with Md. R. 757 when they failed to object to the reinstruction to give the trial judge an opportunity to correct the plain error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While investigating possible fraudulent activity on the part of appellees, nursing home and hospital, appellant, Attorney General of Maryland (State) seized certain records from a building that was owned by appellee property owner and leased to the hospital. The Criminal Court of Baltimore (Maryland) ordered the State to return the seized records and refused to allow the State to examine the records prior to returning them. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of the lower court's order, there were no criminal charges pending against any of the parties. The State contended that the records were seized pursuant to a lawful search warrant. The court held that (1) Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 551 (1982 Repl. Vol.), which dealt only with searches executed under a warrant, and the federal exclusionary rule were totally divergent remedies and served completely different purposes; (2) the lower court lacked jurisdiction to entertain motions prior to the pendency of criminal charges pursuant to Md. R. Crim. Causes 4-736; (3) the property owner lacked standing to seek the suppression of evidence; (4) none of the parties were entitled to suppression of evidence at the grand jury level; (5) the issuance of an ex parte injunction was improper because there was no evidence to support it; and (6) there was sufficient evidence of probable cause to issue the search warrant, including an affidavit that established that certain hospital employees were attempting to obstruct justice by removing files relevant to the ongoing investigation. Thus, the court held that the evidence was insufficient to warrant the return of the records under &sect; 551.</SPAN></P>

The jury was unable to agree whether a death sentence should be imposed, so defendant was sentenced to life in prison. The case had been removed from another county's circuit court. The prosecution had filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant claimed that the jury was improperly selected and that the case had been improperly removed.

Defendant also argued that the prosecution had been improperly allowed to impeach and bolster the credibility of its witnesses and that the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain the conviction. The court held that: (1) excluding prospective jurors who announced that they had conscientious scruples against capital punishment was consistent with case law and not improper; (2) Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 20 did not entitle defendant to be tried in the county where the offense occurred; (3) the trial court did not err regarding evidentiary and procedural issues raised by defendant; and (4) the evidence was legally sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

After conducting public hearings, the Council amended the sectional zoning map to delete the rezoning recommendation and adopted the map in its amended form. The trial court held that the process was part of a comprehensive rezoning that bore a substantial relationship to the public welfare and was entitled to a presumption of validity, that the construction companies failed to overcome that presumption, and that the Council did not act in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner. On appeal, the construction companies argued that the Council deviated from the master plan without evidential justification, and hence the Council's action was not a comprehensive rezoning entitled to a presumption of validity.

Ann. Code art. 89, &sect; 32.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citation was issued to the corporation as the result of two incidents of heat stroke and a subsequent investigation by the Maryland Occupational Safety and Health Administration (MOSHA). MOSHA alleged that the corporation failed to furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which were safe and healthful as well as free from recognized hazards that were causing or were likely to cause death or serious physical harm to the employees. On the union's appeal, the court stated that the scope of review was restricted to whether a reasonable mind could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached. A reviewing court could not substitute its judgment for the expertise of the administrative agency. In the case at bar, the trial court concluded that the finding of the Commissioner of Labor and Industry was not supported by substantial evidence. The court agreed. The evidence showed that the corporation furnished cool-off rooms, water fountains, salt tablets, and issued forceful and regular reminders of the hazards of heat exposure. These precautions were well within the limits of those adopted by other companies in the industry.</SPAN></P>

The court held that 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 4653 did not provide immunity for the taxation as the tax was not imposed on the United States.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Criminal Court of Baltimore (Maryland), which sentenced him to four consecutive terms on convictions for attempted first-degree rape, burglary, common law assault, and openly carrying a dangerous and deadly weapon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of four crimes, and was sentenced to four consecutive terms. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and vacated in part. The court affirmed the convictions and sentences for attempted first-degree rape, burglary, and carrying a deadly weapon. The testimony of the state's witnesses was not contradictory. Probable cause existed for the warrantless search of defendant because an officer observed defendant on the block where the crimes occurred within minutes of receiving a radio alert, defendant matched the description provided to the officer, and the name that defendant gave the officer was the same name that the victim provided to the police. The court affirmed the 20-year sentence for burglary and the life sentence for attempted first-degree rape. The court found that the 20-year sentence for common law assault was constitutional, but vacated it because the state had charged defendant with assault with intent to rape, which had a 15-year maximum sentence. This acted as a cap on the common law assault. The court merged the common law assault conviction into the attempted rape because they arose from a single act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions and sentences for attempted first-degree rape, burglary, and carrying a deadly weapon. The court vacated the sentence for common law assault and merged the conviction into the conviction for attempted first-degree rape. The court ordered costs to be paid by defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Criminal Court of Baltimore City (Maryland), which was entered upon a jury verdict finding him guilty of rape in the first degree, robbery with a deadly weapon, kidnapping, and attempted sexual offense in the first degree. Sentences were imposed, and defendant filed a motion for new trial which was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial judge erred in refusing to dismiss the indictments because defendant was not tried within 180 days of the first appearance of his attorney as mandated by former Md. R. 746. The court found that defendant was brought to trial on the 180th day after the appearance of counsel. Defendant also argued that the trial judge erred when he refused to grant the motion for a new trial on the ground that defendant had been denied his right to trial by an impartial jury. The court found that defendant waived his rights under former Md. R. 754(a). The court further found that defendant failed to establish that the &quot;young adult&quot; group was cognizable under law and that he failed to establish a prima facie case of systematic exclusion of young adults. Lastly, defendant urged that the trial judge committed reversible error when he permitted the State to call a witness even though his name had not been disclosed in the discovery process. The court held that the record disclosed that the witness did not come as a total surprise to defendant or his counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Criminal Court of Baltimore (Maryland), denying his motion to dismiss five indictments for bribery, Md. Code Ann. art 27, &sect; 23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found to have engaged in unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of the Consumer Protection Act (Act), Md. Code Ann., Com. Law I &sect; 13-301 et seq. The state subsequently brought criminal proceedings against defendant for bribery under Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 23, alleging that defendant had bribed city plumbing inspectors by giving the inspectors money to process plumbing permits although the jobs had not actually been inspected. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, maintaining that the criminal action was barred by the constitutional protection against double jeopardy and the doctrine of res judicata. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion. Bribery was not an unfair trade practice within the Act. Additionally, the Act was concerned with all consumers and its scope was removed from that of the bribery statute, which was directed at public employees and officeholders. Finally, the elements and standards of proof required to show bribery or unfair trade practices were demonstrably different. Thus, the offenses were not the same.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying defendant's motion to dismiss the charges of bribery was affirmed because the state's prior civil action under the state's consumer protection act did not bar criminal action for bribery.</SPAN></P>

The comptroller appealed from that summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the circuit court. The court ruled that the comptroller could not, by certain regulations in connection with the distribution, sale, and marketing of petroleum products in the state, achieve the result reached by Md.

The trial court ruled that clause three of the new ordinance was an unconstitutional exercise of the police power. The trial court also held that clause three was severable, leaving the ordinance intact and valid. The court held that the ordinance was a valid exercise of legislative power by the municipal government, that the offending clause three was severable, that summary judgment was proper, and that the owner's proposed expansion was subject to the regulatory powers of the Board. The protection of the town was a legitimate exercise of the police power that would benefit the public health, safety, and welfare. The ordinance was a reasonable way of regulating construction and the permit and license requirements for development was not unduly oppressive upon individuals.

The trial court denied a prayer by the city for injunctive relief, requesting that the county be precluded from submitting an annexation resolution to a referendum vote by the county electorate. On appeal by the mayor and the aldermen, the court stated that the issue was whether &sect; 19(u) substantially comported with Md. Const. art. XI-E when it legislated with regard to the organization, government, and affairs of municipal corporations in the county in a manner which impermissibly classified those corporations on a basis other than population. The court stated that Md. Const. art. XI-E, &sect; 1 prohibited the General Assembly from enacting legislation effective in a particular municipality unless it applied to all municipalities within a class. Article XI-E, &sect; 1 set forth the principle of uniformity for general laws. In the case at bar, Md. Ann. Code art. 23A, &sect; 19(u) applied to appellee county only.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because defendant had previously been convicted of &quot;crimes of violence&quot; on two prior separate occasions, the State sought imposition of a mandatory 25-year term of imprisonment pursuant to Md. Code art. 27, &sect; 643B(c). The trial court imposed the mandatory sentence, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. On appeal, defendant asserted that the mandatory sentence was partially based upon two robbery convictions obtained pursuant to a city statutory scheme that automatically tried 16- and 17-year olds as adults. That city statutory scheme had been held unconstitutional by a federal district court. The court affirmed the convictions and the mandatory sentence. The prior convictions were valid when entered, were not subject to expungement, did not subject defendant to legal disabilities, and could be used for impeachment purposes. There was no reason why they were to be regarded as less than valid and viable convictions for purposes of the mandatory sentence provisions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the private school students were not entitled to participate in such activities.

The court reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings and found that, even though the state had tendered payment, it had not placed legal restrictions on the property for a period of time that caused substantial interference with the property that destroyed or lessened its value, and possession in some form had not occurred.

Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 14(b)(1)(iii) was unconstitutional insofar as it denied appellant taxpayer the right to a five percent decrease in his county real property taxes because his property was not owner-occupied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was the owner of a single family dwelling situated within the county. The property was not occupied by the taxpayer. During the course of his endeavor to lighten his tax load the taxpayer sought the benefit of a homestead exemption available to a single-family or two-family owner-occupied residential dwelling under Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 14(b)(1)(iii). The supervisor and a tax court ruled that the taxpayer's property did not qualify for such treatment, as it was not owner-occupied. The trial court held that the statute was unconstitutional. The court held that the uniformity requirement of Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 15 pertained to taxation within a sub-classification, and the court was directed to no such violation in the taxpayer's case. The new sub-classification was defined as being a single-family or two-family owner-occupied residential dwelling. As homestead property it was provided a special allowance. The allowance applied to all property qualifying for the sub-classification. Thus, it satisfied the uniform tax treatment mandated by art. 15. The record was devoid of any indication that the stated basis for the special allowance was not reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his robbery conviction, arguing that the court erred in denying his motion to suppress. Defendant argued that certain physical evidence should have been suppressed because his arrest was executed without a warrant and without exigent circumstances and that his confession should have been suppressed because he had been deprived him of his right to assistance of counsel and privilege against self-incrimination. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court rejected defendant's contention that his arrest was illegal. The court found that there were ample exigent circumstances justifying the warrantless entry into defendant's home, noting that there was strong probable cause that defendant had committed a violent crime, that he was armed, and that he was likely to escape if not swiftly apprehended. The court found that defendant's pre-Miranda confession had been properly admitted into evidence, noting that the booking officer's revelation that defendant's wife had informed police of defendant's whereabouts was not the functional equivalent of an interrogation within the meaning of the Miranda decision.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendant's motion. The jury found defendant guilty of felony murder and armed robbery, and the court entered judgment in accordance with the jury's findings. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and held that the search warrant was not an illegal general warrant because the police specifically identified defendant's apartment building within the apartment complex. The court also held that it was not error for the trial court, during voir dire, to deny defendant's challenges for cause regarding prospective jurors who were victims of robbery because they indicated that their victimization would not prevent them from rendering a fair and impartial verdict in defendant's case. Additionally, although the court found that it was error for the trial court to allow the prosecution to make comments about facts not in evidence during closing argument, the court held that this error did not prejudice defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried before a jury and convicted of false imprisonment, robbery with a deadly weapon, carrying a handgun, and using a handgun in the commission of a felony. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial judge erred in refusing to instruct the jury that it must find that defendant's confession was voluntary before considering it with the other evidence. On appeal, the court concluded that the lower court committed reversible error in its failure to instruct the jury as to the voluntariness of the confession. The court reasoned that whenever a confession was introduced into evidence and instructions as to its voluntariness were requested, the trial judge must administer the proffered instruction regardless of his personal belief in the absence of evidence necessary to support the contention of involuntariness. Thus, defendant's convictions were reversed and the case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

After being approached by the trooper, defendant stated that he was not the driver, and a speeding citation was issued to another occupant. A second police trooper then approached and stated that defendant was in fact the driver, and defendant was cited for speeding and driving with a revoked license. Defendant alleged on appeal that his prosecution was collaterally estopped because the occupant who was first fined paid the citation and settled the issue as to who was the driver. The court affirmed, holding that defendant waived the issue of collateral estoppel due to his failure to meet the time specifications under Md.

He claimed that the mandatory disclosure of the amount of his income violated his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Defendant was convicted in the trial court of three counts of failing to file his state income taxes. On appeal, the court affirmed his convictions. The court held that Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 280, which adopted the federal definition of &quot;income&quot; for the purpose of the state income tax, was constitutional and was not an unlawful delegation of legislative authority. The court ruled that the trial court properly instructed the jury on the privilege against self-incrimination and the fact that defendant's failure to file his taxes had to be willful to constitute an offense. The court determined that the trial court properly refused certain instructions proffered by defendant. The court held that defendant failed to preserve a valid objection to one of the trial court's instructions because he did not state the grounds for the objection as required by former Md. R. 757f.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a divorce action, the lower court granted an ex-wife exclusive use and possession of the family home for three years for herself and her minor child from a former marriage. The ex-husband sought review, claiming that this award imposed a duty on him to support his stepchild. On review, the court examined the legislative history of Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 3-6A-06 and found that the legislation was meant to encompass the needs of any minor child, including stepchildren, to continue to live in a familiar and stable environment following their parents' divorce. The court found that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in making the use and possession award. The court did conclude, however, that the lower court's award of alimony to the ex-wife was excessive, given the income and expenses of the ex-husband. The court remanded the case for further proceedings on the issue of alimony. The court found that there was no abuse of discretion in the amount of attorney fees awarded by the lower court to the ex-wife, given the financial circumstances of the parties and the ordinary factors of labor, skill, and time needed to prepare and present the case.</SPAN></P>

After hearings in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland), a judgment was awarded against appellant parents up to the maximum amounts allowed under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents contended that &sect; 3-829, which authorized imposition of the restitution judgment against them, was unconstitutional, because it imposed liability on them without regard to their fault. The court disagreed with the parents' contention. In a previous case, the court upheld the constitutionality of the strict liability features of &sect; 3-829. In &sect; 3-829, the legislative determination demonstrated a legitimate State interest in a matter affecting the general welfare. The remedy selected for the protection and promotion of that determination had not been shown to be arbitrary, oppressive, or unreasonable. The parents also argued that the judgment should be reversed, since the State did not establish at the restitution hearing the necessary prerequisite of willfulness or maliciousness. The issue of willfulness and maliciousness was not directly addressed by either the State or the parents at the restitution hearing. Under the &quot;Statement of Facts,&quot; the juvenile's &quot;wilful and malicious&quot; destruction of property was described therein. The parents' affixed their signatures to the statement, conceding that the juvenile's actions were wilfully and maliciously executed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner owned a three-story house built in the early 1900's in Baltimore City along with adjacent property. The landowner bought the house intending to tear it down and erect a parking structure. When the landowner applied to the Commissioner of Housing and Community Development (HCD) for a permit to demolish it, the HCD forwarded the application to CHAP. Thereafter, CHAP formally recommended the house for inclusion on the landmark list. HCD notified the landowner that the demolition permit was withheld pending city council action as to its inclusion in the landmark list. Thereafter, the city council approved inclusion of the house on the landmark list. During the hearing on the landowner's application for a demolition permit, the landowner argued that the house had no reasonable economic use. The court reversed the denial of the demolition permit and held that CHAP's denial of the permit was improperly based upon an incomplete study that renovation of the house was economically feasible. The court held that CHAP arbitrarily ignored the only unbiased substantial evidence in the record, the report produced by a former rehabilitation services administrator for the city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After police officers went into defendants' bookstores to buy adult magazines, defendants were charged and convicted of violating Md. Code. Ann art. 27, &sect; 418. In the decision finding defendants guilty of &sect; 418, the trial court never specifically determined that the magazines at issue were in fact obscene. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment finding defendants guilty of &sect; 418. The court remanded the case to the trial court for a new trial in order to determine whether the magazines at issue were obscene. The court ruled that the trial court not only improperly omitted to make an ultimate finding that the magazines were obscene but also erroneously indicated that obscenity was assumed. The court stated that the trial court therefore inappropriately assumed a critical element of guilt. For purposes of the retrial, the court ruled that defendants were not afforded protection to &sect; 418 by an exemption under Md. Code. Ann. art. 27, &sect; 423 solely because their bookstores contained a sign indicating that the magazines were being sold for scientific and educational purposes and rejected defendants' claim that &sect; 423 violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. art. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court finding defendants guilty of exhibiting obscene material with the intent to distribute and remanded the case for a retrial so that the trial court could address the issue of fact regarding whether the magazines were obscene.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Audits conducted by a private contractor for the department determined that the nursing home was not entitled to reimbursement after reviewing the lease agreement, tax returns, and partnership records. The corporation was entitled to reimbursement only for ownership costs the partnership incurred, including depreciation, amortization of interest during construction, mortgage interest, interest on demand notes, property taxes, insurance and accounting expenses, and repairs, rather than rental expenses. The court was persuaded that the corporation and partnership were properly deemed related organizations. The court pointed out that the regulations recognized that individuals may have perfectly legitimate business reasons for associating with an organization related by common ownership or control, and that it was not the motivation that was determinative, but its practical effect, as the regulations prevented &quot;double-dipping.&quot; The court held that the regulations were not applied arbitrarily or capriciously. As the state was acting in its government capacity in providing Medicaid services, the court held that equitable estoppel did not apply, and the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which sustained the decision of the department to deny reimbursement to the nursing home.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that the company's general burden included proving that the purchaser was not a bona fide purchaser for value. The court noted that the purchaser, even though he did not allege that he was a bona fide purchaser for value, did not need to offer any evidence except in response to evidence first offered by the company showing that he was not a bona fide purchaser for value. The court stated that the company's petition was insufficient to meet its burden.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee news commentator filed a defamation action against appellants, a radio show host and the station owner, alleging that a joke told by the host on the air was defamatory. The Baltimore City Court (Maryland), upon a jury's verdict, awarded compensatory and punitive damages against the host and punitive damages against the station owner. The host and the station owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The host and the owner argued that the evidence showed that the remark was made with humorous intent and was understood by all witnesses who heard the remark to be a joke. The court held that the trial judge properly submitted to the jury the question of whether the remark was received as a defamation or as a joke. The court found that the evidence, tested by the clear and convincing standard, was such as to allow the jury to conclude reasonably that the remark was not a joke in the minds of some listeners. The court further found that the evidence perspicuously supported the jury's finding that the host acted with a high awareness that the &quot;joke&quot; relative to the commentator could have been received as true, and, as such, punitive damages were properly awardable. The court found that the trial court improperly allowed the jury to render separate verdicts on the issue of punitive damages. The court noted that liability for punitive damages, where there were multiple defendants who were in a principal-agent relationship, was joint and several without regard to their relative culpability. The court further noted that the rule did not permit apportionment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that portion of the judgment that entered separate verdicts on the issue of punitive damages and remanded for a new trial on the issue of punitive damages only. The court affirmed the trial court's order in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a judgment from the Criminal Court of Baltimore City (Maryland), which refused to sentence defendant following his robbery trial as a &quot;three time offender&quot; pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 643B(c). Had the judge followed &sect; 643B(c), defendant would have been sentenced to 25 years instead of 10 years. The State asked that the sentence be vacated and that the matter be remanded for the imposition of a proper sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant rejected the opportunity to plead guilty to the robbery charge and proceeded to trial. Following the jury's verdict of guilty but before the imposition of sentence, the State filed a motion for mandatory sentence pursuant to Md. R. 734 and Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 643B(c) and (d). The trial court refused to impose sentence under &sect; 643B(c), opining that the statute was not mandatory under the circumstances. The trial court was concerned that the State only sought to use the mandatory penalty statute after defendant rejected a proposed plea agreement. The court overturned the sentence, rejecting defendant's argument that he should have been advised by the State during plea negotiations that the State intended to invoke &sect; 643B(c) should the bargain not be struck. First, the court held that &sect; 643B(c) was mandatory and that a trial judge had to consider it when imposing sentence. Second, the court held that a prosecutor was not required to give advance notice to an accused that trial on the substantive offense would be followed by a proceeding under the habitual criminal statute.</SPAN></P>

Ann. Code art. 41, &sect; 103D unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature passed &sect; 103D, which provided that a charitable organization could not pay in connection with any fund-raising activity in excess of 25 percent of the total gross income received. The Indiana corporation was in the promotion business and wanted to enter into a contract with a police organization. The corporation was unable to enter into such contract because of the 25 percent limitation. The corporation initiated an action for declaratory relief. The trial court held that the corporation was not entitled to such relief. In affirming the decision, the court found that &sect; 103D did not infringe on the First Amendment freedom of speech because it regulated speech in such a way as to minimize the encroachment on individual rights while protecting citizens from sham and fraud. Section 103D regulated charitable solicitation by penal laws and financial disclosure requirements. The section was drawn in a manner calculated to protect the public interest without unnecessarily infringing on First Amendment rights. The court also found that it was not an impermissible delegation of legislative authority because reasonable guidelines were in place to guide the Secretary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following defendant's conviction for solicitation of murder, he sought review of the decision. On review, defendant contended that there was insufficient evidence to establish the crime of criminal solicitation, that only one criminal solicitation was involved, and that the trial court erred in admitting the tape recording of the transaction. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the object of defendant's solicitation was for undercover policeman to commit murder, a felony. Therefore, the court held that the evidence sufficed to establish the crime of criminal solicitation. Further, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to show four separate criminal solicitations based upon four distinct incitements. The court reasoned that the evidence sufficed to permit a finding that it was not a lump sum singular deal, but separate and independent incitements to commit four separate and distinct acts of murder against specific named individuals and, thus, neither the separate convictions nor the separate and consecutive sentences were inappropriate. Finally, the court held that the tapes of defendant and the undercover policeman were properly admitted into evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state department of health and mental hygiene (DHMH) sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland), which ordered DHMH to pay the cost of care for a child in need of assistance (CINA) at a privately owned hospital. Appellee county department of social services (PGDSS) was initially ordered to share the financial responsibility for the child's treatment, but PGDSS was later dismissed as a party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For about two years prior to the order, the child had been receiving inpatient treatment at a privately owned hospital and her expenses were paid by her parents. When the child's parents' insurance coverage expired, they turned to the state for help and a petition was filed in the county juvenile court to have the child declared to be a child in need of assistance. The child was placed in the custody of the DHMH and the trial court directed DHMH to pay the cost of the child's care at the same privately owned hospital. The issue considered by the court on appeal was whether the juvenile court judge could order the Secretary of the DHMH to assume the obligation to pay the costs of maintaining a CINA in a private hospital, notwithstanding that no funds were budgeted or had been appropriated for that purpose by the legislature. The court ruled that the trial court was without jurisdiction to direct DHMH to shoulder the financial responsibility for child's care and treatment at the private hospital. Furthermore, no juvenile court had the authority to direct the Secretary of DHMH to pay the cost of treatment of a CINA in a private institution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was committed to a state hospital after being found not guilty of attempted rape by reason of insanity. He filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging he was illegally detained. The patient argued that former Md. Ann. Code art. 59, &sect; 27 granted him a right to a hearing on whether he could be released and the right was taken away by Md. Ann. Code art. 59, &sect; 27 A-C, which repealed the former statute without providing him any right to a hearing. The circuit court agreed. The State appealed, arguing the new statute only changed the procedure for the patient to obtain a hearing because Md. Ann. Code art. 59, &sect; 15 granted the patient the right to a hearing. The court found that if the State could bring its appeal, the argument would justify reversal. The State argued that the trial judge declared a statute unconstitutional, thus granting it the right to appeal under Md. R. Z56. The court found the trial judge did not declare that any statute was unconstitutional. The trial judge decided it was unconstitutional to confine the patient without a hearing where the statute granting the right to a hearing was repealed. The State could not bring its appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company had a franchise to provide water to a rural area. The Commission determined that the company was not providing adequate service to its customers and was unlikely to be able to provide adequate service in the future. The Commission revoked the company's right to exercise its franchise, and the trial court affirmed the Commission's decision. On the company's appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court adopted the proper standard of review. In light of the continued proceedings involving the company, the notice to show cause why the company should not be required to correct its system gave adequate notice to the company that its franchise was in jeopardy. Because a proposed rate increase would not have solved the company's financial problems, the Commission did not err in failing to consider the rate increase before the right to exercise the franchise was revoked. Although the Commission did not have the right to revoke the franchise itself, it did have the power, pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 78, &sect; 24(a), to revoke the company's right to exercise that franchise. Because the Commission did not revoke the franchise itself, there was no taking of the company's property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On defendant's original appeal, the court held that defendant had no right to appeal from an acquittal and that the verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity was an acquittal.

On second appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that with respect to the speedy trial issue, defendant did not affirmatively establish nor did the state affirmatively negate any actual prejudice, but the presumptive prejudice arising from a delay of 33 months was substantial. The court held that even the lengthy delay was in major measure either caused by defendant himself or occasioned by provisions of the law intended to benefit defendant and that there was no denial of his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland), which dismissed her suit against defendants, a board of education and others, seeking a declaration that Md. Code Ann., Educ. &sect; 7-402 (1978), which required immunizations as a pre-condition to school admission, and regulations issued thereunder, violated rights guaranteed her by U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV and by Md. Const. Decl. Rights. art. 36.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother contended she had deeply held moral convictions against vaccinating her children. She argued that the religious exemption clauses of the statute and regulations left no room for those individuals with such deeply held moral convictions. Thus, she argued that the religious exemption clauses offended the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment by favoring &quot;the protected religion&quot; and also offended the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by not protecting as well what she claimed to be her deeply held moral convictions. The court rejected these arguments. The mother's objections to the immunization program were based on her own subjective evaluation of and rejection of the benefits to the public safety and to her children derived therefrom. Her beliefs were based on purely secular considerations; they were philosophical and personal rather than religious. Such beliefs did not rise to the demands of the Religion Clauses. As the mother's claims of denial of equal protection and invasion of privacy were predicated primarily upon the validity of her Religion Clauses argument, they too were without merit.</SPAN></P>

Laws 384 (1977 Law), Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 335A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court had previously held that the common law crime of &quot;indecent exposure&quot; in Maryland had been supplanted by the 1967 express inclusion of the offense in Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 122. Thereafter, the Maryland Legislature amended the disturbing the peace statute to exclude the indecent exposure language by enacting the 1977 Act. Defendant complained that no such crime existed in Maryland at the time of his 1978 conviction, that the 1977 Act preamble was unconstitutionally vague, and that the trial court erred in denying his request to read and argue to the jury the preamble. The court held that: (1) the Maryland Legislature not only repealed the language abrogating the common law crime, but also provided the penalty for conviction of &quot;the common law crime&quot;; (2) under the revival principle, by repealing the statutory language abrogating the common law principle, the common law principle had been revived; (3) the existence of the common law crime was not affected by any statutory penalty limitation found in the 1977 Act; (4) the preamble was not an operative portion of the 1977 Act; and (5) under Md. Const. art. XV, &sect; 5, the trial court had properly declined defendant's request.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the owner repeatedly failed to pay water charges and arrears owed to the commission, the commission filed an action that sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The trial court overruled the owner's demurrer and granted the commission's motion for summary judgment. The owner appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that denial of the demurrer was proper because the commission stated sufficient grounds for equitable relief. Because the commission's pleading set forth an actual or justiciable controversy, it was not subject to demurrer because the trial court was not concerned with the question whether the commission was right, but only with whether the commission was entitled to a declaration of rights with respect to the matters alleged. In addition, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the commission because it set forth sufficient grounds for summary judgment and the owner failed to show with some precision that there was a general dispute as to a material fact. The owner's bare allegation that the amount claimed by the commission was erroneous was insufficient to defeat the summary judgment motion.</SPAN></P>

The jury found defendant not guilty on all counts of the indictment in which force or threat of force was an element, but found him guilty of engaging in perverted sexual practices.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Individuals were injured when a manufacturer's dryer exploded as it dried a hot air balloon. The court found that the trial court properly denied the manufacturer's motion for a directed verdict on the issue of negligence where there was evidence that the accident resulted from the manufacturer's negligence in designing and selling a machine that, absent an automatic cut-off switch, would, under foreseeable circumstances, become a dangerous instrument. The manufacturer was also negligent in failing to warn customers of the foreseeable potential danger. Third-party defendants were not improperly dismissed where the manufacturer's own expert testified that they were not at fault. Although punitive damages were available in product liability actions based upon the manufacturer's negligence, the injured individuals did not have a contract with the manufacturer, and thus a &quot;legal equivalent&quot; implied malice standard applied; the injured individuals did not establish that the manufacturer's actions were wanton or showed reckless indifference to others. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting gory photographs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">County school officials decided to place the parents' aphasic son in a public school facility for multiply handicapped children. The department then denied the parents' appeal and request for private school tuition funding. After a review hearing, the review board affirmed the decision of the department. The circuit court held a hearing, received additional evidence, and affirmed the review board's decision. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the circuit court. The court ruled that an amendment to the Maryland Administrative Procedures Act, Md. Ann. Code art. 41, &sect;255(d) (Cum. Supp. 1979), applied to the parents' appeal hearing in the circuit court because it was conducted after the provision became effective. Section 255(d) prohibited the circuit court from receiving additional evidence, although it could order the agency to take additional evidence. The court ruled that the parents established that the evidence was material, and that good reasons existed for their failure to present the evidence to the department.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Secretary of the Maryland Department of Personnel challenged the decision of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City (Maryland) that positions excluded from classified service were created improperly in appellees classified employees' suit under the Declaratory Judgment Act. The trial court created classified positions to replace the illegal positions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court did not require the classified employees to send notices to all of the potentially affected non-classified employees after the state legislature passed Md.

The court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded. The court found that the non-classified employees were necessary parties or had a right to be notified of their jeopardy and right to intervene because they had a significant interest that was affected by the declaration. The court held that the non-classified employees had an interest in the geographic location of their jobs. The statute did not require that the non-classified employees be given new positions in the same geographic location. The non-classified employees also had an interest in preserving their job status outside of the classified service and an interest in avoiding the potential jeopardy of having to repay past earnings in the event that their jobs were declared illegal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hospital sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Harford County (Maryland) that affirmed a decision of appellee Health Services Cost Review Commission, which reviewed the hospital's telephone charges, admission charges, room rates, out-of-county patient surcharges, and other rates under the Administrative Procedure Act, Md. Ann. Code art. 41, &sect; 255(f).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the Commission reviewed the hospital's telephone charges, admission charges, room rates, and out-of-county patient surcharges, the hospital filed an action against the Commission. The trial court affirmed the Commission's decision. The hospital appealed. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Unless the Commission's opinion violated one of the criteria permitting reversal or modification in &sect; 255(f), the trial judge had to affirm. The Commission applied a hospital-by-hospital standard of review in investigating hospitals. The court's review went little beyond its inherent power to prevent illegal, unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious administrative action. There was no such conduct by the Commission. The court did not find unconstitutionality, ultra vires conduct, unlawful procedure, an error of law, or an arbitrary or capricious decision. There was nothing unreasonable about the decision to force the hospital to use its stored financial resources to defray expenses rather than to recoup them through patient charges. The Commission's philosophy that cost-based charges were more likely to be non-discriminatory than ones using cross-subsidization was sound.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners sought review of a decree of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland), which granted judgment in favor of appellees, Mayor and Aldermen of the City of Annapolis, and found that a city code that required the owners of residential rental properties to obtain and maintain operating licenses and to pay a fee for such licenses was constitutional and valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Mayor and the Aldermen initiated the action against the owners seeking injunctive relief to enforce provisions of the code that required the owners to obtain and maintain operating licenses for owning residential rental properties and to pay a fee for such licenses. The trial court granted judgment in favor of the Mayor and the Aldermen. The owners sought review and contended that the code was unconstitutional. Pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 23A, &sect; 2 (1973), the legislative body of every incorporated municipality had the general power to pass ordinances not contrary to the general public laws that were necessary to protect and preserve the people. Further, under Md. Const. art. XI-E, &sect; 5, the legislature was authorized to place a maximum limit on the rate at which property taxes were to be imposed by any municipal corporation. The court held that the license fees imposed by the Mayor and the Aldermen were a valid regulatory measure enacted pursuant to the police powers. However, because the owners had not refused to comply with the code, injunction was an unnecessary remedy. The court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part the decree of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part a decree, which determined that the Mayor and the Aldermen were permitted to impose license fees upon the owners of residential rental property.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of transporting a handgun and sentenced to three years imprisonment. On review, he argued that the trial judge abused her discretion by failing to grant a new trial because of the administrative judge's error in denying a postponement. The court affirmed. The trial judge did not abuse her discretion by not granting a postponement when the absent witness was a co-defendant. The court held that where the absent witness was also a co-defendant and there was no showing that he would have waived his privilege against self-incrimination and exonerated defendant, the trial judge could deny the postponement of a trial. Defendant argued that the trial court erred by considering at sentencing a crime for which he was neither charged nor convicted. It was a fair inference that, but for excellent police work, the fully loaded handguns would have been used for a robbery. The court concluded that the sentence was influenced by the evidence before the trial court and not by improper considerations.</SPAN></P>

The State conceded noncompliance with the consent decree, which required that a commitment hearing had to be held within 60 days of receipt of an evaluation report. However, the State contended that the word &quot;shall&quot; as used in the decree was directory, not mandatory. Upon review, the court observed that the absence of a penalty provision in the decree indicated that the language set forth directory, not mandatory, guidelines. The individuals were not prejudiced by the delay of their commitment hearings. Further, the court was not bound by the decision of the federal court on a matter of State law. It was inconceivable that the federal court would have compelled the court to release individuals whose culpable conduct was criminal, but who did not understand that their acts were criminal. To require the release of such persons was an unacceptable sanction for the failure to hold the commitment hearings in the time proscribed. The federal court could enforce its decree through its powers of contempt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a fourth jury trial, the Criminal Court of Baltimore (Maryland) convicted defendant of felony murder and the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. Defendant appealed the convictions. He contended that the trial court erroneously refused to rule on the merits of his motion to dismiss the indictment on grounds of double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's first and second trials resulted in mistrials. His third trial resulted in a conviction, which was reversed on appeal. Defendant did not file a motion to dismiss the second or third indictments on double jeopardy grounds. On the day that the fourth trial began, he filed a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds. This motion was predicated on the first mistrial. The trial court refused to entertain the motion on the merits because it was not timely filed pursuant to Md. R. 7-36. On appeal, defendant argued that the application of R. 7-36 was unconstitutional because a double jeopardy motion to dismiss could never be waived. The court affirmed the trial court's refusal to entertain the motion and affirmed the convictions. The court held that the failure to make a mandatory motion to dismiss an indictment on double jeopardy grounds within the prescribed time limits, absent good cause to forgive the dereliction, barred the claim where the claim arguably was pregnant with constitutional merit just as surely as where the claim was utterly bereft of merit. The court found that defendant's motion was untimely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, state Department of Natural Resources (DNR), challenged an order from the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland), which dismissed its bill of complaint against appellee landowners in an enforcement action under Md. Code Ann., Nat. Res. I &sect; 9-501 (1970), in which the DNR sought restoration of wetlands knowingly filled by the landowners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state Department of Natural Resources (DNR) challenged an order that dismissed a complaint against landowners on the ground that the DNR's rules and regulations pertaining to the filling wetlands were not applicable to the private wetlands filled by the landowners. The trial court held that the DNR was powerless to require the landowners to restore those lands to their natural (or prefilled) state. The trial court held that alleged deficiencies in giving notice about legal prohibitions against filling wetlands without official permission were applicable to the lots of the landowners and were unenforceable against them. The landowners argued that they lacked constructive notice of the prohibitions, either on a statutory or constitutional basis, and that the lots did not fall within the statutory definition of wetlands. The appellate court reversed the judgment and rendered a judgment in favor of the DNR. The appellate court based its judgment on the fact that before the fill of the wetlands was completed the landowners were given actual notice that wetlands were involved and that a permit or license was required. The landowners continued to fill wetlands despite that warning.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in favor of the landowners and remanded for entry of a proper order directing restoration of the wetlands knowingly filled by the landowners. The court found that the landowners completed the filling of the wetlands in the face of actual notice that what they were doing was illegal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged the decision of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland), which convicted them of common law escape and sentenced each to terms of imprisonment consecutive to the terms they were then serving for other offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of the crime of common law escape. On review, the court reversed. As to defendant one, a charge of statutory escape was dismissed where the trial judge found the statute unconstitutional because it imposed differing penalties for escape from different institutions. The trial judge, however, failed to comply with Md. R. 735d, regarding knowing and voluntary waiver of a jury trial. As to the second defendant, the issue was whether the adoption of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 139, the statutory law of escape, abrogated the common law offense of escape. The court found that &sect; 139 simplified the common law by consolidating the three types of escape into one statute and making all escape a felony. The trial judge erroneously declared, at defendants' request, that &sect; 139 was unconstitutional. The trial judge could not, therefore, proceed pursuant to charges founded upon an &quot;unconstitutional&quot; statute nor upon the abrogated common law. Thus, defendant two's trial on the common law offense of escape was a nullity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Criminal Court of Baltimore (Maryland), which convicted him, upon a jury verdict, of a handgun violation under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 36B(b), and conspiracy to violate the Maryland statute proscribing escape from jail, Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 139(a). Co-defendant appealed the judgment convicting him of violating Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 36B(b), and delivering contraband (i.e., a handgun) to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Co-defendant, a guard, surreptitiously carried a handgun into the jail and delivered it to defendant, an inmate, who intended to use the weapon to escape. The plot was revealed before the escape occurred. As a result, defendant, co-defendant, and another individual were charged with conspiracy and weapons-related offenses. The first trial ended in a mistrial, but all three were later retried and convicted. On appeal, defendant and co-defendant raised double jeopardy, evidentiary, and Miranda issues. The court affirmed the convictions for several reasons. First, there was no prosecutorial overreaching in the form of gross negligence or intentional misconduct which would serve to activate the Double Jeopardy Clause bar to a retrial. Second, there was a sufficient relationship between the time, place, circumstances, or parties involved in the other crimes of defendant and co-defendant so as to permit the introduction of the evidence of the other crimes as being part of a common scheme. Finally, the jail officials, when interrogating defendant about the handgun's whereabouts, were acting in a dire emergency and, thus, were not required to accord him his Miranda rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment convicting defendant of a handgun violation and of conspiracy was affirmed. The judgment convicting co-defendant of a handgun violation and of delivering contraband was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Subsequent to the stop, the officer discovered guns in the vehicle. Prior to trial, defendants filed motions to suppress the evidence, asserting that their arrest was illegal, and any evidence seized thereafter was tainted. The motion to suppress was denied, and the case proceeded to trial by a jury. On appeal of defendants' convictions, the court found that all the prosecution produced in the way of justification for the stop of the vehicle in which defendants were riding was the suspicion that was aroused within the officer's mind, and that suspicion fell well short of articulable specific facts. The court then stated the motions should have been granted because there was no lawful basis for the halting of the vehicle; the stop was illegal; and all that flowed therefrom, including the recovery of the guns, was an unconstitutional seizure.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court, in its cursory questioning of defendant failed to comply with the mandatory standards of Md. R. 723(c). The court also held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear the revocation proceedings pursuant to Md. Ann.

The department filed a petition seeking the guardianship with the right of consent to adoption of the child. The lower court granted the guardianship. Upon appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the natural mother offered no proof that she would be able to resume her parental duties within a reasonable period, and because of her unfortunate limitations, she was not likely to be able at any time in the future to provide for the child's education or financial support. The court therefore concluded that it was in the best interests of the child that adoption be decreed.

The court held that in ascribing to the word &quot;impaired&quot; its common meaning, &quot;impaired&quot; was a state less than intoxication where consumption of alcohol had affected one's normal coordination.

The district court agreed and acquitted defendant, also declaring the statute unconstitutional. An appellate level determination of the constitutionality of &sect; 271A was sought by from the court. Notwithstanding the finding that he was not guilty, defendant appealed seeking a declaration that the statute be found unconstitutional. The court, however, found the statute constitutional. Defendant argued on appeal that a decision finding that the statute constitution could not apply to him retroactively. The court found that the opinion was handed down before his acquittal and was applicable to all similar cases that had not reached the judgment stage when it was handed down. Thus, the court was without authority to enter a judgment in defendant's case and, therefore, the case was remanded to the district court for judgment in light of the case in question without the court's reversal or affirmation of the judgement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife were divorced and the husband was ordered to pay alimony. Thereafter the wife began living with a man not her husband, and her 17-year old son was living in the same household. The husband filed a petition asking for revocation of his obligation to pay alimony on the grounds that his wife was living with, and being supported by, a paramour. The trial court granted the petition. The wife appealed. The court noted that before a divorce, a wife's adultery was grounds for terminating alimony. The court stated, however, that a final divorce ended the parties' rights dependent on marriage, including the right to expect the spouse to be chaste. The court, without affirming or reversing, remanded for further proceedings consistent with its opinion that alimony awarded to a wife after a final divorce could not be terminated or reduced solely because of unchaste conduct subsequent to divorce. The court directed the lower court to consider the wife's total financial situation and determine the issue, taking her unchastity into account only insofar as it related to her financial circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband was the step-parent of the child affected by the custody order. The parties had entered a separation agreement stipulating that the child would continue to reside with the husband after the parties relationship ended for as long as the child chose. When the husband filed for divorce, in an amended complaint he sought custody of the child. The wife filed a petition for removal of the claim to a circuit court and that petition was granted. Because the order of removal was final, it was appealable. The husband argued that the trial court did not have the power to grant the removal petition. The wife argued that removal was proper because the court to which she sought removal had &quot;continuing jurisdiction&quot; as the decider of an original custody award to the wife as against the child's natural father. The court found that, considering Md. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8, Md. R. 6-204, and Md. R. 542, there was no right to removal in divorce cases. The trial court, therefore, did not have authority to grant removal upon the wife's petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bookstore sought review of the judgments from the Circuit Court of Baltimore City (Maryland), which terminated the temporary injunctions against appellees, a commissioner and vice squad members, sustained the preliminary objections of the commissioner, and the dismissed the bookstore's petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bookstore was allegedly showing films in violation of Md. Ann. Code art. 66A. The commissioner and vice squad members seized the projectors from the bookstore. The seizure of the projectors not only precluded the displaying of unlicensed film, but also prevented the lawful use of the projector as a means of expression that was protected by U.S. Const. amend. I and by Md. Const. art. 40. The court held that the seizure of the projectors was unlawful and unconstitutional. It was unreasonable and amounted to a taking of property without due process of law. Thus, the seizure violated U.S. Const. amend. I and V and Md. Const. art. 23 and 40. No justification existed for the employment by law enforcement officers of an unlawful act to counter the illegal deed of the lawbreaker. That the bookstore may have broken the law did not permit police to depart from their licit purpose. The trial court was not empowered to issue injunctions. Consequently, although there may have been criminal charges pending before that court against the bookstore, the injunctive relief sought by the bookstore was not within the trial court's power to grant, even had it been so inclined.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgments. The court remanded to the trial court with specific instructions. The court ordered the commissioner and the vice squad members to pay costs.</SPAN></P>

After feeling it, he opened it and discovered three plastic &quot;baggies&quot; filled with approximately an ounce of marijuana apiece. Defendant was convicted of possession of marijuana. He appealed, contending that his pre-trial motion to suppress the marijuana evidence should have been granted. The court reversed. The court held that the search could not be justified as a search incident to an arrest because that exception to the warrant requirement encompassed only in-custody arrests. A game law citation such as the one issued was like a traffic ticket and was not an in-custody arrest. The court held further that the warden did not have probable cause to search defendant's car and that the search also exceeded the permissible scope of searches for game law violations. Therefore, the court held that the search was illegal and the evidence should have been excluded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the trial court erred in declaring &sect; 139(a) unconstitutional because the Maryland State Legislature had a rational basis for enacting differing penalties depending upon the nature of a correctional institution from which the escape was effected. The court stated that on the surface, it observed no constitutional defect in what was Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 139(a). The court commented that the difficulty, if any, with former Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 139(a) was not with the statute per se, but rather with the department of correction's housing within the correctional facility those persons who possibly did not fit within the category of youthful offenders. The court recognized that the department was under an order of a Maryland federal district court to provide additional living space for prisoners, but that the physical facilities available made compliance difficult. Whether the federal court order led to the housing of adult offenders in the Maryland Correctional Institution or the Maryland Correctional Training Center was not revealed by the records.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission entered an order directing the utility company to refund to its customers $ 31,867,000, together with accrued interest, and the trial court reversed the order. The trial court held that the commission did not have the power to order the refund and the commission sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the basic purpose of the fuel rate adjustment clause was to enable the utility company to automatically adjust its rates to reflect fluctuations in the cost of fuel from the level of costs included when base rates were established at a rate hearing. The court held that at the time the utility company filed supplement 127, no commission rule, regulation, or order prescribed any standard for the fuel rate adjustment clauses, nor did the broad language of the statute restrict the sliding scale to fuel costs. The court also held that the trial court erred in holding that supplements 127 and 132 did not effect an increase within the meaning of Md. Ann. Code art. 78, &sect; 70(c) and that the commission had full authority to require the utility company to refund such part of the increased rates as the commission found unjustified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother on behalf of her minor child sought review of a decision by the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland), which held that the paternity action against appellee putative father was barred by the two year statute of limitations as set forth in Md. Ann. Code art. 16, &sect; 66(e).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that the two-year statute of limitations provision to establish the paternity of a child, contained in &sect; 66(e), violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Because the court found that the limitation provision of Md. Ann. Code art. 16, &sect; 66(e) promoted a legitimate state interest and, at the same time, did not invade any fundamental personal rights of the child, in a constitutional sense, the child was not denied equal protection by the statutory requirement that paternity and support actions were required to be commenced within two years of birth. The court observed that the failure to bring a paternity suit within two years foreclosed the right to support from an alleged natural father. The child would not have been left without a means of support. The mother was still bound, under fear of criminal prosecution, to support her child, Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 88(b)(1), and, if necessary, the child would have been eligible to receive support from public funds. Thus, the court held that the two-year statute of limitations provided in Md. Ann. Code art. 16, &sect; 66(e) did not violate the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee was injured while employed as a merchant seaman. The employee brought a claim based on the alleged refusal of appellee employer to pay the maintenance and cure in the district court. The case was removed to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland), which ordered payment for maintenance and cure for one year. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first held that the trial court had jurisdiction. The court held that in personam jurisdiction existed with respect to a foreign corporation if service of process was validly effected upon its resident agent in Maryland and at least one of the jurisdictional criteria set forth in Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 6-103(b), was shown to exist. The court held that the employer met, at least, the criteria set forth in &sect; 6-103(b)(1), (2), if not &sect; 6-103(b)(4) as well, and accordingly, the trial court had appropriate jurisdiction over the employer. The court then held the employer's cross appeal was without merit. The court affirmed the judgment as to maintenance and cure, holding that the duty to provide maintenance and cure was upon both the ship and its owner. Although arising out of the employment relationship between the seaman and the shipowner, the duty was not purely a contractual obligation. The court held that the employee's claim for compensatory damages and counsel fees was not warranted because the employee had not shown any evidence that the employer's actions were unreasonable or arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a bank with two rifles and held bank employees hostage before surrendering to the police. He pled not guilty by reason of insanity to an indictment, but he was found guilty of false imprisonment and assault. On appeal, defendant contended that the admission of opinions of psychiatrists who were not called to testify on the issue of legal responsibility violated his right to confrontation. He also urged that the trial judge erred in refusing to permit cross-examination of lay opinions as to sanity and/or rationality. The court reversed the judgment of conviction because (1) a hospital record containing the opinions of the psychiatrists was admitted into evidence without limitation; (2) the jury was asked to accept as true the psychiatrists' opinions that defendant was sane at the time he entered the bank; (3) the opinions pertained to defendant's ultimate guilt and required direct testimony; and (4) the psychiatrists were not unavailable to appear in court. The court held that the judge properly excluded opinions from lay witnesses on the issue of sanity or defendant's rationality because the witnesses were not competent to testify on the issue of responsibility.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At a preliminary hearing a month after defendant's arrest, defense counsel made an oral motion to suppress the admission of evidence seized in a warrantless search and seizure at the time of the arrest. The trial court denied the motion. A few weeks later, a three count criminal information was filed charging defendant with violating Maryland's narcotic laws. Defendant was tried without a jury. Prior to the trial, defense counsel renewed his oral motion to suppress the evidence seized at the time of the arrest. The trial court denied the motion to suppress because defense counsel had not complied with Md. R. 736 by filing a motion to suppress in writing within 30 days of defendant's first appearance before the trial court. Defense counsel argued that rule 736 was unconstitutional. The court held that rule 736 was constitutional and found that the failure of defendant to comply with rule 736 was not cured by his oral motion to suppress at the preliminary hearing. The court further held that defendant's remedy, if any, was in the Post Conviction Procedure Act, Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect;&sect; 645A-645J (Cum. Supp. 1977).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The telephone company was a private corporation. A complaint was lodged with that corporation by one of its subscribers, a neighbor of defendant. In response to that complaint, the commercial manager ordered that the pen register be placed on defendant's telephone. The placing of the pen register was already fait accompli before the State became aware of its existence. There was no state action such as was required to engage the gears of U.S. Const. amends. IV or XIV, or the exclusionary rule. The court held that freedom of speech did not encompass the right to abuse the telephone with the specific intent to annoy and harass the recipient of the call. The evidence was legally sufficient to establish one pattern of repetitive calls on one date. There was a distinct and separate pattern of repetitive calls six days later. The court held that the two convictions did not constitute double jeopardy. The court held that the jury instructions actually given adequately and fairly set forth the applicable law. Defendant had no right to the exact language of his requested instructions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court convicted defendant of two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon, and one count of unlawfully carrying a handgun. The court affirmed the murder and handgun convictions and vacated the robbery convictions. The warrantless search of defendant's home was proper because the wife voluntarily gave her consent. Defendant's confession was properly admitted because he voluntarily waived his right to counsel and voluntarily confessed. Although the warrantless search of defendant's truck was illegal, the erroneously admitted evidence was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt.

Defendant was convicted of false pretenses by obtaining merchandise with a bad check. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court improperly admitted evidence of 17 bad checks without a showing that she had written the checks. Defendant also claimed that a jury instruction had improperly shifted the burden of proof to her. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case, holding that: (1) admitting the 17 checks gave the jury the impression that defendant had written these checks, so defendant was entitled to a new trial; and (2) the trial court should have instructed the jury that they were permitted, but not required, to infer the existence of an intent to defraud from the presentation of a worthless check not made good within 10 days unless, considering all the evidence presented, they had a reasonable doubt as to the existence of that intent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with first and second degree rape, first, second, third, and fourth degree sexual offense, sodomy, kidnapping, robbery, larceny of goods with a value of less than $ 100, receiving stolen goods with a value of less than $ 100, and common law assault and battery. On appeal, defendant argued that in light of present social standards, the sentence of life in prison for the crime of rape in the first degree was &quot;cruel and unusual punishment.&quot; The court held that: (1) defendant's argument that if the facts had been a little different, the evidence would not have supported the first degree rape charge and the sentence to life in prison did not provide grounds to reduce the offense to anything other than first degree rape to which defendant had pleaded guilty; (2) a life sentence could only be imposed when an accused had been found guilty of employing the most reprehensible of methods in carrying out the heinous offense of vaginal intercourse against his victim's will; and (3) the imposition of a life sentence for rape in the first degree was constitutionally permissible.</SPAN></P>

The landlord had filed an application for an extraordinary rent increase in conformance with Montgomery County, Md., Code &sect; 29-51(b)(1974).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord's application for extraordinary rent increase was initially granted then on appeal the commission denied and the commission's order constituted final administrative action. The landlord filed an action in circuit court challenging the constitutionality of the rent control article and the trial judge ruled against the landlord. The landlord filed and was denied a motion to revise the judgment. The landlord then filed a petition for rehearing before the commission, the commission denied rehearing, and the landlord instituted the present action. The court remanded and dismissed the appeal finding that the landlord was not entitled to further judicial review of agency action. The court held the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3-401 et seq. (1974) mandated dismissal, which provided in Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Code Ann. &sect; 3-409(b) that if a statute provided a special form of remedy for a specific type of case, that statutory remedy had to been followed. The court held the doctrine of res judicata barred the action with respect to the landlord's request to raise rents and the landlord's claim for reconsideration was untimely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions and all the verdicts were affirmed. Defendant then filed the post conviction petition and the lower court determined that he was not afforded genuine representation in regard to his direct appeal because his counsel did not heed his express direction to raise the issues of judicial prejudice and speedy trial rights. The court found that the belated appeal attempted again to raise two questions that it had answered on defendant's first appeal, and a third question that the post conviction court had considered and rejected as lacking merit. The court determined that the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act, codified at Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 645A (Supp. 1960), did not provide the lower court with the jurisdiction to review appellate counsel's conduct or the issues raised or waived on appeal once the original appeal had been entered. The court ruled that it had no jurisdiction to hear a second appeal arriving from the route thus traveled. Dismissing the appeal, the court held that a second appeal was not permitted for either picking up issues overlooked or rehashing after an adverse decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The architect agreed to provide services for the construction of a school and agreed to be paid a certain percentage of the total construction contract. Legislation governing state school construction, Md. Ann. Code art. 77, &sect; 47(a), (c), was subsequently enacted which limited architectural fees assumed by the state to a percentage less than that in the architect's contract. After passage of the legislation, the county council then rescinded a bond ordinance by which it had conditionally approved the construction project in question. Application of the statute resulted in a lower payment than the contract price. The trial court sustained the county council's demurrer. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the architect's contract rights were inferentially established at a time when the education board was authorized to act and after the county council passed the bond authority to fund the construction project. The bill authorizing the funding was not repealed until well over a year later. When the bond ordinance was repealed, the rescission could not constitutionally, and did not by its own terms, impair the obligation of the valid, binding, subsequently performed contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an extrajudicial identification on the grounds that it was impermissibly suggestive.

Defendant challenged the jury instruction given regarding first degree murder, arguing that the instruction failed to include the word &quot;aforethought.&quot; The court was persuaded that looking at the instruction as a totality, the necessary notion that the killing be thought out in advance was communicated to the jury even though the trial court did not use the word &quot;aforethought.&quot; The court did not find that the underlying felony of kidnapping merged into the ensuing felony-murders because there was clear evidence establishing premeditation, not felony-murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions arose from an incident that occurred where the mother's daughter was beaten with a belt by the stepfather for playing hookey from school.

The stepfather also argued that he should not have been convicted because he was not in a parental relationship with the child. Finally, the mother argued that the evidence did not sustain the conviction against her. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the statutes were not unconstitutionally vague; (2) the trial court should have granted the mother's motion for acquittal because the mother did not know that the stepfather would beat the child so severely with a belt and the evidence was legally insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the mother aided or abetted the stepfather in his &quot;cruel or inhumane treatment&quot; of the child; and (3) the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find that at the time of the beating the stepfather was in loco parentis to the child, so the trial judge was correct in denying the stepfather's motion for judgment of acquittal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney general sought and received an order that permanently enjoined appellants from engaging in an overcharging policy, and that assessed civil fines against them under the Maryland Consumer Protection Act (Act). On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the evidence was legally sufficient to sustain the finding that appellants had engaged in a deliberate scheme to defraud consumers by a systematic pattern of overcharging for fish. The court refused to rule on the Act's constitutionality because that issue had not been questioned at the trial stage. There was nothing in the language of the Act that precluded the attorney general from seeking the sanctions available in the courtroom unless the lesser administrative remedies had been tried first. The court also refused to review the civil penalties imposed upon the employee because the question of the applicability of the civil penalty provision of the Act to &quot;employees&quot; was never raised at the trial below.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner personal representative of a suicide victim appealed from the decision of the Circuit Court for Allegany County (Maryland), which held that it was unlawful for the representative to acquire any of the estate of the victim because the decedent murdered his wife before he committed suicide.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a declaratory judgment proceeding brought by the personal representative of the husband's estate, the trial court held that under Maryland law neither a murderer not those claiming under him may acquire any of the estate of the victim and that the individually held property of the husband passed to the heirs of the wife under the disputed common disaster provision. The court reasoned that when the decedent killed his wife, he severed the relationship of tenants by the entireties between himself and the victim, thereby rendering inoperative the general principle that the survivor succeeds to the whole of the property. The court also held that because the husband and the victim died within 30 days of each other, the conclusive presumption of the victim's survivorship set forth in the husband's will was operative, and controlled the disposition of the husband's individually-owned property and one-half the interest in the property held as a tenant by the entireties with the victim. The husband's interest passed to the victim's estate, and each child would receive an additional one-eighth interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subject to a lease agreement, the assignee was not allowed to challenge a determination by the state assessor that improvements to the leased land were subject to real estate taxes.

During that appeal the lessor filed its bill in the trial court for declaratory judgment and injunction. The board decided in favor of the assignee, which was appealed to the tax court. The trial court then denied the lessor's motion, finding that the lease terms were against public policy. On appeal the court vacated the trial court's decision. The court held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the issue. The court noted that the legislature provided a detailed system of hearings and appeals for the disposition of controversies over taxes due on property in the state. The court found that where statute provided a special form of remedy for a specific type of case, that remedy had to be followed. The court stated that tax assessment cases required a special form of statutory remedy to prohibit collateral attack and that the tax court was the proper forum for the hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor sought to enforce a mechanics' lien claim in its bill in equity pursuant to a contract with the owners for materials and labor the contractor furnished in the construction of buildings on the owners' property. The contractor's complaint alleged that the contractor had performed its contractual obligations; that it furnished materials and performed work within 180 days of filing its lien claim; and that no payment had been made. The owners demurred on the ground that the complaint was insufficient because the lien claim failed to meet the requirements of Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 9-105. The trial court sustained the owners' amended demurrer to the contractor's bill in equity. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order with modification. The court held that the demurrer was properly sustained for the bill's failure to describe the building or buildings, to situate them in a reasonable locale, and to describe the nature or kind of work or the kind and amount of materials furnished.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was involved in a bank robbery and subsequent difficult escape. He was tried and convicted in the federal court, then the state brought charges on the same conduct. The state trial court deferred ruling on appellant's motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds until after the trial on the merits. The court held that the trial court's deferral was harmless error. Deferral was ordinarily a reversible error; however, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the motion was based on a claim that was patently frivolous; conviction by the federal court on the same state charges did not constitute double jeopardy. The court held that the delay in bring appellant to trial in the state, under the circumstances surrounding the exercise of separate sovereign powers by the federal government and the state, was not unconstitutional. Inasmuch as the offense of assault with intent to maim, disfigure, or disable was charged and not proven, and the proven offense of assault with intent to avoid arrest was not charged, the court reversed that conviction. The evidence was sufficient to prove attempted robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon and robbery of the getaway vehicle.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed her conviction of assault with intent to maim and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony, which carried a minimum mandatory five-year sentence, alleging that her revocation of her guilty plea was not voluntary. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that defendant's constitutional right to a fair trial, and her ability to waive that right, did not carry with it a right to insist on a waiver of that right. The court noted that the United States Supreme Court had specifically held that states had the authority to prohibit altogether the accepting of pleas to lesser included offenses, and further that Md. R. Crim. Causes 4-721, 4-722 specifically authorized the trial judge to refuse to accept a guilty plea or to strike a guilty plea in the interest of justice.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the error was harmless but vacated the decree for revision. The court denied the corporation's other arguments entered against the trial court's decree. The court found that the demurrer filed by the corporation on constitutional grounds against Maryland's Mechanics' Lien Statute was not raised until eight months after the lien enforcement action commenced and the attack was not on the then-existence of the lien, but rather the whole proceeding. The court concluded that it was not unreasonable to permit the subcontractor to pursue his claims without returning him to square one.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees adopted the ordinance to prevent the extension, expansion, or enlargement of nonconforming use of land and to provide a tolerance period during which the nonconforming uses were to be rolled back. The ordinance was a response to the overcrowding in portions of the city that created slums. The general rule was that zoning ordinances were entitled to a presumption of constitutional validity and that the burden was upon the party attacking the ordinance to establish its unconstitutionality. Appellants needed to show that there was no real and substantial relation between the ordinance and the purpose for which it was enacted. On appeal, the court affirmed the finding that the ordinance was constitutional. The scheme adopted for the rollback of nonconforming use was a valid exercise of the city's police power. The amortization scheme as adopted in the rollback provisions provided for an amortization period of 15 years and was not an unlawful taking of property without due process and just compensation. The classification established by the ordinance was a reasonable legislative classification to alleviate urban blight.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consultant was enjoined on complaint by the county bar association from the unauthorized practice of law. On appeal, the court determined that the consultant's dealings before a county personnel board, while not amounting to the filing of pleadings in the trial of a contested case, were something more than the mere mechanical filling out of forms. In addition, the consultant's preparation of two &quot;agreements&quot; constituted the unauthorized practice of law. The findings of fact that the consultant was engaged in the unauthorized practice of law were amply supported by the evidence. The injunction, however, was too broad in that it enjoined the consultant from doing things that he was legally entitled to do, such as fill out forms supplied by the Workmen's Compensation Commission or perform other purely mechanical functions. The injunction also forbade the consultant to interpret or attempt to interpret the provisions of any rule, regulation, statute or constitution for himself. Such a prohibition was not only unconstitutional, but also utterly impossible to enforce. The matter was remanded to the circuit court without affirming.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Criminal Court of Baltimore (Maryland) convicting him, following a jury trial, on two counts of distributing a controlled substance, heroin, in violation of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 286, and sentencing him to two concurrent 10 year sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in failing to grant a motion to compel disclosure of the name of an informant used by the State in it investigation. In a pretrial motion upon which a full hearing was conducting immediately prior to trial, defendant sought to compel the State to reveal the name of an unidentified informant who introduced a detective to defendant. The testimony of the detective and two other police officers engaged in surveillance disclosed that the informant met with defendant once for the purpose of setting up a meeting between the detective and defendant for a purchase of heroin. The court held that the facts in the instant matter clearly supported the State's privilege at trial to protect the identity of its informant. The uncontroverted testimony revealed that the informant played no role in the actual negotiations or the sale of the illegal drugs. Defendant further contended that he was denied his Sixth Amendment speedy trial right. Under the facts presented, the court could not conclude that there was substantial delay so as to give rise to a presumption of prejudice. The lapse of eight months while significant, was not inordinate.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the trial court correctly rejected the attack upon the constitutionality of the disciplinary powers vested in the police commissioner and in the manner in which such powers were exercised. The court found that the trial court should have examined any inference, drawn by an agency, of the existence of a fact not shown by direct proof, to see if that inference reasonably followed from other facts which were shown by direct proof. With regard to conclusions reached by an agency, the court stated that the trial court should have examined them to see whether reasoning minds could reasonably reach that conclusion from facts in the record before the agency by direct proof or permissible inference. The court determined with regard to facts, the trial court should see if there was evidence to support each fact found and that it could not substitute its assessment of credibility for that made by the agency.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants shoplifted from a store. Their shoplifting at a second store was observed, and police were notified.

The officers searched the car and found the stolen merchandise. Defendants moved to suppress the evidence seized in the search. The trial courts denied the motions and convicted defendants. Defendants appealed. The court affirmed based on defendants' lack of standing to challenge the search. Defendants appealed again. The higher court remanded with directions to consider the search on the merits. The court affirmed. It was the law of the case that defendants had standing. The police action was not unreasonable. The officers were summoned by the yard owner and were performing a community caretaking function. The car was illegally parked, which gave the officers a compelling reason to take it into custody to custody to determine if it was stolen and abandoned.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a committed individual, challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City (Maryland), which denied the individual's request for release from a state hospital, upon the filing of a petition pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 59, &sect; 27, which provided for the petitioning for release following commitment after being found not guilty of a crime by reason of insanity at the time of the commission of the act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual was confined to a state hospital after he was found not guilty of a homicide by reason of insanity. His subsequent petition for release was denied. The court affirmed, holding first that the individual could not protest that he was denied an administrative remedy when he neither applied for administrative release nor argued that he was entitled to administrative procedure. Further, the court noted that a person was not afforded less protection by a judicial procedure which required proof by a preponderance of the evidence, but which also granted the important right of jury trial, than he was given by an administrative procedure before a single hearing officer, even though the State was required there to prove the issue by clear and convincing evidence. Second, the trial court properly assigned him the burden of proving sanity because, having overcome the presumption of sanity in defense, the individual's status, derived from his adjudication of insanity, was that he was not sane. To alter that status, he had to act affirmatively by asserting his sanity under Md. Ann. Code art. 59, &sect; 15, and follow with sufficient proof to overcome the inertia of the trier of facts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, rental owners, tenants, and management agents (renters), sought review of the decision of the Court of Appeals of Maryland, which held that the doctrine of collateral estoppel barred the constitutional attack upon the enabling act, 1976 Md. Laws 925, and the Code of Public Local Laws of Prince George's County &sect;&sect; 75-5 through 75-13. The renters had filed a bill of complaint as a class action against appellee county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The enabling act authorized and empowered the governing body of the county to impose a local multifamily occupancy tax on rentals arising in certain multifamily dwelling units. Prior litigation regarding the enabling act sustained the constitutionality of the prior version of the act and the earlier county bill. The renters now appealed various amendments to the enabling act, which included the imposition of personal liability upon a landlord for the tax collected, but held harmless any landlord who acted in good faith to collect the tax. The court affirmed, in part, and reversed, in part, the lower court's decision and remanded the case for passage of an amended declaration and order, finding that the tax sought to be imposed was an excise tax and not proscribed by Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 15. The court further found that the changes to the enabling act were so extensive in character as to cause the doctrine of collateral estoppel to be inapplicable in the subject litigation. Further, the court held that actual identity of the parties in a class action was not required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers owned property, which upon their request was rezoned, and as a result, their tax assessment increased dramatically. The taxpayers later requested a reassessment and a tax official recommended to the appellate tax court that the taxpayers were entitled to a slight reduction on their assessments. The tax court issued an order authorizing such and the taxpayers appealed to the state tax court and brought a declaratory action against appellants in the trial court, seeking to enjoin the collection of such taxes. The trial court granted the taxpayers' motion for summary judgment and remanded the cause to appellants for further proceedings and appellants sought further review. The court remanded the action to the trial court, holding that the trial judge erred in: 1) finding that the taxpayers had met their burden by claiming that appellants' actions were arbitrary as a matter of law because they allegedly pulled the 25 percent increase figure from the air when it actually represented a uniform policy employed by appellants; and 2) holding that the absence of a hearing by appellants was arbitrary as a matter of law where a hearing was held by the appellate tax court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the taxpayers' action to the trial court, with costs to be shared among the parties, for a determination on the limited constitutional issue still lingering after being raised in the parties' motions for summary judgment in the taxpayers' declaratory action against appellants, protesting an increase in the taxpayers' tax assessments on certain property and seeking to enjoin the collection of such taxes.</SPAN></P>

All of the witnesses who were disclosed in the state's bill of particulars and in its answer to a discovery motion were available for interviews by defendant prior to trial. Defendant's demand for political contributions, and his threat of discharge from office unless that demand was met, fell within the boundaries of the common law offense of misconduct in office.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank's leased premises, located among various tracts that were zoned for commercial and retail uses, had been originally zoned for heavy commercial use. After 20 years in which no such development occurred in the area, the county adopted a comprehensive rezoning plan that resulted in the property's reclassification for residential use. The rezoning plan was the subject of extensive administrative hearings and judicial challenges; however, the bank argued that it did not learn of the rezoning until it applied for a building permit. Among other things, the bank argued that the rezoning was a mistake and that the action deprived it of all reasonable use of the property. The court, in reversing the trial court's judgment, disagreed. First, the court applied a strong presumption in favor of the correctness of the original zoning and the rezoning and determined that the bank failed to carry its burden to show that the county made a mistake or error in respect thereto. Next, noting that the bank at least had the opportunity to challenge the rezoning when it was challenged previously, the court rejected the argument that the rezoning was an unconstitutional taking.</SPAN></P>

The State proffered the testimony of a police officer who described the circumstances of two breakings and the personal property stolen. Respondent confessed to his participation in the crimes. After the hearing, the juvenile court ordered that its exclusive original jurisdiction be waived because respondent was an unfit subject for juvenile rehabilitation measures given that he was 18 years old and his acts were serious in nature. Respondent opposed the waiver of jurisdiction. On appeal, the court held that pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Md. Cts. &amp; Jud.

In addition, the court reasoned that his timely demand therefor divested the district court of its jurisdiction with respect to both the offense under &sect; 11-902(a) and the offense under Baltimore, Md., City Code art. 66 1/2, &sect; 11-902(b), and the criminal court properly acquired jurisdiction over the offenses, both arising from the same circumstances. Finally, the court determined that defendant, once under jurisdiction of the criminal court by reason of demand in the district court for a jury trial, was entitled to a trial by jury on any criminal charge regardless of the sentence authorized, even though a jury trial was not constitutionally mandated.</SPAN></P>

The trial court issued a judgment that granted the condemnation petition for urban renewal purposes.

The court noted that Baltimore, Md., Code of Public Laws &sect; 21-26, as amended by the 1972 Md. Laws ch. 420, authorized the mayor and the city council to utilize a &quot;quick take&quot; procedure for condemning the property. The court did not find any constitutional defect in such a procedure. The court also held that Baltimore, Md., Ordinance 152, &sect; 26(H) did set up adequate standards to guide the city housing department and the city housing commissioner in exercising the powers conferred to them for urban redevelopment. The court concluded that the mayor and the city council acted properly in condemning the property pursuant to the &quot;quick take&quot; procedure.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee mother served as the limited partner and appellant son as the general partner in a limited partnership. After the mother filed a petition seeking to dissolve the partnership, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) ordered dissolution, appointed an auditor as a &quot;trustee in liquidation,&quot; and enjoined the son to remain as manager of the partnership during the period of dissolution. Appellant challenged the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order, amending it to substitute the word &quot;receiver&quot; for &quot;trustee in liquidation.&quot; It first held that the trustee in litigation was a receiver because his duties were that of a receiver; therefore, it stated, he should be designated as such. Stating that a court of equity could appoint a receiver for the purpose of dissolving a limited partnership, it held that the appointment of the receiver was proper. It held that the dissolution itself was proper, stating that once the son, through his attorney, expressed a desire that the partnership be dissolved, that concession was binding upon him. It held that the trial court did not err in enjoining the son to remain as manager of the partnership during the period of dissolution, finding that there was no evidence that the son was devoting his full time to this duty or that the injunction was in any way so oppressive as to work a hardship on him. Nor, it held, was there any evidence that delaying compensation for his services until the auditor's final report placed the son in a fiscally unsound position. It noted that the son was the only person who knew the day-to-day operations of the business.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court, sitting as a court of equity, granted the injunction sought by the wife in her action for divorce, alimony, custody and support, restraining further alleged harassment by the husband against the wife. When the husband appeared in opposition, the circuit court granted his motion to vacate the injunction for lack of jurisdiction. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 3-603 (a), the circuit court was not sitting in the exercise of its general and ordinary equitable jurisdiction, but as a divorce court, and was, therefore, governed by the rules and principles established in the ecclesiastical courts of England. The court held that because those ecclesiastical courts did not have the authority to issue an injunction like the one imposed against the husband neither did the circuit court. The court acknowledged that this jurisdictional limitation was antiquated and served no rational purpose and urged the legislature to correct it.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that there was sufficient evidence presented to support the jury's decision that defendant made the phone calls with the intent to annoy, abuse, torment, harass, or embarrass the recipients. Defendant's rights were not violated when his motion for a new trial was heard out of his presence because the motion was not considered part of the trial. The prosecution was permitted to impeach defendant with an old prior conviction because it was an infamous crime. Defendant volunteered his grounds for objecting to the question. Because defendant failed to state all of the grounds for his objection to the impeachment question, he waived his right to challenge the conviction on the basis that he was not represented by counsel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer had employed the claimant for a period of time, and the claimant voluntarily resigned. Subsequently, the claimant worked for other employers and applied for unemployment compensation when he lost his job. Under Md. Ann.

Because the employer had employed the claimant during the base period, the employer had to pay a pro rata share of the benefits. The executive director of the Department ruled that charging of the claimant's benefits to the employer's experience-rating was proper, and the Board and the trial court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional. The court held that the unemployment tax conformed to U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant was convicted and imprisoned in the federal court for violating laws pertaining to controlled dangerous substances. The commission denied the applicant's request for a license to practice veterinary medicine at the racetracks and denied him the privileges of the grounds. The circuit court affirmed. The applicant appealed. The court held that despite the mootness of the case because it involved a license for a year that had ended, the controversy had continued vitality and the relevant rules of the commission continued in force. The court affirmed because the commission properly invoked the provisions of Maryland Racing Commission Rule 09.10.24.02 to refuse a license upon conviction of a crime after the jury entered a guilty verdict against the applicant in a criminal action in a court of competent jurisdiction. The court held that the commission, recognizing the need for prompt action to preserve the integrity of horseracing, properly interpreted its rule as not requiring exhaustion of appellate procedures. The court held that the rule was not vague as applied to the applicant who was convicted of a specific, serious offense that was related to horseracing.</SPAN></P>

Ann. Code art. 101, &sect; 33, appellees were not obligated to provide workmen's compensation benefits because the employer had already provided pension benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured while on the job for the state employer. The employee was granted a life pension for the injury under the state pension system. The employee then sought workmen's compensation benefits, which were awarded, but later were discharged because of the life pension. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that Md. Ann. Code art. 101, &sect; 33 must be interpreted to apply to cases involving permanent disability, and therefore, the payment of the pension providing a benefit equal to or better than any benefit provided for in Md. Ann. Code art. 101 satisfied and discharged in full the liability or obligation of the state employer for any benefit under the Maryland Workmen's Compensation law.The court further found that the employee's life pension granted under Md. Ann. Code art. 73B, was a benefit or gratuity provided by the state entirely at its expense, and therefore was not a contract, which would not be subject to impairment. The court reasoned that pension was defined under Md. Ann. Code art. 73B, &sect; 1(17) as payments for life derived from money provided by the state, and not from any contribution of the employee.</SPAN></P>

Defendant one was convicted to a total of 20 years, and defendant two was sentenced to a total of 5 years. Defendants sought review and contended that the wiretap order was invalid under Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2510-2520. The court found that the Act required the naming of a person in the intercept or application when the law enforcement authorities had probable cause to believe that the individual was committing the offense for which the wiretap was sought. The court determined that wiretapping to collect general intelligence about individuals was prohibited under the Act and further found that the identification of known persons was a precondition to a valid intercept order. The court found that the State's failure to follow strict compliance with the Act and the failure to name defendant one in the wiretap prevented the introduction of any evidence derived from the wiretap against him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father instituted an action in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) to prevent a post-mortem examination on the body of his son. The trial court denied the relief sought by the father to temporarily and permanently enjoin appellees, hospital, state medical examiner, and deputy medical examiner (collectively state), from tampering with his son's body. The father appealed the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The right of the state to conduct a post-mortem examination of the son was challenged on religious grounds. The father, an Orthodox Jew, asserted that the tenets of his religion did not permit post-mortem examinations. However, the medical examiner was obligated by law to take charge of the son's body. Further, it was a &quot;medical examiner case&quot; in that the son was only 18 years of age and in apparent good health when he suddenly died; thus, the medical examiner had to investigate the death to determine its cause. The challenge to the law was bottomed on constitutional &quot;freedom of religion&quot; rights. The court determined that the father had a justiciable right in his son's body as would permit him to seek equitable relief from untoward interference with the father's possession and custody of that body for the purpose of decent burial. Nonetheless, the court found that the religious practices of the father were properly abridged by the state in the application of the statutes concerning post-mortem examinations because there were compelling state interests which outweighed the interest of the father in his religious tenets. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment denying injunctive relief sought by the father to prohibit a post-mortem examination of his son's body.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was direct evidence adduced at the trial sufficient in law to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime of robbery with a deadly weapon was committed and that defendant was in exclusive possession of the stolen money. To be sufficient to justify a conviction in a criminal case, the admissible evidence adduced must show or support a rational inference of an accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The unexplained, exclusive possession of recently stolen goods permitted the inference that the possessor was the thief. The court held that the charge to the jury on this inference did not infringe defendant's privilege against self-incrimination. The mere fact that there was some evidence tending to explain the possession consistent with innocence did not bar the trial court from instructing the jury on the inference. The trier of fact weighed the explanation to determine whether it was reasonable, plausible, or satisfactory. The possession of the stolen money provided evidence by rational inference that defendant stole it. Such evidence was clearly sufficient to enable the jury to find the criminal agency of defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the confession was inadmissible because the state did not show that defendant effectively waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to counsel and because it was the fruit of a poisonous tree. The court also noted that the officer's detention of defendant both before and during his interrogation was unauthorized for lack of probable cause. The binoculars were therefore inadmissible because the state did not establish that the officers obtained them by means sufficiently distinguishable to purge the evidence of the primary taint. The court determined that its exclusionary rule analysis applied to defendant's detention, which was unlawful under the Fourth Amendment, as well as to his confession, which was illegal under the Fifth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of delinquency entered against defendant because the trial court improperly admitted the binoculars that the state charged him with stealing at his adjudicatory hearing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland), which convicted him of murder in the second degree and assault with intent to murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that: (1) the evidence was insufficient to submit the charges of second-degree murder and assault with intent to murder to the jury; (2) the trial court erroneously instructed the jury on the use of a deadly weapon; and (3) a instruction to the effect that malice may have been presumed and that the burden was upon him to show such mitigation as would have reduced the crime to manslaughter denied him due process. Upon review, the court reversed and remanded the judgment of the trial court. A constitutional allocation of the burden of persuasion in an assault with intent to murder case was mandated just as surely as was a constitutional allocation of the burden of persuasion in a felonious homicide case. Looking at the facts in a light most favorable to defendant, his companion was neither an aggressor nor a mutual combatant. He was under unprovoked attack from at least one and possibly two persons. Under the circumstances, defendant was entitled to intervene in defense of his friend.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a heated argument, the victim approached defendant and the victim reached back into his hip pocket. In response, defendant pulled a gun from his pocket and shot the victim. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in instructing the jury as to the burden of a defendant in a criminal case. On appeal, the court held that the challenged instruction was a correct statement of law at the time that it was given, but determined that it was constitutionally infirm. The court noted that the old rule was that an accused had the burden of proving that he acted in hot blood in order to reduce murder to manslaughter. Further, the court ruled that the question of mitigation was a jury issue in the case and that the instruction that it was defendant's burden to show mitigation was an unconstitutional allocation of the burden of persuasion. The court indicated that the fatal flaw in the instruction was the erroneous allocation to defendant of the burden of persuasion on the question of justification or excuse. The court concluded that the self-defense instruction as given was consistent with the law, but that it was unconstitutional because it placed the burden of proof on defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder after stabbing to death a man with whom he had a violent argument. The court found that the jury instructions were erroneous. The court relied upon a principle recently handed down in a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court which stated that the Due Process Clause required the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of the heat of passion or sudden provocation when the issue was properly presented in a homicide case. This principle was entitled to retroactive application as to several of the instructions given at defendant's trial. One of the erroneous instructions given here dealt with the issue of proof of malice. The jury was instructed that an intentional killing gave rise to a presumption of malice. Such an instruction relieved the prosecution of its burden of negating mitigation and placed the burden upon defendant of proving such mitigation as would lower murder to manslaughter. This instruction did not comply with the rule that the prosecution was required to prove each and every element of its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The court further found retroactive application of this principle to affirmative defenses.</SPAN></P>

On cross-examination, inquiry was made as to whether the witnesses had ever heard that defendant was found guilty and fined for an assault of a police officer. The court held that wide discretion was given to the trial judge to determine whether to permit such a cross-examination. The presentation of character witnesses by defendant opened the door to cross-examination concerning defendant's prior arrests or convictions, Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 9-115.

In 1975, the trial court ratified and confirmed the sale. On appeal, the court affirmed the order of the trial court. The court found that the mortgage to the third party was defective as originally recorded and was a nullity as to subsequent creditors without actual notice until the enactment of Md.

The court held that &sect; 4-109(a) eliminated the possibility of such a creditor's exercising a lien paramount to the &quot;cured&quot; mortgage and that the statute barred any prior or subsequent creditor of the mortgagor from seeking to exercise a lien on the mortgagor's property that was superior to the &quot;cured&quot; mortgage if the creditor did not judicially commence his challenge to the mortgage by July 1, 1973.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of a controlled dangerous substance. During a break in the trial, shortly after the trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress and to dismiss, defendant disappeared. The trial court held the trial in defendant's absence and he was convicted. Defendant was present for sentencing, and at that hearing, the trial court held that he was in contempt of court for failing to appear at his trial. On appeal, defendant's possession conviction was affirmed but his contempt conviction was vacated and remanded for a hearing. Defendant was in constructive criminal contempt for voluntarily failing to appear at his trial, as his absence did not interrupt the order of the courtroom or interfere with the conduct of business as the trial proceeded in his absence. Because it was not direct contempt, the trial court erred by summarily punishing him. The trial court should have followed the proceedings under Md. R.

The State also appealed the refusal to hold defendant in contempt for not complying with an order directing him to submit to examination by institution staff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Whether, as the State contended, the circuit judge declared provisions of Md. Ann. Code art. 31B dealing with the institution unconstitutional, or he, as defendant contended, did not reach that result, was irrelevant. The court dismissed the appeals. The court was without authority to consider the record. The circuit judge did not declare any portions of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, the Criminal Code under which defendant was convicted, to be wholly or partly unconstitutional, and, therefore, the record should not have been transmitted to the court. It was for the legislature to deem it desirable to amend Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 3-706 so as to provide for appellate review whenever a person was released from confinement as a result of a trial judge's declaring any state law wholly or partially unconstitutional.

The inmate brought an appeal arguing that the delay between his commitment and his trial was so great that it denied him due process of law. The court affirmed the commitment. The court held that the six months designation for the filing of the written report of the examination of a possible defective delinquent was directory and not mandatory. Therefore, the inmate was not entitled to have the report of the examination of him filed within six months as a matter of statutory right. Md. Ann. Code art. 31B, &sect; 7(a) permits permit extension of the allowable time in the case of a non-cooperative defendant who resists examination. Such was the case with the inmate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of murdering her husband, the circuit court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment. The circuit court then ordered that defendant serve only eight years of the sentence, suspended the balance of the punishment, and denied the state's motion to correct the sentence. In considering the state's appeal from the decision, the court first held that it had jurisdiction over the appeal because the issue of the circuit court's jurisdiction was involved. The enactment of Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect;&sect; 12-301, 12-302, did not alter the state's right to appeal from the circuit court's refusal to correct an illegal sentence. Turning to the gravamen of the appeal, the court found that Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 641A granted the circuit court the discretion to suspend the sentence imposed under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 413. The court found no indicia of legislative intent to exempt sentences imposed under &sect; 413 from the broad authority vested in court to suspend sentences.

While defendants claimed, as a former employer having a duty to a new employer, to have a conditional privilege in making the statements, the court held that if plaintiff could show malice on the part of defendants, the privilege would be overcome.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer had members of its security detail man a checkpoint to ensure that employees leaving the plant were not stealing the employer's goods. The employee was detained by security guards, but no goods were discovered upon the employee. The employee alleged that he was shoved and pushed into the office by the security guards. The court applied the Gertz holdings to the case. First, the court noted that the employee was not a public figure. Next, the court considered whether the matter involved the public or general interest and concluded that the defamation was purely private. Because the defamation was purely private it was not within the ambit of the First Amendment and Maryland law applied. The defamation complained of by the employee was through actions or conduct and the actions, if defamatory, were slander. Here, because the defamation was slander per se no proof of special damages was required. The court determined that the evidence was sufficient to find the existence of a qualified privilege, but the evidence was also sufficient for the jury to find that the privilege had been abused. As a result, the slander judgment was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the non-signer provision of Md. Ann. Code art. 83, &sect; 107 was unconstitutional under Md.

Even if, in proper circumstances, the court could have deemed a prior ruling of the appeals court as not controlling, the court was not persuaded that the challenged rule had become unsound. The courts of last resort that rejected fair trade acts on constitutional grounds seemed to have usually done so because of an unwillingness to accept the legislative judgment as to the economic facts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The security guard's arrest occurred after he finished his shift as a night watchman leaving with two bags full of grocery store items. The court affirmed the directed verdict holding that under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 551A(a), ownership or lawful possession of goods by the merchant was an element of the crime of shoplifting, it was not necessary for the merchant to prove ownership or lawful possession to establish probable cause to believe that a crime had been committed. Thus, the person making the arrest was not required to know that the goods are owned or lawfully possessed by the merchant, but only to have reason to believe that they are. The court found that the evidence was insufficient to support a conclusion that the goods taken by the security guard were abandoned but did support an inference that the goods taken from the store were mislaid property. Thus, the store had probable cause at the time the security guard was arrested that he removed the mislaid groceries from the store.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The distributor did not provide a 90-day notice prior to the expiration of the agreement.

Code Ann., Corps. &amp; Ass'ns art. &sect; 167E (8) (1973), sufficient notice was provided. The distributor also questioned whether &sect; 167E (8) could be enforced in the light of the Lanham Act. On appeal, the court determined that (1) the agreement automatically terminated at the end of its stated term and that the distributor was entitled to possession of the premises; (2) there was no conflict between the Maryland Gasoline Products Marketing Act and the Lanham Act; and (3) the marketing agreement had no renewal clause, therefore the requirement in &sect; 167E (8) to provide a 90-day notice of intent not to renew did not apply.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction rendered by the Circuit Court for Caroline County (Maryland) for unlawfully making use of telephone facilities for repeated calls, with intent to annoy, abuse, torment, harass or embarrass, in violation of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect;555A. Defendant argued that &sect; 555A was unconstitutionally vague and that the state failed to present sufficient evidence of his intent to annoy, torment, harass, or embarrass the victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that the victim received a call from an unidentified caller at her workplace. The caller, who was later identified as defendant, told her that he had admired her for a while, and that he wanted to meet with her. He told her about his family, his possessions, and gave his first name. Defendant then went to her workplace, smiled at her and left. He called back and told her that she could not say she had not met him before because she had just looked at him. After a bench trial, defendant was found guilty of violating &sect; 555A. The trial court, however, did not find evidence of defendant's intent to harass the victim, but ruled that it did not matter because the victim was upset by the calls. On appeal, the court reversed because the evidence failed to show that defendant made the calls with the specific intent to annoy or harass the victim. The court determined that it could not infer defendant's criminal intent solely based on the fact that he did not give the victim his last name. The court also concluded that by requiring specific intent, &sect; 555A sufficiently delineated the criminal conduct to be prohibited, therefore, it was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction without a new trial because there was insufficient evidence to support the element of intent. The court ordered that the costs be paid by the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision by the Criminal Court of Baltimore (Maryland), which convicted defendant of assault and battery. The trial court sentenced defendant to 10 years imprisonment, suspended the final 5 years of the sentence, and placed her on probation for a period of 5 years when she was released on parole. As a special condition of probation, the trial court ordered her to reimburse the State for counsels' fees of a public defender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State and defense counsel argued the judgment of conviction and sentence for the assault and battery. The court affirmed defendant's judgment of conviction of violating a city ordinance without further comment. Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction of assault and battery, that the trial court erred in not declaring a mistrial, and that the trial court erred in requiring her to pay court costs and to reimburse the State for the public defender's fees. The court held that the trial court's authority to require, as a special condition of probation, that defendant reimbursed the State for counsel fees incurred in her defense was superseded by the Maryland Public Defender law, Md. Ann. Code art. 27A. The court could have stricken out this condition of probation, which was beyond the trial court's authority to impose, and let the sentence stood. But it was obvious that the trial judge devised a plan that he considered best for defendant and for society. Eliminating one aspect of the plan could have defeated the desired result. The court noted that arguments about the insufficiency of the evidence and the motion for a mistrial had no merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction of violating the city ordinance. The court vacated the sentence for assault and battery and remanded the case for imposition of a proper sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland) that found him in contempt of court for his failure to comply with a court order directing that he undergo an examination at the Patuxent Institution to determine his status as a defective delinquent. Defendant was incarcerated after his conviction for manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that because the two elements that the doctor at the Institute was unable to ascertain were his intellectual deficiency and emotional unbalance, his refusal to cooperate could have been the result of those factors rather than a contemptuous refusal and, as such, that it was error to find him in contempt of court. He also argued that submitting to such an examination would violate his constitutional right against self-incrimination. The court affirmed the contempt order, concluding that there was nothing in the record tending to show that defendant's contemptuous conduct was the product of intellectual deficiency or emotional unbalance. The court noted that a person was presumed to be sane in the absence of evidence to the contrary. The court opined that a defendant's right not to incriminate himself was not violated per se by requiring him in an appropriate case to submit to an examination to determine defective delinquency. Therefore, the court concluded that the examination procedures at the Institute did not violate defendant's right against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city property owners sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland), dismissing their petition that sought injunctive and declaratory relief against appellee county and state. The taxpayers' complaint alleged that the county's imposition of an ad valorem property tax and use of a tax rate differential for city taxpayers was arbitrary and violated the uniformity requirement of Md. Const. art. 15.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the city property owners' petition against the county and state challenging a county ad valorem property tax that was imposed on all property owners within the county for services such as fire, police, recreation, and street maintenance. The city property owners claimed they paid both the county and city governments for the services, yet received the services only from the city government. A tax rate differential was allowed for city property owners, but they claimed the tax rate was arbitrary, that the tax was double taxation and violated the uniformity requirement of Md. Const. art. 15. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court judgment. The court held that the city property owners were taxed as county property owners in the same manner and according to the same rate (before any differential adjustment) as those county property owners living outside the city. The county imposed no additional tax on the city dwellers, thus no double taxation resulted. The court found that the assailed tax was general and ad valorem, thus its legality did not depend upon the receipt of any special benefit by the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that the trial court erred in dismissing the petition because the judgment should have reflected that summary judgment was granted in the city property owners' action challenging the county's imposition of an ad valorem tax for public services. The court modified that trial court judgment to reflect that summary judgment was granted to the county and state and affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee argued that Md. Code Ann. art. 101, &sect; 36(4a), which provided that any additional compensation for permanent partial disability on a petition to reopen could not increase the amount of compensation previously awarded and paid, was unconstitutional because it denied him equal protection of the laws. He claimed that had he waited until his condition worsened to file his original claim he would have received greater benefits and, as such, that &sect; 36(4a) discriminated against those employees that filed disability claims immediately after being injured and those that waited before filing their claim. The court affirmed the judgment, noting that a statute was presumed to be constitutional in the absence of a clear and convincing showing by the party alleging its unconstitutionality that it was arbitrary and did not rest on any reasonable basis. The court found that the employee failed to meet his burden because the record was devoid of evidence demonstrating a &quot;lack of a reasonable basis&quot; for the legislature's enactment of the portion of &sect; 36(4a) in dispute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town filed a bill of complaint for a declaratory decree in which it alleged that it was harmed by the county's failure to include the town's plan for sewage and water within the county's 10-year comprehensive sewage and water plan. The county raised a preliminary objection to the bill by motion. The trial granted the county's motion and dismissed the town's bill. The town then filed an amended bill, which essentially sought the same relief and added the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene as a party. The Department, in a motion raising a preliminary objection, argued that the trial court was without jurisdiction because the town had failed to exhaust its remedies. The trial court agreed and dismissed the town's amended bill. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the town was required to comply with Md. Ann. Code art. 41, &sect; 206B et seq. and exhaust its remedies before it could seek judicial review. The court held that ordinarily whenever an administrative agency had the authority to dispose of an issue by determining it in favor of the party seeking review, there had to be an exhaustion of administrative remedies before recourse to the courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal and ordered the town to pay costs.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that the trial judge had not erred in denying his motion for a new trial, even though the foreman of the jury dozed for a moment, because defendant had in no way shown how he was prejudiced by the foreman's momentary inattention. Finally, the court found that the trial court had properly directed the jury to return to deliberate immediately upon learning that they had failed to consider one of the counts in the indictment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of misappropriating monies received at real estate closings, and of concealing the presence of encumbrances upon title. The court affirmed the trial court's conviction of defendant as to the fraudulent misappropriation counts and reversed as to four false pretenses charges, because the charges fatally omitted the essential element of intent to defraud. The court held that defendant was a fiduciary within the contemplation of &sect; 132 because the purchasers relied upon defendant to serve as their attorney at the property settlements, and reposed trust and confidence in him to represent their interests. Whether defendant personally profited from his wrongdoing was irrelevant. The conviction was affirmed on the properly charged count of false pretenses, because there was no requirement that the victim be able to place a monetary figure on its loss. Finally, the fact that a search warrant affidavit was primarily supported by hearsay did not invalidate the warrant where the informants were victims or disinterested witnesses of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor of Virginia issued an extradition order to receive the accused, described as a fugitive from justice, from the proper authorities of Maryland.

The Governor of Maryland issued a warrant of rendition authorizing an agent and a guard to take and transport the accused to the state line of Maryland. The court held that the accused did not have a constitutional right to trial by jury in a habeas corpus proceeding. The issuance of a warrant of rendition created a presumption that the accused was the fugitive wanted. The accused had the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt either that he was not present in the demanding state at the time of the crime or that he was not the person named in the warrant. The accused did not maintain that he was not in the demanding state at the time that an alleged offense was committed.

Court found that defendant's self-serving declarations that he fully intended repay the money did not negate the intent to defraud element of the crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For defendants to have been validly convicted of the charges against them, the State had to produce evidence sufficient in law to show that the principals, who defendants aided and abetted, committed an act prohibited and made a misdemeanor by Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 240 and that defendants aided or abetted therein. The court found that the evidence adduced by way of the statement of facts was legally sufficient, directly or by rational inference, for the trial court to find that the principals were making a book on the results of running races of horses on the dates charged with one exception. As to that exception, the statement of facts given by the State omitted mention of a telephone conversation; therefore, there was no evidence regarding that charge. As to defendants' claims regarding freedom of speech, the court found no authority holding that speech which aided or abetted the commission of a crime was within the protection of the constitutional guarantees. Because defendants' claim that Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 240 was unconstitutionally vague was not raised in the trial court, it was not properly before the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments except that it reversed the one charge against one of the defendants, upon which there was insufficient evidence, and remanded the case for a new trial on that charge alone.</SPAN></P>

Ann. Code art. 101, &sect; 91(b), (c) of $ 150 plus 15 percent of a certain worker's compensation award for which the employer was uninsured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee's widow filed a dependant's claim with the Commission based upon the death of her husband during the course of his employment. Because the employer was uninsured at the time of the accident giving rise to the claim, the Fund was a party to the proceedings. The Commission ordered that the employer pay certain compensation benefits to the widow and pay the employee's medical bills and funeral expenses. The Commission further assessed the employer, as a non-insurer, the sum of $ 150 plus 15 percent of the award, not to exceed $ 1500. Because there had never been any default in the payments by the employer as required under the award, the superior court reversed the Commission's assessment. On appeal, the court vacated, holding that, while the superior court may have seasoned justice with mercy, its holding was wrong. The command of Md. Ann. Code art. 101, &sect; 91(b) to assess employers was not tempered or limited by the prescriptions of other code sections. Even though the employer timely paid the award, it was still subject to an assessment for its failure to secure compensation in accordance with the statutory requirements.</SPAN></P>

The court analyzed the provisions of &sect; 534H and held that they were fashioned to provide a day for recreation, repose, and enjoyment, not religion. The court reviewed First Amendment case law and distinguished legislation that challenged under the Establishment Clause from the Free Exercise Clause. The court held that recent case law had not modified McGowan, which held that the Maryland Sunday Closing Laws were not laws that respected the improper establishment of religion. The stores had not asserted how, if it all, &sect; 543H interfered with or restricted their free exercise of religious conviction of lack of conviction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed suit against appellee State, seeking the expunction of six burglary convictions that were obtained prior to his 18th birthday. Appellant sought review of a decision by the Circuit Court of Baltimore City (Maryland), which granted the State's motion raising a preliminary objection that asserted immunity from the suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before appellant filed his suit for declaratory and injunctive relief, federal courts had determined that laws that established 16, rather than 18, as the maximum age for juvenile jurisdiction in Baltimore City were unconstitutional. State courts subsequently found that there was a cut-off date for retroactive application of the federal law. However, a federal court found that retroactive relief was available. Appellant disputed the contemporary propriety of sovereign immunity, the granting of the State's demurrer, and the denial of expungement. The court held that the State's motion raising preliminary objection was properly granted under the doctrine of sovereign immunity and that the demurrer was properly granted because appellant was not entitled to a declaration due to the cut-off date for retroactive relief, which was prior to appellant's convictions. The purpose behind the pertinent case law regarding the jurisdictional age of majority did not mandate retroactivity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The survivors brought a wrongful death action against the physician and the hospital after their decedent died as a result of alleged malpractice. On the date of her death, the statute of limitations for wrongful death actions was two years. The survivors brought their action after the original statute had run, but the legislature had increased the limitations period to three years before the two year statute would have run on their case. The trial court granted summary judgment to the physician under a prior case holding the extension unconstitutional, and the survivors sought review. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that the statute contained an ambiguity because literal application of its text would render it unconstitutional. In construing the statute, the court interpreted it to permit retroactive application of the extended limitations period to cases, such as the survivors', where the limitations period had not run at the time of the amendment. The court therefore held that the amended statute could be applied retroactively to the survivors' case in order to give effect to the legislative intent.</SPAN></P>

The court held that while the board could have made more express findings, its finding that the owners' junkyard operation was conducted primarily on open land and did not utilize a permanent building or structure at the time of the enactment of the zoning ordinance was implicit in the determination that it did not qualify as an exception to the requirement of termination and was, therefore, in violation of the ordinance. The pertinent provision of the ordinance was not unduly oppressive on the owners because they failed to show that it was unreasonable or invalid in its application to them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being raped, the victim provided detailed testimony concerning the rape and positively identified defendants, the car, and its license tag number. A jury convicted defendants of rape, perverted practices, and assault, and sentenced them to imprisonment for life, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the warrantless search of defendant's automobile did violate his rights under U.S. Const. amend.

However, the admission of the evidence seized as a result of the improper search was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because of the details of the crime provided by the victim. The trial court properly refused to allow the victim to be questioned on her reputation for chastity because the defense was alibi, not consent. The jury instructions on sentencing were proper and unambiguous, and the trial court gave an instruction on identification that was substantially the same, although not in the same form, as the charge requested by defendants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Md. Ann. Code art. 101, &sect; 64A, appellant fire fighter claimed workmen's compensation benefits from appellee board of county commissioners (county), as an employer and a self-insurer. The Maryland Workmen's Compensation Commission processed the claim as for an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of his employment and rejected it. The Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland) affirmed. The fire fighter sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fire fighter sought to recover workmen's compensation benefits for occupational disease, pursuant to &sect; 64A. The circuit court affirmed the Commission's denial of the fire fighter's claim, finding that &sect; 64A violated Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 29. The fire fighter appealed. The court held that Md. Ann. Code art. 101, &sect; 64A, which provided a presumption of compensable occupational disease in cases of certain fire fighters sustaining temporary or total disability or death under certain conditions, did not violate Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 29, which essentially provided that every law enacted by the Maryland General Assembly shall embrace but one subject described in its title. The main purpose of Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 29 was to prevent enactment under a misconception by reason of a misdescriptive title. Here, there was no repugnancy between the title and the body of Md. Ann. Code art. 101, &sect; 64A. Therefore, the court held that the legislative purpose in the passage of &sect; 64A was to amend the workmen's compensation law in the field of occupational diseases and was not violative of Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 29. Moreover, Md. Ann. Code art. 101, &sect; 64A did not violate the federal Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The great weight of authority maintained that the failure to minimize required only the suppression of those conversations which should not have been seized and not the suppression of those conversations which were appropriately seized. Where, in the execution of a valid search warrant, material beyond the scope of the warrant was illegally seized, the material validly seized was not tainted and was properly admissible.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of burglary and sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that: (1) defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court's refusal to exclude the witnesses until the completion of the opening statements because the State's witnesses could not have been taught, schooled, or prompted in any meaningful sense by hearing one another's testimony as outlined in the State's opening statement; (2) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the State to amend the indictment as the error in the indictment was typographical and the amendment was as to form and not substance; (3) defendant's claim that there were no facts to indicate that placement of an item bearing his fingerprints could not have been at a time other than the date of the incident was without merit as the jury was not required to accept defendant's explanation as to the fingerprints; and (4) defendant was not denied due process by the sentence imposed because the trial judge's appraisal of defendant's attitude, including the evidence of his veracity at trial, was highly relevant to the exercise of the trial judge's sentencing discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland), which convicted him as an adult of robbery with a deadly weapon and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence and held that defendant waived his right to a waiver hearing pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 594A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, was convicted of robbery with a deadly weapon and appealed. On appeal, the court remanded to the trial court for a waiver hearing without either affirming or reversing the judgment. The court ruled that the trial court erred in concluding that defendant waived his right to a hearing pursuant to &sect; 594A. The court found that Md. Ann. Code art. 26, &sect; 70-2 (d)(3) exempted from juvenile court jurisdiction, absent a waiver, cases alleging robbery of the aggravated sort. The court determined that art. 27, &sect; 594A did not specifically provide for a waiver hearing nor enumerate factors to be considered by the court in determining if waiver was indicated. On remand, the trial court was ordered to hold a waiver hearing to determine, nunc pro tunc, whether a waiver to the juvenile court was in the interests of the child and society. If the trial court determined that waiver to the juvenile court was not warranted, then the judgment of conviction would stand, since there was no appeal on the merits. However, if a waiver was called for then the judgment would have been a nullity and the trial court would be required to order the case to be transferred to the juvenile court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded to the trial court for a waiver hearing but neither affirmed nor reversed the judgment convicting defendant of robbery with a deadly weapon and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury and appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it joined defendant's claims because defendant was not prejudiced in the joint trial of all the charges against him. Furthermore, all of the offenses charged were of the same general nature, formed part of a general scheme of unlawful conduct, and permitted the same mode of trial. The refusal to order separate trials or an election by the state was neither an abuse of discretion nor a denial of defendant's constitutional rights. The court concluded that the proffered testimony of other sheriffs' practices, as they related to prisoners under commitment awaiting trial, was not relevant to the issue of a prisoner held after conviction. The court held that it was unclear what portions of the record defendant claimed constituted a violation of his right against self-incrimination, but it was clear that such right did not apply to evidence which defendant introduced. Moreover, defendant was not prejudiced if the jury instructions were a correct statement of the law. Finally, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

The court held: (1) a plea of recrimination was not a bar to either party obtaining a divorce on the ground of statutory separation; (2) reconciliation was not in and of itself a defense to a divorce, nor could a refusal of such an offer be in and of itself a defense to, or ground of, divorce; (3) the statutory separation ground used by the husband precluded use of culpability and recrimination as a defense; and (4) offers of reconciliation were not to be considered with respect to an award of alimony to an a vinculo divorce granted on the grounds of voluntary or statutory separation, and the trial court had the power to reserve an award of alimony.</SPAN></P>

The Maryland officer arrested defendant when he arrived at the airport and picked up his suitcases. The suitcases were seized and a search revealed the remaining marihuana. The circuit court denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence and a jury convicted him of possession of marihuana with intent to distribute. On appeal, the court affirmed. Probable cause existed for the Maryland officer to seize and search the suitcases because he received direct information from the Tucson officer that the luggage contained drugs. The Tucson officer had probable cause to search the luggage because he smelled marihuana. The warrantless searches of the suitcases by the Tucson and Maryland officers were proper because there was probable cause to believe that the luggage contained contraband, and there were exigent circumstances arising from the mobility of the suitcases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county executive reorganized the office of planning and zoning, reducing the number of employees in the office. The taxpayers brought an action against the county executive alleging that the reorganization was illegal under the Baltimore County Charter that vested the power of reorganization exclusively in the County Council. The trial court sustained the county executive's demurrer to the complaint and held that the taxpayers did not have standing to bring the suit. The court affirmed. The court held that taxpayers had standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute when the statute as applied increased their taxes, but if they could not show a pecuniary loss or that the statute resulted in increased taxes to them, they had no standing to make such a challenge. To meet this test, the taxpayers argued that the office of planning and zoning would be less efficient; therefore, inefficiency would impair the county's tax base and would increase concomitantly the real estate taxes of the taxpayers. The court found that the taxpayers' allegations were too tenuous to give them standing. The appellants alleged no facts that led to the conclusion that taxes would be increased.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the wife filed motions to enforce the divorce decree. The husband filed motions to modify or terminate alimony and visitation rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband challenged the constitutionality of Md. Ann. Code art. 16, &sect; 5(a). The court declined to address the merits of the issue because the issue presented did not affect any rights of the father. The court determined that the award of alimony to the wife pursuant to the decree of divorce a mensa survived the subsequent Florida divorce decree granting the husband a divorce a vinculo. Therefore, the trial court properly ordered sequestration and attachment of the husband's property within its jurisdiction to enforce payment of alimony. Furthermore, the court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in modifying the alimony payment. The wife contended that the trial court erred in modifying her visitation rights in disregard of a stipulation by the parties. However, the court found no stipulation in the record.

The two passengers proceeded to rob the store owner and his wife, killing the owner and wounding his wife. The passengers gave defendant $ 16 of the $ 125 they took from the store. The jury acquitted defendant of murder, attempted murder, and armed robbery, and initially returned a verdict of guilty the unlawful receipt of the stolen money, unauthorized use of an automobile, and larceny of an automobile. Defense counsel brought the trial court's attention to the fact that he believed the verdicts to be inconsistent due to the convictions for both unauthorized use and larceny. The jury was sent back to deliberate and returned a verdict of guilty on the larceny charge. On appeal, defendant challenged the procedure by which the jury verdict was rendered. The court noted initially that defendant did not object to the recall of the jury or any of the subsequent proceedings. The court, in affirming the trial court's judgment, found that unauthorized use of an automobile was a lesser included offense of larceny and that therefore, the unauthorized use conviction merged into the greater offense.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court vacated, voided the appointment of the institution, and remanded to the orphans' court to conduct a proceeding in judicial probate and appoint a personal representative of the estate. The court found that the orphans' court had neither power nor discretion to appoint the institution personal representative of the estate because the institution, as a corporation chartered under and subject to the provisions of Md. Ann. Code art. 23, could not be granted letters in administrative or judicial probate nor be appointed a successor personal representative or special administrator, and had no power or authority to act in such capacity. The court also found that such a corporation was not a &quot;person&quot; eligible for letters in probate within the contemplation of Md. Ann. Code art. 93, &sect; 5-104.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant parents appealed from orders from the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Division for Juvenile Causes (Maryland), which ordered them to pay restitution for the acts of their minor children and struck their appeal of that order as untimely. A juvenile master, whose decision was affirmed by the juvenile court, had adjudicated the children as delinquent. Restitution by the parents was sought pursuant to Md. Code Ann. art. 26, &sect; 71A (1957).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children were adjudicated delinquent after beating up another child. The children's parents were ordered to pay restitution to the victim pursuant to art. 26, &sect; 71A, as implemented by Md. Code Ann. art. 26, &sect; 70-22 (1957) and former Md. R. 922. The parents' appeal, encompassing all judgments and orders, was filed more than 30 days from the orders for probation against the children, but within 30 days from the orders of restitution. The parents appealed from the trial court's sua sponte decision striking the appeal as untimely. On appeal, the court affirmed that part of the trial court's order that struck the appeal of the delinquency proceedings because they were not timely filed. With regard to the restitution order, the court reversed because the trial court's conclusion that restitution flowed inevitably from the delinquency determination was in error. The court held that a trial court could not order restitution by a delinquent child's parents except after a hearing in which there was legally sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that damages authorized by the statute were wilfully or maliciously caused by or committed by a child under eighteen years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgments that required the parents to pay restitution and remanded the cause for further proceedings to determine whether the children's' acts were willful or malicious. The court affirmed the trial court's decision to strike the parents' appeal of the adjudication of delinquency.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized from a farm at which defendant resided.

Defendant alleged that the affidavit for the search warrant was based on information obtained by an unconstitutional search and seizure. Defendant also challenged the sufficiency of the evidence on both convictions. The court affirmed defendant's convictions, finding that the exclusionary rule did not apply and that the magistrate could consider the illegally seized evidence in determining probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant. The court concluded that the purpose of the exclusionary rule was one of deterrence and that the information obtained by an illegal search was trustworthy.

The case came to trial before a jury in the trial court. On conclusion of the State's case, the trial court sua sponte declared a mistrial. Defendant moved that the warrant and all charges arising thereunder should be dismissed for the reason that any subsequent trial would put her twice in jeopardy. The motion was denied prior to a retrial upon a hearing. She appealed. The court held that it was clear from the reasons given by the hearing judge that he recognized her constitutional right, but on the facts and circumstances found that it was not applicable. Thus, the determination by the trial court to deny the motion to dismiss was an exercise of judicial discretion as to the functioning of her right. As such, it was interlocutory, and appeal therefrom was premature. Appeals from interlocutory orders of the trial court in criminal cases were not allowed. If the State retried defendant and she was convicted, the court would then determine the double jeopardy issue if presented on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from an incident when a gunman hiding in the locked trunk of a car killed a police officer. Defendant, who was driving the car, was stopped as a suspect in a robbery. He and the car were taken to police station. When defendant heard that the officer had been shot during an attempted search of the trunk, he exclaimed that had he known the gunman would shoot anybody, he would have opened the trunk for the police. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. Precedent had already found the jury pool constitutional. The trial court's admonition to the jury to disregard prosecutorial questions and comments regarding defendant's failure to advise police that the gunman was hidden in the trunk cured any possible Miranda violation for commenting on defendant's silence. The comments should have been allowed because defendant waived his Miranda rights and then attempted to mislead the police by his statements regarding the gunman's whereabouts. There was sufficient evidence to support both crimes. The trial court's jury instructions regarding homicide, the reasonable doubt standard, the presumption of innocence, and other advisory instructions were proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two related cases, the State appealed the decision of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland), which granted defendants' motions to suppress evidence and dismissed the indictments against them. Defendants were indicted for violations of the Maryland controlled dangerous substances law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the two defendants was arrested in an airport after police officers received a tip from police officers in Houston, Texas, that defendant was carrying marijuana in his luggage. Defendant met the description provided to Maryland police exactly. Defendant was met at the airport by the second defendant. Defendants were detained and arrested. After the arrest, the officers searched the first defendant's luggage and discovered marijuana. Defendants were indicted for controlled substances violations. The trial court granted defendants' motions to suppress the evidence found in the luggage on the ground that the evidence had been found as the result of an illegal search and seizure. The trial court dismissed the indictments against defendants. On appeal, the court initially noted that although the State could not appeal the grant of a motion to suppress evidence, the order of dismissal was a final and appealable order giving the court jurisdiction over the matter. The court also found that there was probable cause for defendants' warrantless arrests. As a result, the subsequent search of the luggage was a legal search incident to lawful arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, denied defendants' motions to dismiss the State's appeals, reversed the trial court's judgment granting the motions to suppress evidence, and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the use of electronic devices by the police officer in defendant's case did not violate the Fourth Amendment guarantee against unreasonable search and seizures. The court further held that the use of electronic devices did not violate 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2510-2520 because the use fell within the exemption provided for in 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2511(2)(c), which permitted use of the devices where one of the parties to the communication gave prior consent. Additionally, the court found that use of the devices did not violate Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 125(A) because it was done under the authority of a court order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court was without jurisdiction to try his case because the offense occurred in the State of Delaware and that the trial court violated his constitutional rights when it considered his prior record without a showing that he had been represented by or waived counsel at the prior proceedings.

However, the court reversed as to defendant's sentence because the trial court considered both defendant's juvenile delinquency record, as well as his adult criminal record, for the purpose of enhancing punishment without the required showing that the prior convictions and the prior findings of delinquency were constitutionally valid. The court remanded for resentencing and ordered that the trial not rely upon or use any conviction demonstrated to have been obtained in violation of defendant's right to counsel for the purpose of enhancing punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Cecil County (Maryland), which denied his motion to dismiss an indictment against him for violation of the Maryland Controlled Dangerous Substance Law, Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 279. The motion to dismiss was predicated on an allegation that the indictment was based on evidence seized by illegal wire taps. The trial court also denied defendant a full hearing to suppress the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two detectives submitted an affidavit seeking an ex parte wiretap order after receiving information from a number of confidential informants that defendant was a distributor of controlled dangerous substances. The hearing judge signed the order authorizing the wiretap; the order was subsequently extended once. Upon being indicted, defendant filed motions to suppress all evidence on the ground that it was obtained as the result of an unlawful search based on information from illegal wiretaps. After defendant's arrest, the State mailed a letter to defendant indicating that it would not use any of the information collected via the wiretaps against him. The trial court denied all defendant's motions but did restrict the State's ability to use evidence collected as a result of the wiretaps due to the State's failure to notify defendant of the existence of the wiretap as required by 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2518(3)(d). On appeal, the court held that there was an independent basis for the information collected from the wiretaps. The court also found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to hold a hearing on the issue or in denying defendant access to the tapes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was one of four persons arrested and jointly indicted after they were stopped late at night near a location of a shooting, and a bag of marihuana was found in the car under defendant's feet. Of the three defendants who went to trial, two obtained acquittals at the close of the State's case as to all or most of the charges. After defendant was convicted, he appealed. The court affirmed. It rejected defendant's claims that his guilt was prejudged, that he was denied equal protection, and that he should have been acquitted. The court also rejected defendant's claim that the physical evidence should have been suppressed as the product of an unconstitutional search and seizure. In so ruling, the court found that the initial stop of the car was valid under Terry because the officer had a reasonable suspicion that it was connected with criminal activity. The search that revealed the contraband was also valid because the officer was entitled to take steps to assure himself that defendant was not armed. Because the bag was in defendant's immediate vicinity, its search was proper and the fortuitous discovery of contraband did not violate defendant's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
