</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The former county executive appointed a deputy county executive, and 10 days later the former county executive resigned. The deputy county executive then became the county executive pursuant to &sect; C3-10. Plaintiffs filed an action against the county executive and the county legislature. Plaintiffs sought to enjoin the county executive from acting as such, and sought a special election under N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect; 42, 43. The trial court held that Suffolk County Charter &sect; C3-10 was unconstitutional and that the county executive had no authority to continue to act in that capacity. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and found that the trial court did not refer to any passage from the state or federal constitutions that was inconsistent with &sect; C3-10. The court held that there was no rule of constitutional law that mandated that all vacancies of elective offices had to be filled at an election held as soon after the occurrence of the vacancy as reasonably possible. The court concluded that N.Y. County Law &sect; 400(7) and N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect;&sect; 42, 43, were inapplicable and that Suffolk County Charter &sect; C3-10 complied with the state bill of rights for local governments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Counties -- Succession in Office of County Executive in Event of Vacancy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suffolk County Charter &sect; C3-10, which provides that in the event of a vacancy in the office of County Executive prior to the expiration of the incumbent's term of office, the Deputy County Executive designated by the incumbent shall become Acting County Executive until the vacancy is filled at a special election called by the Suffolk County Legislature or, if none is called, at the first general election after the occurrence of the vacancy is constitutional.  Accordingly, since respondent was duly appointed as a Deputy County Executive by the incumbent and was designated by the latter to perform his duties in the event of his temporary disability or absence, by operation of section C3-10 respondent became the Acting County Executive upon the resignation of the incumbent. There is no rule of constitutional law which mandates that vacancies in all elective offices must be filled at an election held as soon&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  after the occurrence of the vacancy as reasonably possible; NY Constitution, article XIII, &sect; 3 authorizes the filling of vacancies in a public office by way of appointment, subject only to the limitation that the person so appointed may hold office for no longer than the commencement of the political year following the first annual election held after the occurrence of the vacancy, and the subject provision of the charter is in complete harmony with this section.  County Law &sect; 400 (7), which provides that, with certain exceptions, a vacancy in an elective county office shall be filled by the Governor by appointment, is inapplicable since the County Law has no application to the extent that it conflicts with the provision of the Suffolk County Charter ( County Law &sect; 2 [b]).  Public Officers Law &sect; 42 (3), which provides that the Governor may proclaim a special election upon the occurrence of a vacancy in an elective office which cannot be filled by appointment for a period extending to or beyond the next general election is inapplicable since the office of County Executive was filled by an appointment to a term extending at least until the general election of 1987; similarly, Public&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officers Law &sect; 43, limited to cases in which vacancies occur with no provision of law for filling same, has no application here.  The method of succession provided in section C3-10 is in full accordance with the bill of rights for local governments contained in N Y Constitution, article IX, &sect; 1 and with the powers conferred upon local governments by the Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 10.  </SPAN></P>

The ticketed speeder then sought review of the ALJ's determination. The trial court converted the proceeding to an action for declaratory judgment and found that &sect; 123.1 was unconstitutional as applied to the ticketed speeder. The court reversed that judgment, holding that the trial court erred in rewriting the regulations to suit the facts of the ticketed speeder's case because there was no constitutional infirmity in the substitution in the adjudication of traffic infractions of an administrative agency and administrative procedures for courts of criminal jurisdiction and judicial procedures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed an order of the Supreme Court, Kings County (New York) that granted defendant's motion pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 330.30(1) to set aside a jury verdict finding him guilty of kidnapping in the first degree and dismissed that count of the indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged in an indictment with murder in the second degree, sodomy in the first degree, and kidnapping in the first degree. The trial court dismissed the two murder counts. At the conclusion of the State's case, defendant filed a motion for a trial order of dismissal of the kidnapping count. The trial court granted the motion and found that as a matter of law the prosecution had not proved its case for kidnapping. The prosecutor filed a motion to reargue the trial court's order, asserting that the trial court should reserve decision until the verdict was rendered and accepted by the trial court. It also argued that the trial court's order was not a trial order of dismissal but an order dismissing the kidnapping count on the ground that the State did not prove defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and that the order was a nullity. On appeal, the court found that double jeopardy principles barred appeal unless there was available a determination of guilt, which without more may be reinstated in the event of a reversal and remand. The court dismissed the appeal and declared the jury's guilty verdict a nullity. The court reinstated the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>

Law &sect; 396(r) and enjoined them from selling or offering to sell any consumer goods for an unconscionably excessive price during any abnormal disruption of the market, ordered them to make restitution, and assessed a civil penalty against them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sellers increased prices on electric generators during a time when many people had lost power due to a hurricane. In an action brought by the state the sellers were found to have violated the prohibition on price-gouging found in &sect; 396(r). The trial court enjoined the sellers from selling or offering to sell any consumer goods for an unconscionably excessive price during any abnormal disruption of the market, ordered them to make restitution, and assessed a civil penalty against them. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. First, the generators were within the ambit of &sect; 396(r) because they were bought for household purposes. Moreover, &sect; 396(r) specifically prohibited merchants from taking unfair advantage of consumers during a disruption in the market caused by a power failure. Second, increases in freight and labor expenses were not taken into account by &sect; 396(r)(3) because they were not costs imposed by the sellers' suppliers. Third, the sellers' prices were unconscionably excessive. Finally, &sect; 396(r) was not unconstitutionally vague because its standards were sufficient to apprise the sellers that their prices increases of 67 percent constituted price-gouging.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the city's motion requesting that any reimbursement of tax revenues be effected through a tax credit to be applied against taxes levied for the next year. The city reimbursed the taxes collected under &sect; 1262-b by issuing tax credits for those amounts, which could be applied to current tax bills. The taxpayers, in an action to compel the city to comply with the trial court's order and issue cash refunds, filed a motion for summary judgment, and the city filed a cross-motion to dismiss the complaint. The trial court granted the summary judgment motion and denied the motion to dismiss.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed judgment from trial court convicting defendant of promoting prison contraband in the first degree.

Defendant's argument that the conviction was invalid since the Commissioner of Correctional Services failed to properly file the &quot;Standards of Inmate Behavior&quot; rulebook with the Secretary of State as required by N.Y. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8 had no merit. Neither did his argument that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 205.00(3) is unconstitutionally vague. The legislature's definition of &quot;contraband&quot; under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 205.00 did not constitute an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. The court found defendant was offered an opportunity to appear before a grand jury but refused to sign a waiver, thereby losing any right to testify. Thus, his statutory right to appear and testify was not denied. Defendant's pro se arguments were without merit because he failed to demonstrate good cause for his request to have assigned counsel replaced and venue changed.

The buyer relied on the lower court's holding that the town had properly spot zoned the property, applied for building permits that were granted, and built an asphalt plant. During the building of the plant, the neighbors in the underlying case appealed and the decision was reversed to find that the town had illegally spot zoned the buyer's property. The court reversed the finding that the prior decision was not applicable retroactively and held that there was no sound public policy argument for not giving retroactive application to a decision of the highest court of New York State. The court noted that the non-retroactivity principles were not fairly invoked by parties, such as the buyer and the town, which were parties within the litigation leading to the reversing decision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After determinations of a town board and town planning board authorized adoption of resolutions permitting the manufacture of asphalt on a particular parcel located within a light industrial district, plaintiff purchased that portion of the property which was the subject of the zoning resolutions in reliance upon the Appellate Division's affirmance of Special Term's dismissal of a proceeding to annul the determinations, and obtained a building permit for the construction of an asphalt plant although aware that an appeal was pending in the Court of Appeals, following which plaintiff virtually completed construction of the plant before the Court of Appeals reversed the order of the Appellate Division and granted the petition.

Plaintiff retired Mount Vernon city judge sought a retroactive salary increase and a pension base adjustment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Unified Court Budget Act, N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 221-i (1985), maintained a salary disparity between the retired Mt. Vernon city judge and the judges of the nearby cities of White Plains and Yonkers. The retired judge claimed that the Act violated his equal protection rights and sought a retroactive salary increase and a pension base adjustment. In declaring the Act unconstitutional, the supreme court found that the statutorily mandated disparate treatment violated the retired judge's equal protection rights. On appeal, the court affirmed by finding that no rational basis existed for the Act's geographic salary classifications. Statistical information demonstrated the similarities in the functions, duties, and responsibilities of the judges of the three city courts, which were all located in the same county, were virtually contiguous, and had substantially the same caseloads. There was a true unity of judicial interest indistinguishable by separate geographic considerations among the three city courts. The retired judge was entitled to the differential between his salary and that of the Yonkers city judges in calculating his retroactive salary increase and pension base adjustment.</SPAN></P>

Section 1277 required each county serviced by the authority to reimburse the authority for the costs incurred for the operation, maintenance and use of passenger trains within the particular county. Section 1277 also empowered the authority to recover unpaid station costs by reducing state assistance to the county by an equivalent amount from allocated state aid. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court did find that the county had standing to bring its lawsuit because it had a claimed interest in the withheld money. However, the court found that the county failed to sustained its burden in proving that &sect; 1277 was unconstitutional. The county's argument that &sect; 1277 violated the mandate of N.Y. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The devisees asserted that Florida was the decedent's domiciliary. The executor asserted that the decedent was domiciled in New York at the time of her death. The court found it undisputed that the decedent had homes in both Florida and New York. The court reversed the decree against the executor and granted the executor's petition to probate the decedent's will finding that the decedent in fact was domiciled in New York at the time of death. The court found that mitigating factors such as the fact that Florida law prohibited an out-of-state executor to serve, that the will was executed in New York, that the will stated that the decedent was a resident of New York and that the will was governed by New York law, as well as the fact that 10 out of 11 of the beneficiaries under the will resided in New York, all weighed toward probating the will in New York.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The will of decedent, who died in Florida with residences and other assets in both Florida and New York, should have been admitted to original probate in New York.  Surrogate's Court erred in summarily deciding that decedent was a Florida domiciliary since respondents failed to produce clear and convincing evidence that decedent intended to change her domicile from New York to Florida; although decedent had acquired a Florida driver's license, she also maintained her New York license, the facts that decedent registered to vote in Florida and filed tax returns as a Florida resident are not controlling, decedent had a concentration of financial operations, bank accounts and business dealings in New York, she declared in her will that she was a New York resident and she chose a burial site near her home in New York.  Assuming that decedent was a Florida domiciliary at&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the time of her death, the will should be admitted to probate in New York because decedent had real estate in New York, her estate includes significant intangible assets in New York, the will was executed in New York in accordance with New York law with the assistance of a New York attorney and was witnessed by New York residents, there are statements in the will that decedent was a New York resident and that her residuary legatees should be determined in accordance with New York law, 10 out of 11 beneficiaries under the will reside in New York, and the beneficiaries who together receive the clear majority of the estate seek probate in New York.  Further, Florida law prohibits petitioner, decedent's New York attorney who was named as executor, from serving as executor. </SPAN></P>

The Treasurer published notice for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation naming the properties for which the taxes were delinquent and which were subject to tax liens and sale.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provisions of the Nassau County Administrative Code (NCAC) dealing with the enforcement of collection of real estate taxes are not unconstitutional on the ground that the NCAC does not require that actual notice of sale of the tax lien upon the owner's property be served upon the property owner. The NCAC requires that the property owner be served with actual notice, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of his right to redeem the outstanding tax lien prior to the expiration of the redemption period, after which time the lienholder is entitled to acquire absolute title to the subject premises, and this statutory scheme is constitutional.  There is no constitutional requirement&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the owner receive personal notice of a tax sale, notification by publication being adequate.  The only practical effect of the tax lien sale is to change the entity to which the unpaid taxes are owed, since the tax lien purchaser does not obtain title to the premises on the date of the sale but merely acquires a tax lien and does not become entitled to exercise any possessory interest in the premises until the end of the statutory two-year redemption period.  Due process does not require that a property owner be afforded a hearing before the divestiture of his property title to enforce the collection of real estate taxes.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A CPLR article 78 proceeding is appropriate to challenge an interlocutory order of respondent Commissioner of Health which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  reversed a ruling of the Administrative Law Officer appointed to a panel hearing professional misconduct charges against petitioner, a licensed medical practitioner, that directed the complaining witnesses to present themselves for cross-examination and directed production of documentary evidence of any prior complaints by those witnesses against petitioner.  A license to practice medicine is a valuable property right which, although subject to regulation under the State's police power, may only be denied or withdrawn under procedures consonant with constitutional due process.  Forcing petitioner to pursue his administrative remedies without adequate discovery regarding the complaining witnesses could arguably undermine and impair the right of confrontation and cross-examination, and result in an unconstitutional deprivation of property without due process of law.  Accordingly, this proceeding is a legitimate exception to the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Physicians and Surgeons -- Disciplinary Proceedings -- Scope of Authority of Administrative Law Officer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Administrative Law Officer appointed to a panel hearing professional misconduct charges&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  against petitioner, a licensed medical practitioner, has exclusive and unfettered authority under Public Health Law &sect; 230 (10) (e) to make rulings on issues of law arising during the course of proceedings, and the statute does not reserve to respondent Commissioner of Health the right of review over such matters.  Accordingly, respondent Commissioner's reversal of rulings by the Administrative Law Officer, which directed the complaining witnesses to present themselves for cross-examination and directed production of documentary evidence of any prior complaints by those witnesses against petitioner, amounted to exceeding the scope of respondent's statutory authority. Respondent's attempt to reverse the Administrative Officer's ruling was an effort to redefine the parameters of the hearing, which was a usurpation of the functions specifically assigned to the Administrative Officer by the Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Physicians and Surgeons -- Disciplinary Proceedings -- Confidentiality of Reports of Medical Misconduct</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. At a hearing of charges of professional medical misconduct against petitioner psychiatrist, based upon acts of misconduct which allegedly took place 5 to 15 years prior&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the charges being preferred, petitioner is entitled to cross-examine the complaining witnesses and to discover any prior complaints filed against petitioner by those witnesses, within the context of Public Health Law &sect; 230 (11) (a), which provides confidentiality for any report of professional misconduct by a physician given to the State Board for Professional Medical Conduct.  Section 230 (11) (a) does not clearly indicate that the purpose of the confidentiality referred to is to protect the complaining source; the statute can also be read as ensuring that it is the target of the investigation who is, at this stage of the proceedings, entitled to the safeguarding of his reputation.  The purpose of the discovery sought by petitioner is not to disseminate any information regarding complainants, but rather to obtain information solely within the confines of the hearing.  Thus, to the limited extent that the complaining witnesses have appeared and testified in petitioner's presence at the proceeding, they have waived so much of the veil of confidentiality, within the context of the hearing, as concerns prior complaints about petitioner.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of conviction for criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree from the Supreme Court in Bronx County (New York), for which he was sentenced to an indeterminate term of 2 1/2 to 5 years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for possession of a weapon in the third degree. Defendant filed a motion to suppress a gun and certain statements he gave to a police officer, on the grounds that his right to freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, under the U.S. Const. amend. IV, had been violated. The motion to suppress was denied and a conviction resulted. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction, vacated the sentence, granted defendant's motion to suppress and dismissed the indictment. The court ruled that the search of defendant's vehicle was not an administrative search, designed to produce records that are regularly kept, such as vehicle identification numbers. The search was for the purpose of uncovering evidence of a crime; hence it fell under the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. The court noted that the police officer had no reason to believe a crime had been committed when the vehicle was searched. While the court recognized that vehicles are afforded less protection than other property under the Fourth Amendment, still the protections against unreasonable search and seizure applied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A judgment convicting defendant of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree is reversed, defendant's motion to suppress statements, a gun and vehicle identification number plate (VIN) is granted, and the indictment is dismissed.  The items were discovered by police during a warrantless search of a vehicle parked&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the driveway outside what appeared to be an automobile repair shop which had no identifying signs or registration numbers in front, after police observed three men, including defendant, working on the car, and inquired as to the ownership of the car.  The check of the vehicle and inspection for the VIN were made without any inquiry as to whether the establishment was licensed or why no registration numbers were displayed; it was a warrantless search for evidence of a crime and cannot be justified as an administrative search.  The gun seized was not in public view, and there was no justification for the level of intrusion. No violation of law attributable to defendant was observed prior to the search of the automobile; his production of documents and his statements that the car belonged to his wife established sufficient dominion and control to give him standing.  Finally, although defendant's statements made prior to and subsequent to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings were voluntary, they should be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree since all of the statements resulted from an initial police illegality.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers, an individual and a corporation, initiated a declaratory action against the Commission after the Commission issued warrants to the taxpayers for failure to pay sales and use taxes due.

After the Commission issued notices demanding payment of the taxes, the taxpayers failed to seek administrative review with respect to the warrants issued thereon. The trial court dismissed the taxpayers' action holding that it was premature because of the taxpayers' failure to exhaust their administrative remedies. In affirming that order, the court held that there was no constitutional impropriety where there had been no attempt to effect a seizure of property pursuant to the warrants and the taxpayers had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supervisor was appointed as police commissioner by the town board pursuant to N.Y. Town Law &sect; 150(2).

However, the supervisor, acting in his apparent authority as police commissioner, refused to effectuate the board's resolution. Petitioner sought to compel his appointment to sergeant and also claimed that the supervisor's appointment violated 1936 N.Y. Laws 526, which provided for the establishment, organization and operation of police departments in towns such as Stony Point, because ch. 526 did not authorized a town board to appoint a single individual to serve as the police commissioner, as was done here. The trial court held that ch. 526 was applicable, vacated the supervisor's appointment, and ordered a hearing as to the sergeant's position. The court affirmed. The supervisor's allegations that ch. 526 was unconstitutional were unsupported, a presumption of the legality of legislative acts applied, and ch. 526 had been properly published. Further, a hearing on the sergeant's position was required because there were questions of fact that could not be resolved on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. 78 to review a determination of respondents, state comptroller and administrator of the New York State Employees' Retirement System, which denied the retiree's request to have his retirement lag pay included in his final average salary for purposes of calculating retirement benefits under N.Y. Retire. and Soc. Sec. Law &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The retiree was a member of the New York State Employees' Retirement System. In 1982, the civil service employees association negotiated for salary increases. The retiree received an increase. In order to implement the salary increases, the state instituted a lag payroll for the first year. The result of the lag payroll was that the retiree did not receive pay for a brief work period. Payment for the period was to be paid to the retiree upon his retirement. Anticipating retirement, the retiree advised the System that he wished to have his lag payment included in the calculation of his final average salary. The System refused, stating that the subject payment had not been earned within the three-year period used to calculate his final average salary. The retiree filed a N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding and the court upheld the System's determination. The court held that because the lag pay was not earned within the previous three-year period, the application of N.Y. Retire. and Soc. Sec. Law &sect; 431 was not necessary. A plain reading of N.Y. Retire. and Soc. Sec. Law &sect; 2(2)(a) supported the System's interpretation that annual compensation consisted of income earned during the subject year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lag pay received by petitioner, a member of the New York State Employees Retirement System, upon his retirement, but earned more than three years earlier, should not be included in computing his final average salary. Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 2 (2) (a) defines annual compensation as &quot;[the] salary or wages annually earnable by a member, including maintenance, or any allowance in lieu thereof, received by the member&quot;, and section 2 (9) (b) provides that final average salary includes the &quot;highest average annual compensation earned during any three consecutive years of member service&quot;; the statutory language supports respondent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Comptroller's interpretation that annual compensation consists of income earned during the subject year. Although Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 431 prohibits including lump-sum payments for deferred compensation in any form of termination pay in the salary base for the computation of retirement benefits, and has been held unconstitutional as applied retroactively to employees who were members of the System prior to the effective date of the statute, respondent's determination did not indicate any reliance upon section 431.  Finally, including the lag pay of System members who retired within three years of the deferred pay period in their final average salary presents no injustice.  </SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court affirmed. It noted that &sect; 384-b(6)(e) specifically authorized the parent, as well as the petitioning agency, to submit other psychiatric, psychological or medical evidence relevant to the case. Moreover, the parent was free to cross-examine the court-appointed psychiatrist at the hearing. Therefore, rather than restricting the proof to the testimony of one witness, the statute set forth a minimum requirement of testimony by a psychiatric expert in order to terminate parental rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff gas and electric corporation appealed the decision of the Supreme Court at Special Term in Albany County (New York), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendant, the Public Service Commission (commission), in the corporation's declaratory judgment action regarding N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law &sect; 66d(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The legislature enacted N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law &sect; 66d(2), which required gas corporations to transport customer-owned gas and directed gas distribution corporations to file tariff leave amendments in accordance with the guidelines of the commission. The gas and electric corporation sought a declaratory judgment that &sect; 66d(2) violated its right to due process by converting it into a common carrier, by interfering with its facilities, and by establishing transportation rates that were not just and reasonable. The lower court granted the commission's motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. The corporation appealed. The court found that the law did convert the corporation to a common carrier of customer-owned natural gas by requiring the corporation when it had excess transportation capacity; however, that requirement did not violate the corporation's due process rights because it was not arbitrary or capricious. It merely extended the corporation's service to an area that it was already committed to serve. The court reversed the lower court's order and modified it by issuing a declaration in the commission's favor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision of the lower court, which had granted summary judgment in the commission's favor in the corporation's declaratory judgment action.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Utilities -- Transportation Services for Customer-Owned Gas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Although Public Service Law &sect; 66-d (2), in requiring regulated gas corporations with excess transportation capacity to deliver customer-owned natural gas to all those who seek their services within their franchise territory to the extent of their capabilities, converts such corporations, including plaintiff, to a common carrier, there is no violation of plaintiff's due process rights; defendant Public Service Commission's order requiring plaintiff to file tariffs for the transportation of customer-owned gas amounts to nothing more&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  than extending plaintiff's service to an area that it is already committed to serve.  Plaintiff has not proved the statute unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt; development of in-State natural gas supplies will be stimulated and the natural gas market in the State will be more competitive to the benefit of consumers; with respect to constitutional due process, a State is free to adopt whatever economic policy will promote the public welfare. Finally, there is a rational basis for requiring plaintiff to provide the service of delivering customer-owned natural gas and it is entirely rational for defendant to only permit plaintiff to recover the cost of providing the expanded transportation and delivery duties; there has been no taking without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of her conviction for criminal possession of marihuana, contending she was improperly charged and that the search of her property was illegal. The court affirmed the conviction, finding that defendant was properly charged under N.Y.

The court further concluded that both the aerial and foot searches of defendant's property prior to obtaining a search warrant were not improper. The court found that the aerial observation could form the basis for a search warrant, as there was no expectation of privacy from such observation. The court also concluded that the foot searches were a proper basis upon which to obtain a search warrant. The court found that the items seized from defendant's property not specifically identified in the search warrant were in compliance with the &quot;plain view&quot; doctrine as the officer was in a lawful position to observe the items, his observation was inadvertent rather that anticipated, and the incriminating character of the items was immediately apparent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The petition was dismissed on the ground that the proceeding was barred by statute of limitations because the proceeding was not commenced within four months of the date that the commission's decision was mailed to the taxpayer, as required by N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1090(e). The taxpayer served an amended petition alleging that the commission's decision violated constitutional and jurisdictional laws. The court confirmed the commission's determination and dismissed the amended petition. The taxpayer contended that the limitations period was inapplicable to its petition because a statutory exclusive remedy provision was inapplicable where a petition in a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding claimed that an administrative agency acted unconstitutionally or lacked jurisdiction. The court did not agree that the fact that the taxpayer asserted such claims in its amended petition ousted the provisions of N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1090. Where the taxpayer sought the very kind of judicial review authorized by &sect; 1090, the provision of that statute that a decision by the commission was deemed final for statute of limitations purposes, should not have been negated by the assertion of certain claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant former husband appealed the judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term of Richmond County (New York), which granted plaintiff former wife a divorce on the ground of abandonment, distributed marital assets, and awarded the wife maintenance and attorney fees. A motion to intervene by proposed intervenor pension fund was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After 33 years of marriage, the wife was granted a divorce on the ground of abandonment, under N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 170(2). A substantial portion of the marital property was attributed to the husband's pension fund. He worked for the fire department throughout the entire marriage, and she was a housewife. The special term court directed the husband to select a pension plan payment option that did not limit the wife's survivorship benefits. The pension fund sought to intervene under N.Y. C.P.L.R. Law &sect;&sect; 1012(a)(2), 1013 for the purpose of rearguing the pension distribution determination on constitutional and statutory grounds. The court held that the special term court erred in refusing the intervention because the pension fund had a real and substantial interest in the proceedings. The court held that the special term court had the authority under the 1980 Equitable Distribution Law, N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 281, to decree that there were two owners of the pension contract and to adopt appropriate measures to protect the ownership interests of both the husband and wife. The limitation of the husband's choices of pension plan payment options protected the wife's co-ownership rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed all provisions of the divorce and distribution of the marital property, including the directives regarding the husband's pension fund payment options. However, the order denying the pension fund leave to intervene was reversed because the pension fund had a real and substantial interest in the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Intervention</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In distributing the pension rights of defendant husband, a public employee, in a divorce action, the court awarded&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  plaintiff wife a one-half interest and to insure her ability to receive that interest, it restricted defendant's choice among the payment options.  Although Special Term properly denied the pension fund leave to intervene as of right since the standards of CPLR 1012 (a) (2) were not met, it was error to refuse permission to intervene under CPLR 1013.  The fund, which sought to intervene, after Special Term's decision but before entry of judgment for the purpose of rearguing the pension distribution determination on constitutional and statutory grounds, had a real and substantial interest in the proceedings.  The error is curable without a remittitur since by the Appellate Division's exercise of discretion to permit intervention on appeal, it will entertain the same argument that would have been made at Special Term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Husband and Wife -- Divorce -- Abandonment -- Equitable Distribution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action for divorce brought by a 58-year-old housewife married for 33 years to a 62-year-old fire department employee, plaintiff's testimony was sufficient to establish the unjustified and nonconsensual departure which constitutes abandonment.  It was not improper for the court to divide&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the husband's pension rights, which constituted the major marital asset, equally; the maintenance award of $ 225 per week was not excessive and the argument that it should not have been permitted to continue indefinitely is meritless because the payments were to terminate upon defendant's retirement, a matter of three years; it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to require defendant to maintain the existing medical coverage or its equivalent for plaintiff's benefit and, under the circumstances, there is no reason to insert a termination date for that obligation.  Finally, the award of attorney's fees reflected no abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Husband and Wife -- Equitable Distribution -- Pension Rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In distributing the pension rights of defendant husband, a public employee, in a divorce action, the court properly awarded plaintiff wife a one-half interest and to insure her ability to receive that interest, it properly restricted defendant's choice among the payment options to permit plaintiff to share in the payments as made and in any further distribution after her husband's death.  The method of distribution is discretionary and must be contoured to suit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the particular circumstances, needs and means of the parties in the case.  Restrictive terminology created to protect pensions against judicial process invoked by creditors and assignees </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; B19-7.941) cannot be read as prohibiting the use of judicial power to protect an award of pension rights to a spouse, and although NY Constitution, article V, &sect; 7 prevents reduction by the public employer of the financial benefits promised in the pension contract, an equitable distribution court's award of an interest in a pension contract to a nonmember spouse does not unconstitutionally diminish or impair the plan member's pension or the contractual rights to it; judicial restriction of option or beneficiary choices does not diminish a pension in the sense that a lesser amount will be paid.  The judiciary may constitutionally and legally determine and decree that there are two owners of the pension contract and it has the discretion to constitutionally and legally adopt appropriate measures to protect the ownership interests of both.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted upon a jury verdict of burglary in the first degree and of robbery in the first and second degree. The People filed a felony statement at the sentencing hearing for the purpose of having him sentenced as a second felony offender pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.06 and N.Y. Crim. Proc.

Defendant argued successfully that the 1974 and 1975 felonies could not be used as predicate felonies because he had not been advised of the constitutional rights that he was waiving as a result of those guilty pleas. Defendant appealed his conviction and the People appealed the denial of their request that defendant be adjudicated a second felony offender. The court found that defendant's argument of prosecutorial misconduct had not been preserved for review because defendant failed to object at trial to the prosecutrix's summation statement. The court found that defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender on the 1975 conviction and that the 1974 conviction had served as the predicate felony for that sentence.

The family court dismissed the petition based upon human leucocyte antigen (HLA) testing that showed that there was no probability that the ex-boyfriend was the father. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal finding that the mother failed to meet her burden of showing that N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 532(a) was unconstitutional or that the family court erred in admitting the results of the HLA test. The court found that the HLA test was reliable in paternity actions and it was reasonable for the family court to rely upon the test results because a qualified expert testified with personal knowledge that the tests were prepared and kept in the regular course of business. The court found that although HLA test results were not definitive or conclusive of paternity, the family court, as the trier of fact, properly made its own assessment of the weight to be accorded to the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners floating homes were harbored at the marina. Section 213-107 restricted the mooring or docking of vessels designed for or occupied as dwelling units. Shortly after the ordinance was adopted, the marina owner filed a condominium offering plan expressly excluding parties who intended to dock floating homes. On appeal, the owners argued that they were entitled as a matter of law to purchase slips at the marina because they were tenants in occupancy on the date the condominium offering plan was accepted for filing. The court affirmed the dismissal of the owners' action because the marina owner extended exclusive purchase period rights and other incentives only to tenants possessing written occupancy agreements, which the owners did not possess. The offer was not extended to parties intending to dock floating homes and that restriction was reinforced through a restrictive covenant incorporated into the deeds to the slip units. Therefore, regardless of the ordinance, the owners are not entitled to remain at the marina.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court finding that the local law did not violate the equal protection clause. The court found that the classification and exemptions were related to a permissible public purpose. The court held that the association's contention that the law was not one of general applicability and was unduly burdensome to those affected, was without basis. The legislative purpose of curtailing discriminatory practice in clubs whose character and operation made them public accommodations by clearly defined standards did not violate due process or the equal protection of the law, because the definition excluded other clubs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The fuel supplier provided gas to retail establishments within Indian reservations and a tax was assessed on the sale. Due to the lower cost, customers, other than those actually living on the reservations, came to buy the gas at lower prices avoiding taxation. The tax collecting authority desired to remedy the situation and amended the tax laws. The commission then attempted to retroactively collect taxes from the fuel supplier and an injunction was sought and obtained. From this, the commission sought review. On appeal, the court found that the amended laws did not appear unconstitutional. The court found that a main issue was whether the commission imposed a burden on the fuel supplier that exceeded the permissible &quot;minimal burden of collection&quot; standard and that this was in fact lacking. The court surmised that the fuel supplier failed to establish the clear likelihood of success on the merits required for a showing of their entitlement to a preliminary injunction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles of the State of New York and the Department of Motor Vehicles, appealed the decision of the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), which denied defendants' motion for summary judgement, in plaintiff registrant's declaratory judgment action challenging the suspension of her registration under N.Y.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a declaratory judgment action challenging the suspension of the registration of plaintiff's vehicle pursuant to Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 318 for a period representing the number of days of lapsed insurance coverage, defendants' motion for summary judgment should have been granted.  To the extent that summary judgment was denied on the ground that a proper determination of the complaint requires resolution of the outstanding issues of fact described in plaintiff's opposing papers, a declaratory judgment action was an inappropriate method to review defendants' administrative actions.  Plaintiff is precluded from basing her suit on claims that there was in fact no lapse in coverage or that her insurer's notice of termination was improper; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  there is no proof that plaintiff submitted evidence at the administrative level to support these claims or that she pursued her administrative remedies to show that she had valid, continuous insurance coverage, as she was invited to do in two letters from defendants.</SPAN></P>

In an action wherein plaintiff challenged the suspension of the registration of her vehicle pursuant to Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 318 for a period representing the number of days of lapsed insurance coverage, defendants' motion for summary judgment should have been granted.  In ordering suspension on the basis of plaintiff's insurer's notification that the proof of insurance was no longer in effect and in extending that suspension for the period during which, on the basis of the available evidence, there was a lapse in coverage, defendants' actions were completely consistent with the statutory framework </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 312 [1] [a]; &sect; 318 [1-a] [a]), and there is no basis upon which an estoppel can be applied against defendants.</SPAN></P>

In an action wherein plaintiff challenged the suspension of the registration of her vehicle pursuant to Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 318 for a period representing the number of days of lapsed insurance coverage, defendants' motion for summary judgment should have been granted.  The issue of the existence of coverage and proper termination thereof is one of relative simplicity, largely determinable on the basis of documentary evidence; a registrant can be relieved of any suspension imposed for lapse of coverage merely by paying a civil penalty of $ 4 for each day during which no insurance was in effect (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 318 [1-a] [b]); judicial review is available through a CPLR article 78 proceeding; and the burden and delay in having to hold a full, evidentiary hearing before suspension in every case would largely thwart the strong State policy to bar uninsured vehicles from the public highways.  Minimal due process requirements of notice and an opportunity to be heard were complied with, since plaintiff received advance notification of the proposed suspension and the basis therefor and was invited to submit proof of continued, valid coverage; accordingly, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 318 is not unconstitutional as a violation of plaintiff's due process rights.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The union represented the employee's division. He was not a union member but agency shop fees equal to membership dues were deducted from his salary pursuant to N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 208(3)(a). In 1982 and 1983 the employee timely requested the return of that portion of his fees that was used to support ideological causes not germane to collective bargaining activities. He received small refunds for both years. The employee filed suit, alleging that N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 208(3) violated U.S. Constitution amends. I, XIV and sought, among other things, an injunction to prevent the union from spending agency shop fees on impermissible services. The union filed a motion to dismiss, which the lower court granted. The parties cross-appealed and the court reversed only that part of the lower court's order that granted the union's motion to dismiss. The court held that the lower court erred in granting the motion because the employee's objection to the assessment of agency shop fees was timely filed and because his argument was primarily a challenge to the constitutionality of the union's procedures, he had not needed to demonstrate an exhaustion of his administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff homeless families sought review of orders issued by the Supreme Court at Special Term, New York County (New York) in the consolidated cases brought against defendants, mayor and city and state social service agency officials, to obtain suitable emergency housing, due process rights upon transfer from emergency housing, and funds for the transportation of school children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the two consolidated cases plaintiff homeless families sought injunctive relief requiring defendants, mayor and city and state social services officials, to provide plaintiff with suitable emergency shelter, school transportation allowances, and notice and hearing prior to termination of emergency shelter. On appeal from lower court orders, the court first prohibited defendants from denying emergency shelter to plaintiff, citing the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, social services statutes, and N.Y. Const. art. XVII, &sect; 1. The court then concluded that N.Y Const. art. XVII, &sect; 1 did not entitle plaintiff to any standard of suitability with regard to emergency shelter. Additionally, the court held that emergency shelter residents had no due process right upon transfer and that the assignment of families to mass shelters was permissible. Finally, the court required plaintiff's automatic entitlement to a school transportation allowance when residing in emergency shelter. The court reversed the orders involving the provision of emergency shelter and due process rights, modified the transportation allowance ruling, and affirmed the mass shelter order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed orders in plaintiff homeless families' case against defendants, mayor and city and state social services agency officials, and thereby required that emergency shelter be provided to plaintiff and denied due process rights upon transfer. The court modified the transportation allowance order to make funds available automatically, and affirmed the order permitting plaintiff's placement in mass shelters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Social Services -- Emergency Housing for Homeless Families</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An order which denied a motion by proposed plaintiffs-intervenors, homeless families who allegedly had unsuccessfully requested emergency shelter from defendants, to intervene in an action commenced against defendants by other homeless families concerning their entitlement to emergency shelter, and for a preliminary injunction barring defendants from denying shelter to eligible families is reversed.  The provision of emergency housing to the proposed intervenors did not moot their claims; the questions presented are of public importance and significance, likely to recur and yet evade review; thus, a preliminary injunction barring denial of emergency shelter to homeless families is granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Social Services -- Emergency Housing for Homeless Families -- Preliminary Injunction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiffs, homeless families with children, are entitled to a preliminary injunction barring State and municipal defendants who are charged with the administration of programs to assist homeless families in locating housing, from denying emergency shelter to homeless families. The irreparable injury to be sustained by homeless families clearly outweighs the burden that providing temporary emergency shelter imposes upon defendants, and plaintiffs have demonstrated a high probability of success on the merits.  Further, public interest strongly favors an injunction pending a final determination on the merits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Social Services -- Emergency Housing for Homeless Families -- State Plan for Emergency Assistance to Needy Families with Children</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In an action seeking a preliminary injunction barring State and municipal defendants who are charged with the administration of programs to assist homeless families in locating housing, from denying emergency shelter to homeless families, plaintiffs have a high probability of establishing that defendant City of New York is mandated to provide&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  emergency shelter to eligible families for 30 days in one 12-month period pursuant to the State Plan for Emergency Assistance to Needy Families with Children (EAF).  The State's participation in the EAF program obligates the New York City Department of Social Services (City DSS), budgetary constraints notwithstanding, to secure the amount of emergency shelter necessary for homeless families found within the City's borders; the duty to provide emergency assistance is not limited to the provision of cash benefits and ancillary services.  Moreover, plaintiffs have a high probability of establishing that in failing to assure emergency shelter for all eligible homeless families, both the State and City DSS have violated the Social Security Act requirement of mandatory enforcement of the State Plan (42 USC &sect; 602 [a] [1]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection of Laws -- Denial of Emergency Shelter to Homeless Families</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Under the equal protection guarantees of the State and Federal Constitutions, any classification which denies to one class of needy persons public assistance which is available to all others, cannot be justified unless it is rationally related to a legitimate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  State interest.  Thus, since defendant City of New York makes emergency shelter available to homeless single men, there is no apparent reasonable basis for the City's denial of emergency shelter to plaintiffs, homeless families with children; the needs of plaintiffs are greater than those of single adults, and defendants' less than equal treatment of plaintiffs is plainly irrational.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Social Services -- Emergency Housing for Homeless Families -- Duty of State to Aid Needy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The policy of defendant New York City Department of Social Services in administering the State Plan for Emergency Assistance to Needy Families with Children to only provide cash allowances and information concerning housing availability rather than to provide emergency shelter for homeless families contravenes both the letter and spirit of the State's affirmative obligation to aid all its needy residents under NY Constitution, article XVII, &sect; 1. Article XVII was intended to require the State to take positive steps to assist the needy, and the provision for assistance is a positive duty, not a matter of legislative grace.  In view of the scarcity of decent low-income housing, the City's policy simply&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ignores the brutal realities of plaintiffs' situation and amounts to a denial of aid to homeless families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Social Services -- Emergency Housing for Homeless Families -- Minimal Standards for Housing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. It was error to compel the State and municipal defendants to comply with reasonable, minimal standards of cleanliness, warmth, space and rudimentary conveniences in providing emergency shelter to plaintiffs, homeless families with children.  The adequacy of the level of welfare benefits is a matter committed to the discretion of the Legislature.  Although plaintiffs have documented the unsafe and squalid conditions prevalent in welfare hotel accommodations, the emergency housing provided by defendants is more than token, and is genuine and meaningful.  Thus, in light of the Legislature's broad discretion, plaintiffs are not likely to prove that NY Constitution article XVII substantively guarantees minimal physical standards in emergency shelter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Injunctions -- When Injunctive Relief Appropriate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The codification of more extensive minimal standards for emergency shelter for homeless families with children in 18 NYCRR 352.3 than those contained in an interim order&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  granted in an action by plaintiffs, homeless families with children, against the State and municipal defendants who administer programs to assist homeless families in locating housing, did not render partially moot defendants' challenge to a preliminary injunction, which compelled defendants to comply with the minimal standards contained in the interim order. The issuance of the regulations obviated the need for injunctive relief essentially duplicative in nature.  Moreover, since the system of procedural safeguards for such homeless families delineated in the interim order duplicates those already set forth more extensively in social services regulations, and only isolated instances of violations of those safeguards exist, injunctive relief compelling defendants to comply with the safeguards contained in the order was unwarranted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Social Services -- Emergency Housing for Homeless Families -- Hearing before Transfer to Alternate Facility -- Due Process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. In an action by plaintiffs, homeless families with children, against municipal defendants who administer programs to assist homeless families in locating housing, an order which denied defendants' motion to vacate a temporary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  restraining order prohibiting transfer of emergency shelter recipients to alternate facilities until notice and an opportunity to be heard were given is reversed.  The requirement for a hearing before transfer interferes with the newly established State inspection procedures for hotel and motel facilities set forth in 18 NYCRR 352.3 (h) and would often effectively preclude relocation since alternative placements would become unavailable pending a hearing.  Moreover, emergency shelter residents do not have a due process right to be housed in any particular neighborhood or type of housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Social Services -- Emergency Housing for Homeless Families - Mass Shelters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. In an action by plaintiffs, homeless families with children, against the State and municipal defendants who administer programs to assist homeless families in locating housing, the closing of mass shelters for homeless families will not be compelled in light of the broad discretion vested in the Legislature regarding the adequacy of the level of welfare benefits.  While mass shelters are not good environments, they afford families food, security, outdoor recreational space, and social services which do not exist&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at emergency hotel placements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Social Services -- Emergency Housing for Homeless Families -- Responsibility of State Commissioner of Social Services</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. A proceeding against respondent Commissioners of the State Department of Social Services (DSS) and the New York City Department of Social Services seeking a preliminary injunction requiring respondent Commissioners to provide emergency housing to petitioners, homeless families with children, within the area where their minor children attend school or to provide transportation allowances based on actual costs where necessary, is dismissed as to respondent State Commissioner.  Social Services Law &sect; 62 places primary responsibility upon the local social services agencies for the delivery of services and assistance to needy families; only the City DSS is the relevant party because it alone is accountable for the direct payment of actual transportation expenses incurred by or for relocation of homeless families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Social Services -- Emergency Housing for Homeless Families -- School Transportation Allowance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Under NY Constitution, article XI, &sect; 1 and Education Law article 65, the State must provide free education&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to all children over age five; moreover, Education Law &sect; 3209 squarely places responsibility upon public welfare officials in local social services districts to provide indigent children with the necessaries to enable them to attend school, which include funds for school transportation. Accordingly, respondent New York City Department of Social Services policy of providing a flat travel allowance of $ 18 per week to eligible homeless families residing in emergency shelters whose children must commute to school is inadequate and is unconstitutional in that it deprives indigent children of the right to free education and amounts to a refusal to aid needy children; respondent is obligated to provide actual transportation expenses, both for children until they obtain transportation passes from the Board of Education, and for the parents of young children who must be accompanies to school.  Moreover, Social Services Law &sect; 350-j and 18 NYCRR 372.4 (d) also mandate payment of such transportation expenses; homeless families who are eligible for emergency shelter under the program for Emergency Assistance to Needy Families with Children are automatically entitled to a transportation allowance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  if they have been relocated at a distance from their former communities and their children's schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Actions -- Class Actions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. A determination granting class action certification in a proceeding seeking to compel respondent Commissioner of the Department of Social Services of the City of New York to provide emergency housing to petitioners within the area where their minor children attend school or to provide transportation allowances based on actual costs for children and for their parents where necessary is reversed; class certification is superfluous where there is no evidence of unwillingness on the part of respondent government official to comply with and apply court rulings equally to all persons similarly situated.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the board's cross motion for partial summary judgment dismissing the first three causes of action in the complaint. The court affirmed on the merits. The board was not required to formally promulgate, in accordance with the State Administrative Procedure Act, its policy regarding the calculation of jobs created by expanding an existing corporation because the policy did not constitute a rule or regulation. Rather, the guideline was an interpretive statement that in itself had no legal effect, but was merely explanatory. The policy was drafted in response to staff requests for guidelines to aid them in giving advice and assistance to applicants. Although the guideline was developed when the board was attempting to establish a set of objective criteria to be determinative in each case, during the period the board did not consider the policy either fixed or determinative. When the board finally developed fixed, determinative standards, it formally promulgated rules and regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county levied taxes upon the city pursuant to the Law. While the city had the power to repeal the Law, the city failed to specifically identify its intent to do so when it adopted its new city charter. The city then amended its charter to specifically and expressly repeal the Law. Subsequently, the city did not pay the entire amount of taxes which the county levied. The county commenced an action to recover the deficiency, and was awarded summary judgment for the unpaid amount by the special term. In affirming summary judgment for the county, the court held that the amendment that repealed the law could not have been given retroactive effect. The court held that the city incurred the obligation to pay, and the county acquired a vested property right in the taxes levied when the final levy was in place, and the subsequent amendment could not have prevented the county from obtaining the second half of the entire amount of the levy from the city. Further, the court held that retroactive application in that situation was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Alternatively, relitigation of the standing issue is barred by the doctrine of res judicata, since plaintiffs' present challenge emanates from the same factual source as the earlier litigation and centers around the exact same issue and at the time of the initial lawsuit plaintiffs were voters and had the opportunity to sue in that capacity; the previous determination that plaintiffs lacked standing was on the merits insofar as the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  standing issue is concerned and res judicata pertains not only to matters actually litigated, but also to any which might readily have been litigated. </SPAN></P>

The Commission sustained the assessment, the trial court dismissed the taxpayers' petition for review on the merits, and the court affirmed. Since gain or loss could not be determined until the end of the taxable year under N.Y.

Health Law &sect;&sect; 206, 2803, and fined the hospital $ 4,000 for the hospital's refusal to allow the department of health access to examine certain patients. The commissioner sustained the charges and the fine. The supreme court at special term confirmed the determination and dismissed the hospital's petition to annul the commissioner's determination. On review, the court modified the judgment by reversing the $ 4,000 fine and reducing it to $ 1,000, and as modified, affirmed. The court ruled that the 1981 amendment to N.Y. Pub.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant comptroller sought review of seven judgments from the Supreme Court at Special Term, Albany County (New York), which, in proceedings pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78, annulled the comptroller's decisions to suspend the payment of retirement benefits to respondent employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employees filed for retirement between the date of reelection to their judicial offices in November and the following January, when their reelection terms commenced. Each employee received retirement benefits in addition to a judicial salary under a procedure sanctioned by custom under N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 150. After &sect; 150 was amended, the comptroller notified the employees that the retirement benefits would be suspended. They instituted N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceedings on the ground that the action violated N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 7. The trial court held that amended N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 150 could not be constitutionally applied to those who retired before its effective date and directed payment to the employees. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that the intention of the legislature when it enacted &sect; 150 was to encourage retirees to run for public office, but it was not applicable to employees who filed for retirement from their judicial offices after their reelection to such offices and before the commencement of their new terms. The amendment to &sect; 150, which amplified that intent, was not a change in the law; thus, there was no constitutional impairment.</SPAN></P>

Judgments annulling a determination of respondent Comptroller suspending the payment of retirement benefits to petitioners are reversed and the petitions dismissed, petitioners having filed for retirement benefits between the date of reelection to their respective judicial offices in November and the following January 1, when their reelection terms commenced; after commencement of their new terms, each petitioner began receiving retirement benefits in addition to a full judicial salary pursuant to respondents' interpretation of the &quot;elective public office&quot; exception contained in Civil Service Law &sect; 150, which generally suspends the retirement benefits of persons who, subsequent to their retirement&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from State service, accept public office, but following the effective date of a 1984 amendment to section 150 providing that any person who, subsequent to his retirement from an elective public office, is reelected, shall have his retirement allowance suspended, petitioners were notified that their retirement benefits would be suspended immediately.  The &quot;elective public office&quot; exception contained in Civil Service Law &sect; 150 prior to the amendment did not apply to petitioners, all of whom filed for retirement from their judicial offices after their reelection to such offices and before the commencement of their new terms in such offices; the purpose of the statute was to encourage retired public officers to run for elective public office, and since the amendment did not effect a substantive change in Civil Service Law &sect; 150 as to petitioners, there has been no unconstitutional impairment of their retirement benefits or vested contractual rights; further, the doctrine of estoppel is not applicable to create rights to retirement benefits to which there is no entitlement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner taxpayer sought review of the decision from respondent Tax Commission of the State of New York (Commissioner), which sustained notices of deficiency issued to the taxpayer for its failure to file a franchise tax report for a corporation located in Puerto Rico that was under the same ownership as the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer and a Puerto Rican company were both owned by the same three stockholders and had the same board of directors. The Puerto Rican company sold 90 percent of its product to the taxpayer and did no advertising for other sales. The state issued a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer for failure to file a franchise report for the Puerto Rican company and the taxpayer filed a petition for redetermination. The commissioner denied the petition and the taxpayer challenged the decision. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the franchise report was necessary under N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 211(4) to properly reflect the taxpayer's tax liability. The undisputed facts showed that the two companies were engaged in a unitary business, had substantial inter-corporate transactions, and were under the same ownership. Thus, a combined report fulfilled the statutory purpose of more realistically portraying true income. The tax did not conflict with federal legislation granting a tax credit for investment in companies located in United States territories because Congress did not clearly manifest an intention to preempt state police powers.</SPAN></P>

There was ample evidence to support the Commission's conclusion that petitioner and its subsidiary were engaged in a unitary business and had substantial intercorporate transactions; under all the circumstances, combined reporting fulfills the purpose of Tax Law &sect; 211 (4) of avoiding distortion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of and more realistically portraying true income; requiring petitioner to file a combined tax return is not preempted by the supremacy clause (US Const, art VI, &sect; 2), since Federal legislation providing a tax credit for taxable income received from sources outside the United States attributable to the conduct of a business within a United States possession is not at variance with the New York statute (Tax Law &sect; 209 [1]) in that the power to tax exists independently of the Federal Constitution and a State's power to tax can coexist with a predominantly Federal power such as the regulation of commerce. Finally, New York net income is to be computed without deducting the amount of a tax credit permitted under Federal law and since there is clearly provision for inclusion of the amount of a tax credit, there is no usurpation of a legislative function. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A dispute arose between the employees and the trustees as to whether the authority delegated to them by &sect; 355-a was constitutional. The employees sought a declaration that it was not. The lower court granted the trustees' motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court modified the lower court's judgment by declaring that &sect; 355-a was constitutional and otherwise affirmed the judgment. The trustees were properly delegated the task of determining a salary schedule for a state university system's professional employees. That determination was not susceptible to rigid formulas. Nevertheless, the enabling legislation was constitutional because it provided sufficient guidelines for the trustees. Nor was the schedule unconstitutional or arbitrary and unreasonable based on its distinction between employees of two and four-year colleges. As to the employees' claim for back pay, they failed even though the lower court should have retained jurisdiction over them. That was so because the claims were based on the premise that the salary schedule was arbitrary, which the court rejected.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer also claimed that the statute violated his constitutional right to equal protection of the laws because other political subdivisions of the state received total reimbursement for such security costs. The administrative judge and the state moved for summary judgment, which the lower court granted. The taxpayer sought review. On review, the court examined N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 39 and found that it did not mandate full reimbursement to localities for security costs. It merely created a technical change in the means of reimbursement. The court rejected the taxpayer's equal protection argument because the state had a rational basis for reimbursing security costs in different areas of the state in varying proportions. The court found no issue of fact in dispute to require a trial and held that summary judgment was appropriately granted.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the taxpayer asserted that the retroactive assessment of a sales tax deficiency was unconstitutional and inequitable, and that its annual and advance charges were exempt from sales tax pursuant to N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1105(c)(3)(iii). The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, holding that the exemption of &sect; 1105(c)(3)(iii) for additions or capital improvements to real property did not apply because the taxpayer retained the right to remove the alarm system. Likewise, the advance services charges for installation of local and central systems were taxable installation charges, given that the taxpayer retained ownership of the alarm systems. The retroactive assessment was constitutional because the taxpayer did not prove that he relied on a prior commission interpretation of &sect; 1105(c)(3)(iii) and the commission's change of interpretation was not palpably unjust.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the decision from the Otsego County Court (New York), which entered judgment convicting defendant of second-degree manslaughter. Defendant raised issues concerning the failure to change venue, improper void dire, the holding of the trial in a church hall, the admittance of evidence, the denial of a motion to suppress, the sufficiency of the evidence, a jury charge, and the sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's original conviction was reversed. In the second trial, defendant was acquitted of reckless murder, but he was convicted of the lesser-included offense. On appeal, the court agreed with the trial court in full. While a defendant had a constitutional right to a fair trial, the fact that the jury was aware of the crime prior to trial did not make the trial unfair. The presence of the media in voir dire did not prejudice defendant. The holding of the trial in a church hall, while not ideal, did not render the trial unfair. Evidence that defendant struck the victim was admissible. The state did not violate the appellate court's finding that a motion to suppress should have been granted in the first trial. The evidence the state used was not the subject of the first suppression motion. Also, the evidence was too attenuated to be the fruit of the poisonous tree. Evidence supported the conviction. The evidence did not support a finding that defendant should have been convicted of criminal negligent homicide or reckless endangerment instead. The jury was properly charged. The sentence was properly enhanced for a prior record.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Law of the Case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On appeal to the Appellate Division from a judgment convicting defendant of manslaughter in the second degree, allegations of error as to the denial by the Appellate Division of two pretrial motions to change venue are not properly raised since the decisions denying the motions are the law of the case; however, the issue will be treated as a contention that defendant was denied his constitutional right to a fair trial by an impartial jury by reason of extensive pretrial publicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Fair Trial -- Publicity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant's conviction of manslaughter in the second degree, following a second trial after a prior conviction of reckless murder was reversed by the Court of Appeals, was not obtained in a trial atmosphere that had been utterly corrupted by press coverage; although the publicity surrounding the initial trial, the appellate proceedings and the retrial was extensive and involved confessions and other evidence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which the Court of Appeals ordered suppressed upon the second trial, the voir dire examination of the jurors for the second trial was extensive and thorough and provided an opportunity to eliminate jurors who were aware of the suppressed evidence or who were otherwise unable to render an impartial verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Voir Dire -- Exclusion of Media and Public</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The voir dire examination of jurors for defendant's second trial on a charge of reckless murder, following reversal by the Court of Appeals of his prior conviction on that charge, was not improperly conducted on the ground that the media and public were not excluded while jurors were questioned regarding publicity as to prejudicial matters thereby resulting in other potential jurors being informed of the prejudicial matters; the media was already aware of the prejudicial matters, had been reporting them throughout the history of the litigation and was free to continue to report them and, thus, the presence of the media did not prejudice defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Fair Trial -- Trial Held in Church Hall</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Defendant was not denied a fair and public trial because, due to courthouse renovations, his trial was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  held in the church hall of a Roman Catholic church; while the church hall was a private building, public access was not restricted during the trial; further, although the church hall may not have been an ideal place for the trial, the religious environment was not so pervasive as to deny defendant a fair trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Evidence -- Admissibility of Evidence Relevant to Prior Acquittal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. At the second trial of defendant on a charge of reckless murder, following his prior acquittal on an intentional murder charge and reversal by the Court of Appeals of his prior conviction of reckless murder, evidence that defendant struck the victim was properly admitted; although the principle of double jeopardy prohibited retrial of the intentional murder charge, the mere fact that evidence was relevant to the intentional murder count does not necessarily mean that it was inadmissible at the second trial; evidence that defendant struck the victim also bore some relevance to the reckless murder charge, particularly with regard to defendant's awareness that the victim was seriously injured; further, such evidence is relevant in establishing that defendant had a duty to aid the victim, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in response to defendant's argument that he was not required to be a good Samaritan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Matters Reviewable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Allegations by defendant of error as to statements made by the prosecution during summation were not preserved for review where defendant failed to make timely objections or requests for corrective instructions; moreover, the comments do not warrant reversal as an exercise of discretion in the interest of justice ( CPL 470.15 [6] [a]).</SPAN></P>

Evidence consisting of the victim's body, police officers' testimony regarding what they saw at the time of the arrest and an inculpatory spontaneous utterance by defendant, admitted at the second trial of defendant on a charge of reckless murder, did not violate the prior decision of the Court of Appeals suppressing statements made by defendant to a police informant, a written confession and incriminating items discovered in defendant's car by police pursuant to a search warrant, and will not be suppressed on the ground that they were fruits of the unlawfully obtained statements made to the informant; inasmuch as the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  decision of the Court of Appeals did not involve any new or novel interpretation of law which would justify the failure to seek suppression of all the evidence at issue prior to the first trial, it was limited to those items of evidence defendant had timely sought to suppress, and defendant did not seek to suppress the victim's body or the observations of the arresting officer until just before the second trial.  Moreover, even if defendant's contention had been properly raised, it would be rejected on the merits since the defendant's independent act in consciously choosing to move the victim's body for burial at the informant's logging site, which was not planned by the informant or police, along with the fact that, prior to the illegality, the police had strong reason to investigate defendant, acted to dissipate the taint of the unlawfully obtained statements.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. In the prosecution of defendant charged with reckless murder where the court charged the jury as to the lesser included offense of second degree manslaughter and the jury asked twice how the charge would be affected if the victim had died instantly or if defendant so believed, County Court's answers that the charge presupposed that the victim was alive after she sustained the injuries and that failure to obtain medical attention caused her death were not misleading; from the tenor of the questions, it is clear that the jury was cognizant of this crucial factual issue in the case; in no way could the answers be misinterpreted to indicate that the jury had to assume that the victim was alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Instructions -- Requests to Charge Jury</SPAN></P>

The new sentence which takes the place of a revoked sentence of probation can properly form the basis for a predicate felony conviction; further, a reformatory sentence suffices as a sentence of imprisonment for the purposes of persistent felony offender sentencing; thus, where defendant's sentence of probation for a felony conviction of second degree forgery was revoked, and defendant was sentenced to a reformatory term of 0 to 4 years, the reformatory sentence can properly serve as the basis for his sentencing as a persistent felony offender; moreover, defendant's prior conviction was not unconstitutionally obtained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Harsh and Excessive Sentence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. The sentencing of defendant, who was convicted of second degree manslaughter arising out of the death of an 18-year-old girl after she was abandoned in an injured condition in a secluded area on a winter night by defendant, as a persistent felony offender and imposing the maximum sentence authorized of 25 years to life is neither harsh nor excessive considering the heinous nature of the crime and the obvious fact that defendant must be removed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from society for the protection of its citizens; that the sentence imposed was the same as that imposed upon his subsequently reversed prior conviction of second degree murder based on the girl's death cannot be construed as a penalty for defendant having succeeded on appeal since defendant was not charged as a persistent felony offender after the first trial.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The recoupment was made pursuant to a department directive which instituted a program providing inmates free postage for five letters per week and deducting from an inmate's account, the cost of excess postage.

The court held that there was no equal protection violation because there was a rational distinction between the recoupment of money from an inmate's account and a garnishment against the wages of a judgment debtor. The court held that compelling inmates to reimburse the state for the cost of excess postage did not deprive them of their property without due process. The court reasoned that unlike a judgement debtor, no judgment was docketed against the inmate and there was no provision for recoupment after he was released from prison.</SPAN></P>

The association appealed, seeking a judgment declaring the invalidity of &sect; 19 as implemented by defendants. The court modified the trial court's order by declaring that &sect; 19 was not void and unenforceable because &sect;&sect; 20 and 21 mandated that the hospitals be fully reimbursed for the cost of providing the excess coverage. The court found that the imposition on the hospitals of substantial costs in procuring the excess coverage sufficiently raised doubts as to the legislation's constitutionality and thus, the court declared that &sect;&sect; 20 and 21 required full reimbursement to the hospitals, in an effort to more widely distribute the cost burden among the ultimate consumers of health services, as intended by the Act.</SPAN></P>

Before the proceeding came on for trial, the New York City, N.Y., Administrative Code &sect; D26-10.10 (1983) was signed into law. The lower court dismissed the proceeding on the ground that the new pet law, &sect; D26-10.10 applied retroactively to protect appellant because he had maintained his pet openly and notoriously for the requisite three-month period. Respondent sought review and the appellate court reversed the lower court's judgment and reinstated the proceeding. Appellant sought review and the court reversed the order of the appellate court and reinstated the judgment of the lower court that had dismissed the case. The court found that the law protected a tenant whose landlord had knowledge of the harboring of a pet for more than three months prior to the commencement of an action or proceeding to enforce the lease. The court held that to evict appellant after six years of openly living with a dog in the premises, would have completely frustrated the intentions of &sect; D26-10.10.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; D26-10.10, effective October 26, 1983, which states that a lease provision prohibiting the harboring of household pets is deemed waived where a tenant openly and notoriously has harbored a household pet for a period of three months or more following taking possession of the apartment and the owner or his agent has knowledge of this fact but fails within the three-month period to commence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a summary proceeding or action to enforce the lease provision, is applicable to an eviction proceeding commenced prior to the law's enactment; the law applies to all existing leases, and while it does not specifically indicate that it is to be applied to pending eviction proceedings, it protects a tenant whose landlord had knowledge of the harboring of a pet for more than three months prior to the commencement of an action or proceeding to enforce the lease. Giving effect to the new law in such a case does not unconstitutionally impair a landlord's preexisting contract rights since the right to contract is not absolute and may be interfered with by subsequent legislation or regulation so long as it is reasonably necessary to further an important public purpose and the measures taken that impair the contract are reasonable and appropriate to effectuate that purpose.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff property owners and defendant Village of Sylvan Beach, N.Y., appealed an order of the Supreme Court at Special Term, Oneida County (New York), which granted in part and denied in part plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment in their declaratory judgment action seeking to invalidate Village of Sylvan Beach, N.Y., Local Laws, 1977, No. 1, art. X, on the ground that the local law apportioning sewer system costs was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs asserted that the local law failed to assess a tax upon vacant land and that it imposed a tax that was measured solely by the amount of use that a particular property owner made of the sewer system. On appeal by both parties, the court concluded that the special term improperly denied plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on two of the causes of action. The court declared that the local law was invalid as unconstitutional and contrary to law. The court held that the local law was invalid because it imposed no charge on the 300-some vacant properties; the local law therefore placed an unconstitutional burden on the improved properties that were taxed. The court pointed to the well settled law that all properties within an area to be served by an improvement were, to some extent, actually benefitted and were therefore assessable. The court also held that the local law was invalid because the charges were essentially use-based and were not proportionate to or measured by the benefit accruing to the property from being included within the area served by the sewer system. For example, a home on a small lot would have paid the same charge as a home located on several acres.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court unanimously modified, on the law, the order by declaring the law local unconstitutional. The court affirmed in part, agreeing with the special term's determination to dismiss the various enumerated affirmative defenses; however, the court dismissed any remaining defenses except as to the fourth affirmative defense. The court dismissed plaintiffs' appeal of other aspects of the special term's order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with first-degree robbery by a single complaining witness after a photograph lineup followed by lineup identification. Defendant's effort to suppress the identification testimony was unsuccessful. The trial court convicted defendant after it determined that evidence relating to identification had been resolved in a pretrial hearing and would not be permitted in the trial. On appeal, defendant asserted that the trial court erred in its refusal to permit the jury to consider the fairness of the lineup in determining whether defendant's identity had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial because it determined that after identification testimony was determined to be admissible, it was still a matter to be determined by the trier of fact whether the evidence was sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and defendant should have been allowed to introduce evidence to establish that the pretrial procedure was itself so suggestive as to create a reasonable doubt regarding the accuracy of that identification and of any subsequent in-court identification..</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Although a motion to suppress identification testimony made pursuant to CPL article 710 is the exclusive method of challenging the admissibility of such evidence ( CPL 710.70 [3]), a defendant is also entitled to have the jury consider the fairness of pretrial identification procedures in determining whether testimony identifying him as the perpetrator of a crime is sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, where a suppression court had determined that a pretrial lineup had not been unduly suggestive, the trial court erred in striking certain testimony proffered by the defense regarding the composition and conduct of that lineup, and advising the jury that there had already been a judicial determination&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the fairness of the lineup, and a new trial is ordered.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Notwithstanding the suppression court's determination that the photographic procedures utilized were unduly suggestive, the complainant's incourt identification, and evidence of the lineup identification, were properly admitted at the trial of a defendant convicted of robbery in the first degree; the evidence of the complainant's opportunity to view defendant during the perpetration of the crime was sufficient to establish an independent basis, and the lineup identification, which was made approximately three and one-half months after the suggestive photographic procedures, was sufficiently attenuated and was not itself suggestive. </SPAN></P>

The natural parents signed both a judicial and an extrajudicial consent form. Pursuant to N.Y. Dom. Rel.

The trial court rejected their revocation and granted the adoption petition. The natural parents appealed, and the court reversed. The court held that &sect; 115-b was unconstitutional. The statute failed to notify the natural parents of all the legal consequences of revoking their consent. Rather, the extrajudicial consent form was deceptive in conveying that consent could be wholly extinguished within 30 days of the initiation of adoption proceedings.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was on probation and, as a condition, his probation officer was allowed to search his home for drugs. Without obtaining a search warrant under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 410.50(3), the probation officer and police entered defendant's home and after a search they seized drugs. Defendant pleaded guilty to violation of probation and possession of a controlled substance. Defendant appealed alleging that the drugs should be suppressed since no search warrant was obtained prior to the search. The court agreed and reversed his conviction because, under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 410.50(3), absent exigent circumstances a warrant was required even for probationers. The court found no exigent circumstances; therefore, a search warrant was required.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A probation officer's failure to have obtained a prior judicial determination of reasonable cause is enough, standing alone, to invalidate the search of the person or residence of one on probation unless the circumstances with which the probation officer was confronted justify the failure to have done so.  Accordingly, a quantity of marihuana seized from defendant probationer's bedroom by his probation officer should have been suppressed on the basis that the probation officer failed to obtain a search order pursuant to CPL 410.50 (3) before conducting the search, where the probation officer had ample opportunity to submit the matter to the court as required by the statute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and there was no showing of exigency; an order which imposed conditions on defendant's probation and required defendant to permit the search of his person and premises for illegal drugs may not be equated with the court order required to conduct a valid search.  Moreover, a statement signed by defendant in relation to the conditions of probation which asserts that defendant understands and will abide by said conditions does not constitute a waiver of his constitutional or statutory rights.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to possession of a weapon, a felony in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 265.02(1) due to defendant's two prior California convictions. The special information required by N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 200.60 (1) and (2) was not filed when defendant entered his plea, but the lower court adjudged defendant a persistent felony offender under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.10. Defendant appealed, claiming the failure of the prosecution to file the special information resulted in a misdemeanor conviction. The court affirmed, finding the failure a procedural defect that was waived by defendant's voluntary plea. The court found that the two California convictions could not be considered predicate felonies under New York law, however.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified defendant's conviction by vacating his adjudication as a persistent felony offender since the two prior California convictions did not constitute predicate felony offenses that could be used by New York and his sentence was vacated with the matter remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The failure of the prosecution to file the special information required by CPL 200.60 (1, 2) alleging defendant's conviction of a crime prior to his plea of guilty to criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree as a felony, due to his previous conviction of a crime, did not result in his conviction of a misdemeanor only; the failure was merely a procedural defect or irregularity which was waived by defendant's voluntary plea.

Inasmuch as a plea to a felony under the California burglary statute would not in all cases be a plea to a felony in New York, since the statutes do not match, the California conviction cannot be so considered; similarly, the California grand theft statute under which defendant was convicted provided that the value of the property stolen must exceed $ 200 and under New York law, grand larceny, as a class E felony, occurs when the value of the stolen property exceeds $ 250; because a court cannot go behind the statute to which defendant pleaded this California conviction also cannot be considered a predicate felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, organizations concerned with low-to-moderate-income housing and racial integration, low-to-moderate-income and minority residents of a town, and taxpayers, sought review of an order from the Supreme Court, Suffolk County (New York), which awarded judgment to defendant town in an action challenging the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, organizations concerned with low-to-moderate-income housing and racial integration, low-to-moderate-income and minority residents of the town, and taxpayers, filed an action against the town and its officials, alleging that the town, through its zoning ordinances, policies, and practices, had prevented the development of sufficient housing to accommodate its steadily increasing low-to-moderate-income population. The trial court rejected plaintiffs' contentions in their entirety. On appeal, the court found that plaintiffs were unable to demonstrate that the ordinance in question failed to provide for a well-ordered plan for the community. The court further found that plaintiffs failed to prove that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it failed to facilitate the development of low-to-moderate-income housing. Finally, the court found that plaintiffs failed to prove a statutory violation of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3601 et seq., in the town's processing of applications to develop such housing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order awarding judgment to the town was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The doctrine articulated by the Court of Appeals in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Berenson v Town of New Castle</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (38 NY2d 102) does not impose a constitutional duty upon a municipality to exercise its zoning powers in order to facilitate the development of low-to-moderate-income or low-cost housing; that doctrine merely requires that a town allow for the construction of different types of housing in sufficient numbers for those people who want and can afford it.  Accordingly, the Town of Brookhaven's zoning ordinance meets the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Berenson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> test, since it allows for a wide variety of different types and densities of residential housing and provides a &quot;balanced and well ordered plan for the community&quot;; further, taking into account the number of housing units which the zoning ordinance makes possible and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the number of people who could conceivably be housed therein, the ordinance, on its face, has given more than adequate consideration to local and regional housing needs.  Although all housing other than single-family homes requires a special permit, the numbers of permit approvals for such construction are sufficient to show that the special permit procedure has not been employed as a ruse to prevent the construction of multifamily housing in the Town of Brookhaven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The actions taken by defendant Town of Brookhaven with regard to various applications to develop Federally subsidized multiple-family housing for low-to-moderate-income families did not constitute a violation of the Federal Fair Housing Act (42 USC &sect; 3601 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.) which would entitle plaintiffs to the relief they seek, i.e., in addition to rezoning and other related relief, that the town be ordered to commence an affirmative action program to assist developers in obtaining government subsidies to insure the construction of integrated housing. Although 61.2% of the town's black school population was, at the time in issue, located in two communities which contained only&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  11% of the town's white population, there were also significant numbers of blacks in other areas of the town; further, while town officials, with popular support, made every effort to exclude low-to-moderate-income housing, there is no direct evidence of any racial motivation on their part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The special permit application procedures for the establishment of multifamily housing and mobile home communities within defendant Town of Brookhaven are not unconstitutional; although the rigidity of the application process, together with the low and steadily declining rate of approvals is, at least, a contributing cause of the declining rate of applications under the &quot;MF&quot; provisions of the Brookhaven zoning ordinance, plaintiffs have not succeeded in overcoming the presumption of this procedure's constitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt, especially since the town has proffered reasons in support thereof which, if not compelling, are, at least rational.  Moreover, on the issue of causation, plaintiffs have failed to refute defendants' contention that economic conditions beyond the town's control are at least equally responsible for the present&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  situation and that, other factors remaining equal, premapping of land within the town for multifamily usage would not significantly increase the supply of such housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The multifamily provisions of the zoning ordinance of defendant Town of Brookhaven, which require additional area for units with extra bedrooms, are not improper; defendants proffered a rational explanation for this rule, since more bedrooms mean more residents and increased population requires increased area.  In addition, defendants have demonstrated a rational basis for their 50-acre minimum site area and large recreational area requirements in mobile home communities, and have overcome plaintiffs' further attack upon the town's failure to zone any significant amount of vacant land for any single-family residences on smaller than one third of an acre lots by pointing to the large amount of vacant residential acreage. Finally, plaintiffs' challenge to the alleged practice of imposing covenants, e.g., limiting the number of two-bedroom units in multifamily developments to 20% of the total and requiring that all of the units in &quot;cluster&quot; developments be sold as condominiums&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rather than rented, must be rejected in the context of the present challenge to the facial validity of the Brookhaven ordinance under the standard articulated in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Berenson v Town of New Castle</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (38 NY2d 102). </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff retired superior police officers sought to enjoin enforcement of a provision of New York City's administrative code, which concerned the police department's pension fund. Defendants were the city and the pension fund's officers. The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association (PBA) intervened in the action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The code provision established a formula by which certain investment earnings of the pension fund were to be transferred to and allocated between a fund for superior officers and a fund for patrolmen. The PBA had intervened in support of the position of the city and the pension fund officials in the suit, which challenged the provision as violative of the state constitution, as well as an unconstitutional denial of equal protection. The court rejected the claims, and so reversed the denial of summary judgment for the city and the pension fund officials and for the PBA. The court held that the provision did not impair the benefits of the pension contract relationship in that the retired officers could not show that they received less than the full amounts of their retirement allowances. Therefore, the provision did not violate the state constitution. As to the equal protection claim, the court held that the code section, subject only to a rational basis analysis, accomplished the legitimate objective of providing larger supplements to the group with the greater need--the patrolmen-- and, therefore, did not deny the superior officers equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, except to the extent that it is required to pay interest on members' accumulated contributions (Administrative Code &sect; B18-29.0), the Pension Fund is not required by any provision of the statutory pension contract to pay investment earnings to its members.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

The allocation formula of section B18-27.1 (d) (1) classifies benefits not merely on the basis of rank, but, also, on need; the Legislature could rationally and reasonably find that retired patrolmen, who, on the average, receive smaller service retirement allowances than retired superior officers, have greater need for the larger supplemental payments than retired superior officers; a statute which allocates larger monetary benefits to those with greater need does not violate the equal protection clause because such a classification is rationally related to a legitimate State interest.  </SPAN></P>

The lower court had granted the motions to dismiss filed by several defendants, but not appellants. On appeal, the court concluded that appellants were entitled to dismissal of the citizens' action. The court held that the citizens lacked standing to interpose themselves and the courts into the management and operation of the public library as there was no claim of unconstitutionality or other clear illegality and as the citizens were not within a zone of interest protected by legislation. The court found that the Commissioner of Education of the State of New York had the authority to oversee the functioning of the library system and to determine whether a staff member of the library must have met specific qualification or if those requirements were waivable.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the decision of the lower court and denied the state tax commissioner's motion to dismiss. The court held that the notices of determination and demand for payment of taxes due were dated December 29, 1982, and, accordingly, in the absence of any hint of fraud, there could not be any assessment of taxes for periods ending three years prior to that date unless no return therefor was filed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 301(a), a petroleum business was taxed the sum of 3 1/4 percent of its gross receipts from sales of petroleum where shipments were made to points within the state, for the privilege of doing business in state. The court maintained that before a state tax could be held to violate the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const., art I, &sect; 8(3), on discrimination grounds, a plaintiff was required to show that it was discriminatory in favor of local business entities in purpose or effect. The court noted that the refinery did not cite any evidence that the purpose of &sect; 301(a) was to discourage or otherwise penalize interstate petroleum suppliers. The court also noted that the legislative history and wording of the statute clearly dispelled such a purpose. The court found that the tax itself was fairly apportioned to intrastate activities, as its incidence was dependent upon delivery to the purchaser in state. Therefore, the court concluded the tax was constitutionally imposed, irrespective of whether the transportation of the fuel itself from its originating point to its ultimate destination entailed crossing state borders.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">1983 N.Y. Laws 1018 changed how excess school taxes were to have been refunded. If a nuclear power plant in the county were to get its assessment reduced, the school district in which the plant was located would have been responsible for refunding the school taxes paid as a result of the initial over-assessment. Plaintiffs' declaratory judgment action sought to have 1983 N.Y. Laws 1018 declared unconstitutional. The complaint was dismissed on defendants' motion because they lacked standing, the complaint failed to state a cause of action, and the proceeding was premature. The court affirmed the dismissal, but for different reasons. The court found that the board of education lacked standing, but that while the taxpayers lacked standing under the state finance law, they had standing under the common law. However, the court held that the taxpayers' complaint did not present a justiciable controversy because the future event was beyond the control of the parties and might never have occurred. The court noted that dismissal of the complaint was not on the merits; consequently, the dismissal did not bar a subsequent action for the same relief if there ever was an actual controversy.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the mayor validly exercised his charter powers under the federal and state constitutions because agencies, which stood in the shoes of the state, were not permitted to prohibit the employment of individuals on the basis of personal proclivities which had nothing to do with whether they were able to perform the job adequately. The mayor was obligated to enforce those rights under his oath of office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's motion for leave to appeal an order of the trial court was granted. The court held that the proper procedure for determining ineffective assistance of appellate counsel was through a motion to vacate the judgment pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.10. In reaching this conclusion, the court held that defendant was constitutionally entitled to effective assistance of counsel on any appeal that could be taken as of right. The court held that a broad reading of &sect; 440.10(1)(h), which authorized the vacatur of a judgment obtained in violation of a right of the defendant under the constitution of the state or of the United States, encompassed ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims concerning representation in intermediate appellate courts. According to the court, in determining whether appellate counsel was effective, the trial court passed not on the court's decision, but only on the conduct of the counsel who presented the appeal on a new record established in an evidentiary hearing, a record not before the reviewing court on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

Although the alleged error could have been asserted at the time of the original appeal, CPL 440.10 (2) (c) is not a bar; it is not the alleged error alone, but an unjustified, unconstitutional failure of appellate counsel to raise the claim, that calls for relief; inasmuch as a judgment of conviction is reviewable as of right at the intermediate appellate court level, a broad reading of CPL 440.10 (1) (h) would encompass ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims concerning representation in intermediate appellate courts.

The appellate court found that defendant could raise no arguably meritorious challenge to the conduct of his trial. Defendant then made application to vacate the judgment, contending that he was denied effective assistance of appellate counsel. The trial court held that nisi prius was an improper forum for the review of the effectiveness of appellate counsel. Defendant sought reargument or leave to appeal. The court found that the trial court did not pass on the merits of the claim, and remitted the case to give the trial court the opportunity to do so.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant refused a plea bargain and he was convicted, the state requested that the trial court impose a sentence within the range of 15 years to life as authorized by N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.00(3)(a)(i). Defendant maintained that in view of his minor criminal record, the nature of the offense, and the great disparity between the plea offer and the mandatory sentence, the statutory sentence would be unconstitutional as applied to him. The trial court agreed. Upon review, the court found that the crimes at issue were committed prior to the effective date of the amendment, which increased the amount of drugs necessary for a class A-I felony of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first-degree. Defendant was subject to the old sentencing scheme. Instead, the trial court found that his was a rare case where the narcotics statute, while otherwise valid, would have been unconstitutional as applied to him. The court found that defendant was a principal actor in an ongoing cocaine business, and his was not the sort of peripheral association with narcotics activity that provided extremely compelling circumstances for not applying the sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company provided gas, electric, and steam services to various customers. Its steam sales had been steadily declining to the point that the Department of Public Service recommended that the company review the economic feasibility of its steam system. In conjunction with its filing for increased gas and electric rates, the company requested an increase in steam rates. It later submitted its report regarding the practicality of its steam department to the Commission and all of its steam customers. The Commission later established a temporary steam rate increase of nine percent. It also granted additional rate relief sufficient to avoid a negative return on the common stock investment. The Commission then made permanent the temporary, noncompensatory rate, and permitted a revenue increase sufficient only to enable the company to recover its out-of-pocket expenses. The court confirmed the determination, by holding that N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law &sect; 85, suggested no absolute guarantee of steam rates that yielded a profit, and there was no error in the Commission's determination that the company's customers should not bear the burden of transforming its failing business into a success.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner deputy fire chiefs (deputies) challenged the judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), which dismissed the deputies' request for declaratory and injunctive relief which arose out of respondent personnel director's purported reclassification of the deputies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Although the title of chief of the fire department belonged in the competitive civil service class, the position had for years been filled by extended provisional appointments. The deputies unsuccessfully requested that a competitive promotional examination be slated. When the deputies sought declaratory relief, the personnel director reclassified all deputy chiefs to a new civil service title without necessity of another examination and provided that the duties of the office of the chief would be exercised by a permanent incumbent in the competitive civil service with a new title. The trial court held that the actions constituted managerial discretion but the court reversed, because the personnel actions violated N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 65, which limited the duration of provisional appointments, and N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 6, which required that appointments and promotions in civil service be made according to merit and fitness upon competitive examination. The personnel director's actions resulted in a reclassification of the title of chief of the department from the competitive to the noncompetitive class without compliance with N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Provisional appointments allowed by Civil Service Law &sect; 65 are subject to the mandatory requirements that an examination be ordered for any position held by provisional appointment for a period of one month and that the examination be held as soon as practicable in order to prevent the provisional appointment from continuing for a period in excess of nine months; an agency has no discretion to determine whether an examination will be ordered and conducted.  Thus, respondents violated the provisions of section 65 when they filled the title of Chief of the Fire Department of the City of New York by successive provisional appointments, one for nearly three years and the next for about two and one-half years; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  even if respondents were genuinely reevaluating the organizational structure within the Fire Department, and not simply endeavoring to evade the Civil Service Law, they were still not authorized to suspend compliance with the dictates of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Resolutions promulgated by respondent Personnel Director of the City of New York which would eliminate the need for a competitive examination to effect the promotion of any person having the title of Deputy Chief (Fire) to the position of Chief of the Department contravenes NY Constitution, art V, &sect; 6, which provides that appointments and promotions in the civil service be made according to merit and fitness based upon competitive examination, and Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 487a-9.0, which requires that promotions within the Fire Department be the result of &quot;seniority, meritorious service * * * and * * * competitive examination&quot;; respondents may not circumvent the legal imperatives merely by endeavoring to abolish a title and designate an employee in a subordinate position to perform its former duties.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In enacting, respectively, New York City Charter &sect; 494 and Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 487a-20.0, the State Legislature and the New York City Council have explicitly limited the Fire Commissioner's discretion in the selection of the Chief of the Department; thus, to the extent that resolutions promulgated by respondent Personnel Director of the City of New York represent an encroachment upon legislative authority by eliminating the Chief of the Department as a separate and independent entity and investing the Fire Commissioner with the power to designate and remove the Chief of the Department at will, the law is clear that if an office is created by statute or ordinance, it can only be abolished by statute or ordinance and not by resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- Classification -- Reclassification by Resolution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Resolutions purporting to reclassify civil service titles are invalid where they are not adopted in accordance with statutory requirements; thus, resolutions promulgated by respondent Personnel Director of the City of New York, which maintain the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  position of Deputy Chief (Fire) as a tenured, competitive civil service title but direct that appointment to the Chief of the Department detail will be made from among the Deputy Chief (Fire) incumbents solely by designation of the Fire Commissioner and will serve at his pleasure, are invalid. In effect, such actions have resulted in a reclassification of the title of Chief of the Department from the competitive to the noncompetitive, or exempt, class without compliance with the procedural prescriptions outlined in Civil Service Law &sect; 20 and New York City Charter &sect; 1105; no notice, no hearings, and no review or approval by the State Civil Service Commission either preceded or followed the promulgation of the resolutions.  Moreover, City Charter &sect; 1105 (g), in conjunction with Civil Service Law &sect; 20 (1), do not exempt respondents from the procedural mandates contained in section 20.  </SPAN></P>

The court dismissed the newspaper's petition for a writ of prohibition. The newspaper could have obtained the jurors' identities at the voir dire proceedings. Also, there was a dispute whether the judge issued any orders regarding the non-disclosure of the jurors' names and addresses or non-disclosure of the court minute books. Until the factual issue was determined, the petition was improper. Neither the commissioner nor the trial court clerks were obligated to orally provide the names and addresses of the jurors. Also, the newspaper was not entitled to the answers to the potential jurors' questionnaires because they had confidential information. To the extent that the newspaper sought access to public records and minute books, a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, N.Y. C.P.L.R. &sect; 7803(1), proceeding against the commissioner and trial court clerks in the supreme court, special term, in the nature of mandamus was the proper vehicle to obtain this relief.</SPAN></P>

In a CPLR article 78 proceeding wherein petitioner newspaper publisher seeks a judgment vacating and prohibiting enforcement of alleged oral orders of respondent Administrative Judge which prevent respondent County Commissioner of Jurors and others from disclosing to the public and media the identities of jurors selected to hear criminal charges in Onondaga County, petitioner's right to access to criminal trials has not been unconstitutionally restrained nor does the failure to provide the information it seeks constitute a form of closure of trial proceedings; even assuming the existence of the oral orders, there is no doubt that the entire criminal proceedings, including the voir dire, are open to the public; any newspaper reporter attending the voir dire proceeding could ascertain the identity of the jurors.</SPAN></P>

Thus, to the extent that petitioner seeks access to public records and minute books, an article 78 proceeding in the nature of mandamus is the proper vehicle to endeavor to obtain such relief against respondent Commissioner and the court clerks ( CPLR 7803 [1]), and such proceeding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  must properly be brought in Supreme Court, Special Term ( CPLR 7804 [b]), not in the Appellate Division in the first instance.</SPAN></P>

The storage company asserted a cross claim against defendant landlords for moving and storage charges.

The landlords appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the tenant was evicted from the premises owned by the landlords, its equipment was placed in the premises of the storage company. The equipment was ultimately sold at public auction. The landlords argued that the moving and storage charges were due to the storage company's conduct in canceling a scheduled public auction. The storage company asserted that the sale was canceled due to the tenant's claim of ownership of the goods and questions as to the constitutionality of the statute permitting an ex parte sale of bailed goods. The landlords were notified of the cancellation of the warehousemen's lien sale and advised that such cancellation had no effect on their right to conduct a sale as judgment creditor. The court agreed with the storage company and held that the parties' writings contradicted any contention that the landlords were liable only for the original three-month storage fee. The storage company had no obligation to sell the goods at any specific time to satisfy the warehouseman's lien or to mitigate damages. The bailment contract, which was terminable at will, was a continuing contract until it was terminated and was not a contract only for a reasonable time.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, where plaintiff commercial tenant was evicted from defendant landlords' premises and plaintiff's equipment was removed by defendant moving company and placed in the warehouse of defendant storage company, remaining there until nearly four years later when it was sold at public auction and purchased by defendant moving and storage companies, Special Term properly granted defendant moving and storage companies summary judgment on their cross claim against defendant landlords for storage charges at the monthly rate agreed to in the storage contract for a period of 47 months; however, since there was no agreement as to late charges, an assessment is required as to those charges and also as to six moving charges which are unexplained. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Department approved applicant's request for a permit to build a single-family, two-story house. Neighbors discovered that toilets and bathtubs were being placed on all floors, that the building was three stories, and that partitions for separate entrances were being built. Department revoked applicant's permit. Applicant filed two sets of amended plants, which were both rejected. Finally, applicant submitted an amended plant that removed several bathtubs and toilets. Department advised applicant that the amended plans were acceptable, but applicant did not apply for a new permit. In annulling the revocation of the permit and the approval of the amended plan, the trial court held that applicant had a vested right to complete the building, as he had performed substantial work in good-faith reliance upon the legally issued permit. The court held that the trial court erred in annulling the revocation, as even though the building was substantially constructed at the time the permit was revoked, it was not the same building as that which had appeared in the permit application.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant's conviction for aggravated harassment (Penal Law &sect; 240.30), arising out of his distribution of offensive and vexatious printed material with intent to harass and annoy the complainant, is reversed; the harassment statute does not appear to have been relied upon as the basis for punishing any but annoying and harassing communications transmitted directly to the complainant and was not designed to prevent dissemination of such material.  Moreover, the statute is vague, at least as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  applied to defendant, since it is not clear what is meant by communication &quot;in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm&quot; to another; on the face of the statute it would be difficult for one to know that criminal sanctions were applicable to the distribution of the instant material, which accused the complainant of homosexuality and of sharp or dishonest dealing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Standing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A defendant, who was convicted of aggravated harassment based on his distributing of offensive and vexatious printed material accusing complainant of homosexuality and sharp or dishonest dealing, has standing to challenge the harassment statute (Penal Law &sect; 240.30) for overbreadth since the distinct possibility exists that the statute might again be similarly applied in the future, thereby forcing others to refrain from engaging in constitutionally protected speech or expression; defendant's conviction violated his 1st Amendment rights in that he was punished for exercising his right to free speech. It cannot be said that such State interest as there may be in protecting individuals against criticism of their sexual habits or financial dealings can justify&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  prosecuting defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Vexatious and Offensive Material</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A statute drawn in so narrow a form as to criminally punish one who describes another as a homosexual or as one who engages in sharp or dishonest dealing (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Penal Law &sect; 240.30), is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, at least as applied to defendant who was charged with distributing vexatious and offensive material which was neither obscene nor otherwise unprotected by the 1st Amendment (the &quot;fighting words&quot; exception, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Chaplinsky v New Hampshire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 315 U.S. 586, being inapplicable since the distribution was neither a violent nor a potentially violent act); the statute was so vague and indefinite, in form and as interpreted, as to permit within the scope of its language the punishment of incidents fairly within the protection of the guarantee of free speech, and, consequently, is void on its face, as contrary to the 14th Amendment.  The fact that certain modes of expression may be &quot;annoying&quot; to others does not require an individual to forfeit his 1st Amendment rights to make those expressions.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under the New York franchise tax scheme, the formula for computing the alternative minimum tax was not the same for savings banks as for commercial banks. The bank, which was a savings bank, brought an action against the commission to challenge the way in which it was taxed. The trial court granted a summary judgment for the commission, which the court affirmed. The court held that, because of the differences between the types of banks, one tax formula was unable to produce an equitable tax for both. The attributes justifying different tax treatment were that commercial banks continued to show a net profit and thus paid the basic tax, while savings banks had actually shown a net loss. Savings banks remained mutual institutions that handled savings accounts and provided money for long-term residential real estate mortgages. Commercial banks, conversely, derived a much lower proportionate share of their revenue from such sources and paid out a much smaller proportion of interest. The franchise tax scheme did not violate N.Y. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 4 because the two types of banks did not exercise substantially similar functions or engage in substantially similar business.</SPAN></P>

The different alternative minimum franchise tax treatment accorded savings banks and commercial banks pursuant to the classification set forth in Tax Law &sect; 1455 (b), wherein the alternative minimum for savings banks is based on a percentage of interest or dividends credited to depositors or shareholders, while the minimum for commercial banks is based on an assessment of an institution's par value of stock, does not violate the State Constitution since the different treatment has a rational basis&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and achieves the legislative goal of imposing a tax for the privilege of doing business in the State as a corporate entity.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- Retirement and Pension Benefits -- Suspension of Benefits during Public Reemployment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff, who retired from the New York City Police Department in July 1962, was not entitled to pension benefits he received from the New York City Police Pension Fund during the period that he was employed as a faculty member of the State University of New York (SUNY).  Plaintiff's membership in the Teachers' Retirement System, which predated the enactment of Retirement and Social Security Law article 7 in 1964, is protected by the NY Constitution, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  article V, &sect; 7 and cannot be impaired by Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 213, which prohibits a public retiree who is reemployed pursuant to article 7 from becoming a member of a public retirement system; however, since Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 211, which extends to public pensioners the privilege to undertake limited public employment without affecting their retirement allowances, and section 213 cannot be considered separate and apart from one another and since section 213 cannot be applied to plaintiff, plaintiff may not take advantage of the privilege established by section 211.  Accordingly, pursuant to Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 214, plaintiff was not entitled to the benefits received from the Police Pension Fund since 1962; section 214 provides that a retired person may be similarly employed during the effective period of article 7 subject to the same conditions and limitations as were applicable to his employment pursuant to the statutes under which he was originally employed; plaintiff's employment by SUNY in 1962 was subject to Civil Service Law (former) &sect;&sect; 150, 151, under which plaintiff was not entitled to receive such benefits during his&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  employment with SUNY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- Retirement and Pension Benefits -- Suspension of Benefits during Public Reemployment -- Due Process -- Equal Protection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The due process rights of plaintiff, who retired from the New York City Police Department in 1962 and was not entitled to pension benefits he received from the New York City Police Pension Fund during the period that he was employed as a faculty member of the State University of New York (SUNY), were not violated by the actions of the Police Pension Fund in notifying plaintiff by letter that his pension benefits would be suspended, that benefits received since 1962 would have to be repaid, and that he had 10 days to challenge the repayment calculation.  Plaintiff's entitlement to continued receipt of pension benefits from the pension fund is something less than an unrestricted property right subject to the full panoply of due process protections; the pension fund's letter met the minimum requirements of notice and an opportunity to be heard; inasmuch as no factual dispute existed, plaintiff was not entitled to a full hearing.  Moreover, plaintiff's assertions that he was denied equal protection since public pensioners&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  who undertake private employment are not subject to the same statutory conditions and limitations as those who return to public employment are inadequate to overcome the dual presumption of constitutionality and that the Legislature investigated and found such facts as were necessary to support the legislation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Generally, the doctrine of estoppel is not applicable to agencies of the State acting in a governmental capacity; accordingly, where plaintiff, who retired from the New York City Police Department in 1962, was not entitled to pension benefits he received from the New York City Police Pension Fund during the period that he was employed as a faculty member of the State University of New York (SUNY), the Police Pension Fund should not be estopped from terminating plaintiff's benefits and seeking to recover benefits paid since 1962 because it knew or should have known of plaintiff's reemployment with SUNY.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, apartment company and others (apartment company), appealed from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Dutchess County (New York), which favored defendants, the town and others (town), and dismissed the proceeding challenging Town of Stanford, N.Y., Local Law No. 2 (1982).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1977, the town, which had no zoning ordinance, enacted a moratorium law which prohibited multifamily dwellings and industrial and commercial establishments, except upon a variance issued by the town board on recommendation by the planning board. Each succeeding year, the moratorium law was reenacted. It remained in effect in 1982 when the apartment company made their application for a variance. The town argued that progress had been in the adoption of a comprehensive zoning plan, including the adoption of a master plan in 1980, and the completion of a preliminary draft of a zoning ordinance in December 1983 (one month after the apartment company's application for a variance was denied). However, the court found the justifications asserted for the delay were without merit. It held that the stop-gap legislation had been in effect for an excessive amount of time without the enactment of a comprehensive zoning ordinance, and that the limitation upon the use of property was unconstitutional and void. Thus, it reversed the judgment, and found the local law ultra vires and void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment in favor of the town was reversed, judgment was granted in favor of the apartment company declaring the temporary local zoning law ultra vires and void, and the town was directed to issue the permit applied for by the apartment company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant claimants sought review of the order of the Court of Claims (New York), which held that the highest and best use of claimants' properties was recreational, agreeing with the opinion of respondent state's appraiser that residential development was not economically feasible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The central issue on appeal was the proper valuation of property classified as wetlands taken in condemnation where the claim was made that the wetlands restrictions were, themselves, confiscatory. The claimants argued that the court of claims' finding as to the effect of the Tidal Wetlands Act was erroneous in that the properties had to be valued without regard to the Act if they had a reasonable economic use; and that the court erred in finding that zoning changes were required before the properties could have been residentially developed. The court did not agree with claimants that differences in size, access and zoning among the subject parcels necessitated a different per acre market value for each. The court accepted the court of claims' finding of a $ 3,000 per acre market value for some parcels as accurately representing their market value, at the time of taking, as a result of regulation by the Tidal Wetlands Act. For the remainder of the parcels, the court found that the claimants did establish that development was economically feasible and that a successful court challenge to application of the Tidal Wetlands Act as confiscatory was reasonably probable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Property taken in condemnation must be valued as legally restricted in use by all zoning and environmental&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  regulations in effect on the date of taking; if a claimant believes that application of the Tidal Wetlands Act ( ECL, art 25) unconstitutionally deprives him of any reasonable economic return on his property, he may challenge its validity in the condemnation proceeding by demonstrating that no permit would have issued for any economically productive use and that application of the Act, coupled with the denial of a permit, destroyed the property's economic value; however, the law accords no retroactive effect to an evidentiary showing that claimant would probably have succeeded in securing a judicial declaration of unconstitutionality had he challenged the denial of a permit.  Accordingly, in an action involving the valuation of property classified as wetlands taken in condemnation, where the claim is made that the wetlands restrictions are, themselves, confiscatory, the Court of Claims did not err in its statement that difficulties in securing approval for residential development under local and State tidal wetlands regulations would reduce the desirability of the properties in the marketplace; that claimants might eventually have secured a judicial declaration of confiscation, compelling&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the State to compensate them for their loss if a permit was denied, cannot be translated into a market value for immediate residential use on the date of taking.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action involving the proper valuation of property classified as wetlands taken in condemnation, where it is claimed that the wetlands restrictions are, themselves, confiscatory, it was error to find that residential development of two properties was not economically feasible. Even assuming the necessity of a sewage treatment plant for the proposed condominium units on the properties, the State's appraiser's conclusion that development costs would thereby become prohibitive is unsupported; there is a strong demand for residential property in the village where the properties are located, high prices are being paid therefor and the properties are subject to premium high density zoning; thus, but for the strictures of the Tidal Wetlands Act ( ECL, art 25), development would have been economically feasible, and the highest and best use of the properties was therefore residential, not recreational.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In an action involving the proper valuation of property classified as wetlands taken in condemnation, where it is claimed that the wetlands restrictions are, themselves, confiscatory, the Court of Claims went contrary to the weight of the evidence when it found residential development of one parcel of property to be economically unfeasible; the development costs proffered by claimants are supported by the testimony of an engineer with prior experience in developing property of a similar nature; the huge development costs proffered by the State are totally arbitrary.  The State had neither an engineering survey of the property, test borings, nor land use regulations to support its thesis; the State's failure to buttress its position with engineering testimony renders its conclusion entirely unconvincing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In an action involving the proper valuation of property classified as wetlands taken in condemnation, where it is claimed that the wetlands restrictions are, themselves, confiscatory, claimants have&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  failed to carry their burden of proof as to the economic feasibility of developing certain parcels of property, each of which is less than 300 feet in width and landlocked but for a one-rod right-of-way, in light of the county's requirement that septic tanks be set back 150 feet from tidal wetlands. Each parcel could never meet that requirement, treated in isolation, because the adjoining parcels would remain tidal wetlands; the costs of the development which would constitute a permissible use under the Tidal Wetlands Act ( ECL, art 25) would be prohibitive if the Act was fully applicable and claimants did not share the cost of improvements common to all; even if all the parcels could be treated as one and/or the setback regulation ignored, and assuming all claimants would have sought to develop their properties at the same time, the claimants' estimated costs and the development cost adjustment to their comparable sales are unrealistically low.  Moreover, sales of property which essentially encircles the subject parcels, although showing a relatively large appreciation in land values, do not support claimants' case; said property is not comparable to claimants' parcels since the lots&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are not dependent on a right-of-way for access and are located on upland, not wetland.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In an action involving the proper valuation of property classified as wetlands taken in condemnation, where it is claimed that the wetlands restrictions are, themselves, confiscatory, the correct measure of the market value at the time of taking is the value of the property as legally restricted in use by the Tidal Wetlands Act ( ECL, art 25) and any other pertinent environmental regulations in effect on the date of taking; accordingly, the Court of Claims properly found a $ 3,000 per acre market value for the subject parcels at the time of taking as a result of regulation by the Tidal Wetlands Act; differences in size, access and zoning among the subject parcels do not necessitate a different per acre market value for each.  As to the subject parcels for which residential development was not economically feasible, the wetlands' regulations are not confiscatory and, thus, the court's finding as to market value, as restricted, is conclusive.</SPAN></P>

In an action involving the proper valuation of property classified as wetlands taken in condemnation, where it is claimed that the wetlands restrictions are, themselves, confiscatory, in regard to the subject parcels as to which a comparison of market values with and without regard to the developmental restrictions of the Tidal Wetlands Act ( ECL, art 25) demonstrates that application of the Act has effectively deprived those claimants of all financially rewarding uses of their property, a constitutional challenge to application of the Act as confiscatory would have a reasonable probability of success; accordingly, those claimants are entitled to an incremental award, over and above the property's restricted market value, representing its enhanced value to a knowledgeable buyer in light of the reasonable probability of a successful constitutional challenge.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. In an action involving the proper valuation of property classified as wetlands taken in condemnation, where it is claimed that the wetlands restrictions are, themselves, confiscatory, it was not error to totally&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  disregard a prior arm's length sale of one of the subject parcels as the best comparable for purposes of determining market value on the day of taking.  Although generally, the price of a prior arm's length sale of property is, prima facie, an excellent indicator of its value at that time, the prior sale of the subject parcel in 1968 is of little value in determining the market value of the property in 1979, the time of taking; it has no bearing on the market value of the property as restricted by the Tidal Wetlands Act ( ECL, art 25) since the Act did not exist at the time of the sale; nor would it appear to have much relevance in connection with the incremental award to be made upon remand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent Domain -- Compensation -- Tidal Wetlands -- Feasibility of Development</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. In an action involving the proper valuation of property classified as wetlands taken in condemnation, where it is claimed that the wetlands restrictions are, themselves, confiscatory, topographic maps of property which was very similar to one of the subject parcels should have been allowed into evidence on the issue of the economic feasibility of development; since the material was not offered as direct&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  evidence of market value via comparable sales, distant location would not be a disability; to the extent that said maps could aid in determining what would be necessary physically to develop the subject parcel and what the cost might be, they would be relevant and helpful.  </SPAN></P>

The court ruled that although petitioners were clearly entitled to insert printed materials in the billing envelopes that expressed their views, no corresponding duty existed on the part of the government or the ratepayers to bear the cost burdens necessary to realize that right.

Further, the PSC is empowered to consider the &quot;nonutility&quot; use of assets, including a utility plant or the nature of company expenditures, and to take appropriate rate-making action to ensure that ratepayers are not compelled to pay for the cost of such activities or expenditures; finally, the cost allocation formula adopted by the PSC is not an unreasonable means of treating costs and should be upheld as proper application of its technical expertise and judgmental powers.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was incarcerated when it was alleged that he had extorted money from fellow inmates and was indicted. Defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to the minimum sentence authorized by N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.06. The court affirmed his conviction and sentence because the evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant had extorted money from fellow inmates. The court stated that defendant's claim, raised for the first time on appeal, that the sentencing statute was unconstitutional as applied to him and that under the circumstances the mandatory minimum authorized sentence of three to six years was cruel and unusual punishment, was not preserved for review. The court found that there were no exceptional circumstances to support such a claim. The court noted that because defendant's moving papers did not make a prima facie showing of some compelling factor, consideration, or circumstance clearly demonstrating that his prosecution and conviction were unjust, there was no legal basis for dismissal of the indictment in the furtherance of justice, and it was not error for the court to deny defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment without having conducted a hearing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's contention that the persistent violent felony offender statute was unconstitutional was also not preserved for review, and in any case identical arguments had been made and rejected in connection with the second felony offender statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant mall challenged the decision of the Supreme Court, Special Term, Suffolk County (New York), which (1) denied its motion for summary judgment, and (2) granted a cross motion by plaintiff organization for summary judgment. The trial court held that association's members had a right under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 8, 9 to communicate their ideas in the mall.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue to be decided was whether the rights of free speech and petition, N.Y. Const. art I, &sect;&sect; 8 and 9, protected association's members who wished to distribute leaflets dealing with matters of public interest and concern at a large, privately owned suburban shopping mall. The court concluded that the mall, by virtue of its size, location, and mode of operation, had undertaken the character and attributes of a downtown business district or town center. Thus, the rights of free expression under &sect;&sect; 8 and 9 required that the mall be enjoined from prohibiting the distribution of leaflets on its premises, subject only to the adoption of reasonable regulations as to the time, place, and manner in which such activities may be carried out so as to minimize any interference with the mall's commercial functions. The mall was a property which had to make an accommodation to the exercise of free speech by the general public, in this case expression with respect to the sharply debated but vitally important issues of nuclear power and nuclear weaponry. Full expression of ideas in those areas was not only desirable but was to be encouraged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order and judgment was affirmed, with costs payable by the mall.

Although leafleting at a privately owned shopping center, regardless of its size or character, is not a protected activity under the US Constitution, 1st Amendment, there is no Federal constitutional bar to a State according its citizens the right to engage in expressive activity in such a shopping center; such activity breaches neither the property rights nor the 1st Amendment rights of the owner of the shopping center. </SPAN></P>

Finally, defendant claimed that his sentence was unduly harsh and excessive. The court affirmed the trial court's convictions and sentences of defendant. The court held that because defendant failed to withdraw his pleas on the grounds that he was not properly advised by the trial court of his rights during his plea allocution, consistent with N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.10, he waived those claims for appellate review. The court also held that his sentence was appropriate and not unduly harsh.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The laboratories were billed for laboratory inspection and reference fees by the department on a sliding-scale fee schedule. The laboratories filed actions for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that N.Y. Pub.

The trial court granted the first laboratory's injunction, granted both laboratories' motions for discovery, and denied all parties' motions for summary judgment. The actions were consolidated, all parties appealed, and the court modified both judgments, granting in part the department's motions for summary judgment. The court held that the legislature had the right to recover the cost of a regulatory program prior to those costs being incurred as long as the fee schedule was based upon ever-changing estimated costs, and as such, &sect; 576(4) was constitutional. The court concluded, however, that because the fee schedule was not properly promulgated and filed, it was ineffective regardless of any knowledge the laboratories had of it because the department could not retroactively benefit from an amended regulation not in effect at the time of billing.</SPAN></P>

There is no unconstitutional delegation of lawmaking authority where the statute is unambiguous as to what power is being conferred, there being no prior action by the Legislature indicating an intent to retain authority to fix fees, where the fee schedule must be established so as to recover no more than the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">reasonable</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> estimated costs of operating the program, and where the fee charged to each individual laboratory must be reasonable and equitably allocated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff waste producer challenged an order and judgment from the Supreme Court at Special Term, Orange County (New York), which dismissed its complaint as barred by the statute of limitations found in N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The town and a sewage-works corporation entered into a stipulation of settlement that set the rates to be charged to a waste producer for a three-year period. The waste producer commenced an action seeking a judgment declaring the stipulation of settlement and the town's resolution approving the settlement violative of &sect; 121 and seeking a judgment declaring that fair, reasonable, and adequate rates be set. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground that it was barred by the four-month statute of limitations. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal. The court held that the challenged action was administrative in nature, not legislative. Therefore, the challenged action was reviewable in a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding, for which a four-month time limitation was prescribed by N.Y. C.P.L.R. 217. The factors that led the court to conclude that the challenged action was administrative rather than legislative were that the action was addressed to individualized rates established for the waste producer, the stipulation covered a specified time period, and the action challenged was taken informally by means of stipulation and resolution, not by legislative enactment.</SPAN></P>

The fact that the action was taken pursuant to a statute, which did not require notice or a hearing, is of no legal significance in light of those factors found to be characteristic of administrative action, viz., individualized application, limited duration and informal adoption.  </SPAN></P>

A complaint against defendant New York State Racing and Wagering Board challenging the 1982 Board rules governing the administration of drugs prior to race time and alleging that the Board exceeded its statutory authority and usurped powers vested in the Board of Regents by attempting to regulate the practice of veterinary medicine, should be dismissed; pursuant to section 301&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (subd 2, par b) of the Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law, the Board is empowered to prescribe rules and regulations in order to prevent &quot;the use of improper devices, the administration of drugs or stimulants or other improper acts for the purpose of affecting the speed&quot; of the horses about to participate in races.  The 1982 rules do not prohibit a licensed veterinarian from administering a drug necessary for the life or health of a horse and the decision to prescribe a drug is left with the veterinarian.</SPAN></P>

The regulations were established based upon the advice of the Board's expert and in response to the demands of the racing industry and under the circumstances, the court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Board where the Board determined that the clearance time of drugs in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a horse's urine is related to the drug's effect upon a horse's performance in a race.

Sections 4012.1 (d) and 4120.5 (d) of the New York State Racing and Wagering Board's regulations (9 NYCRR 4012.1 [d]; 4120.5 [d]) which provide for track inspections of licensed veterinarians to insure compliance with and deter evasion of the Board's prohibition against possession of hypodermic equipment and controlled substances do not deprive racetrack veterinarians of their constitutional right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and do not amount to an impermissible delegation of authority by the Board.  The Board, having promulgated regulations, is empowered to attach certain conditions to licenses issued to equine veterinarians in order effectively to implement those regulations.

The court on appeal held that there was neither a constitutional nor statutory obligation mandating the pretrial disclosure of the identity of a prosecution witness. Defendant did not present any special circumstances for the disclosure, and the decision to disallow it was discretionary with the trial court. The court also found that &sect; 205.25 was not constitutionally vague because it was sufficiently explicit to inform a reasonable man of the nature of the offense prohibited. The court held that defendant failed to overcome the presumption of the statute's constitutional validity.

The father argued that the first order was entered after the expiration of the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother was designated as an agent of a Michigan &quot;public welfare official&quot; and brought an action against the father to establish paternity more than five years after the birth of the child. The father argued that the paternity proceeding was actually brought by the mother on her own behalf, thus the two-year statute of limitations applied and the order was improperly issued. The court first held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the father leave to amend his answer to assert the statute of limitations defense. However, even if the issue had been timely raise, the court held that the paternity proceeding was properly viewed as one originated by a public welfare official and was timely under the 10-year statute of limitations applicable thereto as provided under N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 517(b). The mother was a long-term recipient of public assistance and the State of Michigan had an interest in seeking to establish paternity in order to relieve itself of any continuing financial burden. Contrary to the father's contention, there was no attempt to perpetrate a fraud on either him or the court. According, the order establishing paternity was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

In any event, since the petition was submitted with a sworn statement by a representative of the Michigan Department of Social Services authorizing petitioner, who was receiving Aid to Dependent Children funds from the State of Michigan, to act as its agent for the purpose of pursuing child support from respondent, the instant paternity proceeding is properly viewed as one originated by a public welfare official and, therefore, it is timely under the 10-year Statute of Limitations applicable to paternity proceedings commenced by such officials (Family Ct Act, &sect; 517, subd [b]); the State of Michigan Department of Social Services is a &quot;public welfare official&quot; for purposes of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  statute (Family Ct Act, &sect;&sect; 517, 522) and the designation of petitioner mother as the agent of the Michigan Department of Social Services was proper.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a paternity proceeding in which the Family Court declared respondent to be the father of petitioner's child, the court should have proceeded to determine as well the issue of support, within the same proceeding (Family Ct Act, &sect; 545); however, the court declined to do so because petitioner was an out-of-State resident, and a support proceeding could be commenced by her in her home State under the Uniform Support of Dependents Law, thereby obviating the need for her to remain in New York.  Accordingly, notwithstanding that the orders of filiation and support were the result of two distinct proceedings, the order of filiation is nonetheless reviewable upon an appeal from the support order, as it would be if the support order had been issued in the paternity proceeding; moreover, even if such review were not available, the Appellate Division would exercise its discretion to grant leave to appeal from the order of filiation (Family Ct Act, &sect; 1112).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Supreme Court, Nassau County (New York), held invalid a building zone restriction of defendant town prohibiting occupancy of single-family dwellings by two persons unrelated to each other by blood, marriage, or adoption. Plaintiff property owners and the town cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The town enacted a zoning restriction that, with a limited exception for two persons 62 years of age or over, restricted occupancy of one-family homes to persons related by blood, marriage, or adoption. The property owners rented their home to four unrelated young men. The town building inspector instituted criminal proceedings against the property owners under the zoning restriction. The property owners and their tenants responded with a suit against the town, its supervisor, and building inspector. The lower court held that the restriction violated state equal protection rights and a state human rights law. In affirming the judgment on other grounds, the court held that (1) because the human rights law prohibited discrimination based on marital status and not occupancy by unrelated persons, it was inapplicable, and (2) the zoning restriction was fatally unconstitutional because it violated the due process clause of the N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment holding the ordinance invalid, as modified, was affirmed. The court ordered that the judgment be modified by adding a declaration that the restriction was unconstitutional insofar as it prohibited two or more persons unrelated by blood, marriage, or adoption from living together, by adding a provision that it violated due process under the state constitution, and by enjoining enforcement of the restriction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A town zoning ordinance which, with a limited exception for two persons 62 years of age and over, restricts occupancy of one-family homes to persons related by blood, marriage or adoption is so arbitrary and fatally overbroad that it violates the due process clause of the State Constitution (NY Const, art I, &sect; 6).  The instant ordinance exceeds the original purpose of &quot;single-family&quot; designations in zoning ordinances, i.e., to control types of housing and living and not the genetic or intimate internal family relations of human beings, and conclusively presumes that occupancy by persons unrelated by blood, marriage or adoption is inimical to the general welfare; while there is a legitimate local interest in preventing overcrowding and traffic congestion, restricting single household composition to related persons is not a means reasonably related to the ends sought since, in the absence of a presumption of investigation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and knowledge by the municipal authorities and of evidence to support the municipality's position, the conclusive presumption that unrelated people, who join to share companionship and costs as a single housekeeping unit in one-family homes, disrupt their neighborhoods and create other problems cannot be accepted on the instant record.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A zoning ordinance which, with a limited exception for two persons 62 years of age or over, restricts occupancy of one-family homes to persons related by blood, marriage or adoption, does not conflict with subdivision 5 of section 296 of the Executive Law, since a restriction against occupancy by persons who have no familial relationship does not constitute illegal discrimination based on &quot;marital status&quot; under the statute; moreover, the proof adduced at trial was insufficient to sustain a finding that the ordinance constituted exclusionary zoning, where plaintiffs failed to make the requisite factual demonstration as to regional needs or that the ordinance was enacted with an exclusionary purpose.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that the suspension was proper because it was supported by sufficient evidence. Because U.S. Const. amend. XXI allowed for states to regulate alcoholic beverages, the state had the authority to regulate the establishments that served alcohol. Therefore, the prohibitions under &sect; 53.1(r)(1) were proper. N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 was not violated by the prohibition of nude dancing, though it did prohibit bans on topless dancing in establishments that served liquor. The term &quot;lewd and indecent&quot; was not vague because it was synonymous with &quot;obscene.&quot; Thus, N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 9, &sect; 53.1(r)(1) was specific enough to show what was prohibited. The Authority had the power to determine whether the performance in the holder's establishment was lewd and indecent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant governor and others sought review of a decision by the Supreme Court at Special Term in Albany County (New York), which, on the application of respondent party chairman, declared an executive order regarding voter registration unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The governor issued an executive order, which established a program to encourage voter registration and created a &quot;Voter Registration Task Force.&quot; The party chairman brought an action to have the executive order declared unconstitutional. The court at special term held that the executive order was unconstitutional and enjoined implementation of the governor's program. The governor appealed and the court reversed. The court found that the executive order did not violate the state constitution's mandate that voter registration be conducted in a bipartisan manner. The court said that order merely provided a means to make registration forms available to the public and that the party chairman offered no proof that the order violated the bipartisan mandate. The court also held that the order did not violate the separation of powers doctrine. The court noted that the state constitution charged the legislature with the duty of creating a voter registration system. The executive order did not infringe on that duty, the court said, because it did not create a new system of registration. Instead, the order merely used the existing system previously outlined by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Executive Order No. 43, which directs State agencies which have regular business contacts with the public to conduct voter registration projects to assist citizens of the State in registering to vote and creates a &quot;Voter Registration Task Force&quot; to develop training programs for State employees involved in the voter registration effort, does not violate section 8 of article II of the New York Constitution because it does not create a board &quot;charged with the duty of registration&quot;.

Executive Order No. 43, which directs State agencies which have regular business contacts with the public to conduct voter registration projects to assist citizens of the State in registering to vote and creates a &quot;Voter Registration Task Force&quot; to develop training programs for State employees involved in the voter registration effort, is not unconstitutional as violating the separation of powers doctrine. The Legislature has explicitly declared a public policy in favor of the broadest voter participation in elections as well as the widest distribution possible of mail registration applications; the executive order does not create a new system of registration, which is clearly the responsibility of the Legislature (NY Const, art II, &sect; 6), but merely uses the existing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  system outlined by the Legislature in the Election Law. Therefore, the executive order does not seek to create a State-wide program for voter registration and enrollment in political parties, nor does it infringe on any power explicitly delegated to the Legislature in the State Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The provision of receptacles for completed voter registration forms at those State agency locations where the forms are made available under the authority of Executive Order No. 43 is enjoined; in carrying out the passive objective of the executive order of making voter registration forms more available and accessible to the public, State agency personnel should not handle completed forms; the completed forms should be mailed directly to the local board of elections. However, signs displayed at the various State agencies which are enlarged copies of mail registration forms and contain the notation &quot;To vote in a primary election, you must register in a party&quot; cannot be construed as uncontroverted evidence that assistance is offered in the enrollment process.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the Board's motion for summary judgment. The court reversed because the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint as time barred. A declaratory judgment action is normally governed by a six-year statute of limitations period. However, where the action could have been brought as a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, a four-month limitations period applies. A proceeding under art. 78 was not the proper alternate form of judicial proceeding that was open to the teacher because the proceeding was not available to challenge a legislative act. The Board's denial of the teacher's request for a salary credit on the basis of the by-law was a legislative act. The label applied because the dispute centered upon a rule of general applicability rather than an ad hoc determination of an individual party's particular rights. The teacher's case could have been brought as an art. 78 proceeding and, therefore, the six-year rather than the four-year limitations period applied, rendering the action timely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers ran a large-volume retailer and wholesale distributor of electronic home entertainment equipment. The Commission determined that the sale of televisions to a third party was a retail sale subject to sales tax, and because the taxpayers failed to collect sales tax, they were liable for it. The taxpayers claimed that the record did not support the conclusion that the sale was a retail transaction. The court disagreed, holding that under N.Y. Tax Law &sect;&sect; 1101(b)(4)(i), 1105(a), the disputed transaction fell within the definition of retail sales subject to sales tax. The purchaser did not deliver a certificate showing the purchase was for resale, so the taxpayers were liable for the tax under N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1132(c). The court also rejected the taxpayers' claim that the transaction was not a taxable event because the televisions were delivered to a carrier in New York but were destined for an out-of-state purchaser. The evidence demonstrated that the agreement for the sale of the televisions was finalized in New York, payments were received in New York and, most importantly, the taxpayers made arrangements with the carrier to pick up the televisions in New York.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs commenced this action against the city and its local development corporation seeking, inter alia, a judgment declaring unconstitutional the state statute and the city ordinance authorizing participation in a federal loan program, under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (Act), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 5301 et seq., to assist in financing the construction of a downtown hotel. The court held that plaintiffs failed to overcome the strong presumption of constitutionality of state statutes. The court noted that plaintiffs failed to show an extension of municipal funds or credit to the private developers. The court found that the city's participation was intended to promote urban expansion and growth to attract investments and create permanent job opportunities for low and moderate income persons. The court saw no gift or loan of municipal funds in violation of the state constitution. The court opined that the federal statute did not require the city to guarantee the loan by pledging its full faith and credit, so the required security was limited to future federal grants under the Act and proceeds from foreclosure sale of the property. The order was affirmed as modified.</SPAN></P>

The court found that during the relevant tax years, the commission's regulation specifically excluded short-term notes from the term &quot;other securities&quot; in &sect; 208(5). Although the regulation was later amended to include short-term notes in the definition of &quot;other securities,&quot; the court held that the commission was bound by its regulation that was in effect during the relevant tax period.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The question presented on appeal was whether the Erie County Tax Act (the Act), which did not require personal notice to mortgagees prior to in rem tax foreclosure, was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, which set aside the tax foreclosure sale. The court found that the Act provided inadequate notice to satisfy due process requirements. The court noted that where a property interest was at stake, a party had to be afforded that degree of notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections. The court determined that the Erie County statutes would only be exacerbated by the recent trend in which many noninstitutional lenders, particularly private persons who engaged in seller financing, financed real estate transactions. The court concluded that the state had a constitutional duty to provide notice to persons before divesting them of their property and that that constitutional duty could not be met by shifting the burden to the property owner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In this declaratory judgment action the property owner challenged the constitutionality of N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 305, and art. 19 of the Real Property Tax Law and appealed from the grant of summary judgment to the city declaring the legislative enactments valid and constitutional. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 305 was not void for vagueness for failure to mandate a specific fractional assessment so long as the fraction could be easily ascertained. The court held that there was no due process requirement that fractional assessment of property had to be uniform statewide. The court held that the classification of property as homestead and nonhomestead was permissible and that the legislature was free to delegate to local assessing units the power to impose heavier burdens on nonhomestead property than had existed historically. The court also held that in light of the state's traditional reliance on local assessing units to administer the property tax system, art. 19 did not deny any property owner equal protection of the law in the allocation of county taxes.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Assessment -- Fractional Assessment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 305 of the Real Property Tax Law, which provides that &quot;All real property in each assessing unit shall be assessed at a uniform percentage of value&quot;, is not unconstitutionally vague; &quot;value&quot; as used in the statute means market value. Furthermore, since all property within an assessment unit must be uniformly assessed at a common percentage of full value, which in the City of Rochester has been publicly declared to be 100%, the statute is reasonably definite on its face and, in any event, it is valid as applied to plaintiff, the owner of a four-family dwelling in that city; there is no due process requirement that fractional assessment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  must be uniform State-wide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Assessment -- Homestead and Nonhomestead Property Classes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The statutory formula in article 19 of the Real Property Tax Law for establishing the homestead base proportion based on the assessment roll for the year prior to revaluation is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to local assessors. The Legislature did not delegate to local assessors the power to establish class tax rates; rather, it determined for itself to adopt the historical tax burdens for each class of homestead and nonhomestead property as reflected in the assessment roll as a starting point for the establishment of future tax rates, which decision had a rational basis wholly apart from the assessors' role in creating the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> classification of property into residential and commercial classes which article 19 was enacted to preserve.  In addition, article 19 delegates to local legislative bodies, not to the assessors, the discretion to adopt that article and, further, to adjust the proportion of taxes paid by each class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Assessment -- Homestead and Nonhomestead Property Classes</SPAN></P>

The legislative purpose in enacting article 19, i.e., to preserve the assessing unit as the primary political jurisdiction for the assessment of property and the allocation of property taxes, has a rational basis; the promotion of local control of taxation is a legitimate State interest and one to which the present system is reasonably related and, moreover, preserving the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">status quo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by avoiding a sudden shift of the real property tax burden from commercial to residential property is a legitimate basis for legislative action and supports the validity of article 19.  </SPAN></P>

The property, however, was subject to the Tidal Wetlands Act, N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law art. 25. Thus, the tenant applied to the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) for appropriate permits and any necessary variances to allow him to a dwelling and a septic tank system on the property. The application was denied, and the tenant sought review. The court confirmed the Commissioner's decision but remanded the case to the special term court for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the regulations at issue constituted an unconstitutional taking of the tenant's property. The DEC's evidence provided substantial evidence for the denial of the applications. However, pursuant to prior case law on the issue, an evidentiary hearing was required in order to determine whether the DEC's denial of such permits constituted an unconstitutional taking of the tenant's property. Since this matter was transferred to the court under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, it did not have before it a proper evidentiary record on the confiscation issue.</SPAN></P>

In future proceedings authorized by ECL 25-0404, absent unusual circumstances, Special Term should determine, in the first instance, whether the denial of the permit should be sustained, and if the answer to that question is affirmative, whether a confiscation hearing is warranted; it would then hold such a hearing and render a determination on the confiscation question and, should there be an appeal, the appellate court would have the benefit of those initial findings and determinations.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A special franchise was a right to maintain systems that transported, through public areas, water, steam, gas, or electricity. The SBEA taxed special franchise property using an equalization rate. By a 1982 amendment, N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 744(1) (1982) provided that the equalization rate was the sole evidence of equality with regard to assessment. As to due process, because special franchises were different from other real property, the state was permitted to enact the amendment as a procedural means to ensure equal ratio assessment between special franchise property and other property. As to equal protection, the amendment was rationally related to preserving equality and uniformity in taxation. Retroactive application of the amendment did not deprive persons of rights that earlier existed under the statute. The court's ruling prior to the amendment that &sect; 744 allowed a challenge to the equalization rate was only an interpretation of &sect; 744 that was determined incorrect by the amendment. Article 7 of the Real Property Tax Law was the exclusive procedure for reviewing real property tax assessment. N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 was unavailable to challenge the equalization rates.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 1 of section 744 of the Real Property Tax Law, which precludes a special franchise holder from judicially contesting equalization rates, is constitutional; the Real Property Tax Law permits administrative review of tentative special franchise assessments and thus the administrative contesting of the equalization rate, and allows a challenge to the equalization rate in the event that the incorrect equalization rate or one which is not the latest rate has been applied.  Since the Legislature has&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  determined that the best procedural means by which its policy of equal ratio assessment between special franchises and other real property can be effectuated is by strict reliance on the equalization rate, and has not eliminated petitioner's right to judicial review generally, petitioner's due process rights have not been violated; subdivision 1 of section 744 is rationally related to the objective of equality and uniformity of taxation and there is no transgression of petitioner's equal protection rights.  The fact that the equalization rates will be exclusive evidence of the issue of equality with regard to assessments of special franchises does not amount to a delegation of legislative power, and the State Board of Equalization and Assessment has not been delegated any power to set tax rates; there is no violation of section 2 of article XVI of the New York Constitution because the statute does not mandate that any particular equalization rate be set, and if the application of an equalization rate results in an assessment in excess of full value, the taxpayer could raise the point by way of an overvaluation cause of action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2. The Legislature's action in making the amendment to subdivision 1 of section 744 of the Real Property Tax Law, which precludes a special franchise holder from judicially contesting equalization rates, retroactive in order to supersede a prior decision of the Appellate Division, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers; the amendment did not deprive petitioner of any cause of action or substantive right granted to it by the Appellate Division since there had not yet been any determination that the equalization rates were inaccurate and the court simply held that petitioner had a right to contest the equalization rates as a matter of statutory interpretation. Courts are obligated to apply retroactive modifications of the laws involved in pending litigation, and no final determination had been made at the time the Legislature amended the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Assessment -- Judicial Review</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Article 7 of the Real Property Tax Law is the exclusive procedure for review of real property assessments unless otherwise provided by law, and no other provision in the Real Property Tax Law gives a special franchise holder the right&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to review equalization rates by way of a CPLR article 78 proceeding; thus, petitioner cannot use an article 78 proceeding to challenge the accuracy of the equalization rates.  Although petitioner's application to declare the 1982 amendment to subdivision 1 of section 744 of the Real Property Tax Law precluding a special franchise holder from judicially contesting equalization rates unconstitutional could have been the subject of a separate article 78 proceeding, petitioner chose to make such claim the subject of a cross motion in a proceeding pursuant to article 7 and has had a full opportunity to litigate its contentions in this regard; thus, no purpose would have been served by converting the proceeding into a CPLR article 78 proceeding.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A community council filed an action against the governor challenging the constitutionality of 1982 N.Y. Laws 455, which apportioned and distributed the state senate and assembly districts. The council appealed the declaration that the law was valid. The court affirmed because 1982 N.Y. Laws 455 complied with N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 5. The contiguous districts with connected territory were compact and contiguous because they were subject to the equality of population requirement and were intended to maintain the voting power of minority groups in a county that lost districts by the census and to avoid a total population deviation in excess of 10 percent. The law did not invidiously discriminate against a political group or impermissibly impair voting powers in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, which prevailed over the inconsistent provisions of the state constitution requiring the joining of certain counties. The court held that the council's claim that 1982 N.Y. Laws 455 was a partisan gerrymander was non-justiciable and the council failed to submit sufficient evidence of partisan intent.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs refused to comply with the orders, resulting in the suspension and subsequent revocation of their licenses. Plaintiffs appealed, claiming that the inspections violated their U.S. Const. amend. IV protections against warrantless searches and seizures and the agency agreed. Defendant appealed and the court reversed, holding that an ex parte warrant or subpoena was not a necessary condition precedent to an administrative inspection. The court held that the administrative procedures provided more protection than a traditional search warrant, which was executed under the compulsion of the threat of force because if plaintiffs failed to comply, defendant's only recourse was to administrative and judicial process, providing plaintiffs with an adequate forum for judicial review.</SPAN></P>

Inasmuch as the inspections were limited to required records and the licensees' public areas, the statutory safeguards were sufficient to protect their legitimate privacy concerns.

Subsequently, the chairman filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. The special term granted the motion. Thereafter, defendants filed an appeal, thereby effecting an automatic stay of the special term's order. On appeal, the court held that the special term abused its discretion in finding that the chairman demonstrated that he would suffer irreparable harm if defendants were not preliminary enjoined. In order to be entitled to a preliminary injunction, the chairman needed to show a likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable injury to him if the relief was not granted, and a balancing of the equities in his favor.

On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the trial court erred in valuing the property as if the Tidal Wetlands Act had been successfully directly attacked prior to the date of taking. The trial court should have valued the property as restricted by the Tidal Wetlands Act, with an increment for the reasonable probability of a successful judicial challenge to the statute's application as confiscatory. The court concluded that the probability-incremental increase rule applied; thus, the property should have been valued as if the Tidal Wetlands Act was in effect with an incremental increase representing the premium that a knowledgeable buyer would have paid for a potential change to a more valuable use.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order of the Broome County Court (New York), entering judgment of conviction of rape in the first degree and sodomy in the first degree, and resentencing defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was under suspicion of having committed sexual crimes. The arresting officer learned that defendant had been previously charged with burglary. The record, however, did not reflect that he had been convicted and sentenced and was still represented by counsel upon an appeal. After giving defendant Miranda warnings, which were waived, the police took his oral and written confessions that he committed rape and sodomy. The lower court convicted defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed. The burglary appeal was not a criminal action because the burglary conviction and sentence had terminated the action, under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 1.20(16). Because the action had terminated, his waiver of the right to counsel outside of the presence of counsel was effective. The failure of the police to ask about representation was not fatal to the waiver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgments of conviction; defendant's waiver of counsel outside of the presence of counsel was constitutional because the appeal of his prior conviction was not considered a criminal action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A judgment convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of rape and sodomy is affirmed; while the police were aware that defendant had been charged in an unrelated burglary matter, the records did not indicate any disposition of the charge although in fact defendant had pleaded guilty to the charge and an appeal, in connection with which defendant was represented by counsel, was pending; the failure of the police to inquire into defendant's representation in regard to his appeal did not preclude his waiver of counsel when he received his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings, and defendant's statements were thus not taken from him in violation of his right to counsel; an appeal and the attorney assigned to prosecute it are not part of a pending criminal action or charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A defendant who pleaded&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  guilty to rape and sodomy and negotiated a plea agreement whereby he would receive 7 1/2 to 15 years for each crime, the sentences to run concurrently, if a prior burglary conviction that was then on appeal was affirmed and 7 1/2 to 22 1/2 years if the burglary conviction were reversed, was properly resentenced to 7 1/2 to 22 1/2 years on each charge after the judgment of conviction for the burglary was reversed; the sentence originally imposed was the agreed-upon term for defendant as a second felony offender, and when the predicate felony conviction was reversed, the court had inherent power to vacate the sentence and impose a sentence upon defendant as a first offender. The sentence imposed was within the statutory limits and defendant was fully apprised before his plea of what his sentence would be if his appeal were successful; having voluntarily accepted a sentence less than the statutory maximum, defendant cannot now complain that his sentence was illegal or unduly severe.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant town challenged a judgment by the Supreme Court, Nassau County (New York), which declared its zoning ordinance requiring those seniors who wanted to purchase a condominium in a senior citizens residence district to first reside in the town for at least one year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The local ordinance required residency in the town for at least one year before senior citizens could purchase a condominium in the newly developed senior residence district. A nonresident citizen challenged the ordinance. The trial court declared the durational residency requirement invalid and unconstitutional on equal protection grounds. On appeal, the court agreed that the requirement was invalid and unconstitutional, but on different grounds. The court held that the local zoning ordinance was invalid because it placed an impermissible restraint upon the users or owners of the property and because it also had an exclusionary purpose and impact. The court found no rational relationship among the durational residency requirement and the goal of providing appropriate and affordable housing for senior citizens.</SPAN></P>

Further, said one-year durational residency requirement reflects an exclusionary purpose and has an exclusionary impact when coupled with a failure to consider the housing needs of senior citizens in the surrounding region, which are at least as great as those within the town.  Accordingly, a judgment declaring said ordinance invalid and unconstitutional is affirmed.  </SPAN></P>

The lessee appealed, arguing that recreational dancing was a form of speech protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and that the New York City Zoning Resolution's prohibition of recreational dancing infringed upon freedom of speech. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, holding that recreational dancing was not a form of speech protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The First Amendment protected dancing of a performer, paid or otherwise, presented for the entertainment of the public because it contained some element of communicating or advancing ideas, the court explained.

A citizen-taxpayer does not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the issuance of State bond anticipation notes under subdivision 1 of section 123-b, which grants a citizen-taxpayer standing with respect to State expenditures but does not apply to revenue raising; there is a clear legislative intent to prevent taxpayer challenges in such cases.</SPAN></P>

Further, debts, whether contingent or fixed, paid out of current appropriations in the State's general fund, replenished by the collection of taxes and which are necessary for the ongoing business of State government, are not subject to a challenge under section 11 of article VII of the State Constitution for failure to submit the question to a referendum at a general election; courts may not invalidate policy decisions of the Legislature enacted into law out of a mere preference for a different or more restrained approach.  </SPAN></P>

No appeal was taken. Later that year, &sect; 517 was amended to extend the limitations period to five years from the child's birth. In light of the amendment, the mother filed a new paternity petition. The putative father's motion to dismiss the second petition was denied. The court reversed the judgment and held, first, that the amendment was to have been retroactively applied. The extension of the limitations period to five years was calculated to cure the statute of its perceived constitutional infirmity. Remedial legislation was generally afforded retrospective treatment. However, res judicata prohibited consideration of the second petition. The precise issue decided in the first proceeding was that the mother was precluded by the statute of limitations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff merchants challenged the judgment from the Supreme Court at Special Term, Suffolk County (New York), which declared County of Suffolk, N.Y., Local Law No. 42-1981 and Town of Islip, N.Y., Local Law No. 4 (1981), preempted by state legislation. They filed an action against defendant county to declare both laws, which forbade the sale of merchandise characterized as drug paraphernalia, unconstitutional and unenforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The merchants owned and operated retail establishments. They claimed that state legislation was preemptive and that the local ordinances were void for vagueness and violated their rights of free speech, due process, and equal protection. The court initially directed the issuance of a preliminary injunction and a trial of the factual issues raised in the complaint against the county. However, a later judgment declared the local ordinances to be preempted by state legislation. The court held that: (1) although the county and the town had broad powers to enact local legislation concerning the health, safety, welfare, and morals of their residents, pursuant to N.Y. Const. art IX, &sect; 2, and N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 10(1), they were precluded from adopting local laws that were preempted by state legislation; (2) the legislature evinced an intention to occupy the entire field of &quot;drug-related paraphernalia,&quot; marked by a pervasive scheme of state legislation; and (3) the local enactments expressly conflicted with the state legislation and their different standards, definitions, and penalties would lead to confused and inconsistent enforcement. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs appealed from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Westchester County (New York), which denied plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and granted defendant town's cross motion for summary judgment dismissing the action as premature upon the ground that plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. Plaintiffs had filed an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 to declare certain sections of the town's law unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs filed a cause of action against the town to have its Sign and Illumination Law and Gasoline Service Station Law unconstitutional. The trial court granted the town's cross-motion for summary judgment holding that plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. Reversing the trial court's judgment, the court noted that plaintiffs were not required to exhaust their administrative remedies by seeking variances before commencing the instant action. They were not claiming that the statutes in issue were creating a unique hardship for them. Rather than asking for the relaxation of an assumedly valid regulation, plaintiffs were asserting that they were entitled to a declaration of the unconstitutionality of the statutes because as applied to them the statutes improperly restricted their freedom of speech. Under these circumstances, the court held that they were entitled to make a direct attack upon these statutes. The court concluded that the restrictions on the dissemination of truthful commercial speech were violative of plaintiffs' rights under the U.S. Const. amend. I because they restricted speech solely on the basis of content.</SPAN></P>

Law &sect; 301(5), annulment of the order of respondent Board of Standards and Appeals of the City of New York (board), revoking the certificate of occupancy of the mortgaged building because of misrepresentations in an alteration permit application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a hearing on the application of the Buildings Commissioner, the board revoked the building's certificate of occupancy because it was issued on misrepresentations made in an application for an alteration permit. The application represented that the premises consisted of two buildings, each with a lot coverage of less than 5,000 square feet and therefore convertible, as of right, into loft dwellings under the zoning regulations. But the property was one building with a lot coverage of 12,472 and therefore not eligible for conversion. Reversing the decision, the court explained that the mortgagees were not entitled under N.Y. Mult. Dwell. Law &sect; 301(5) to notice of the hearing concerning continuation of the certificate of occupancy where the dwelling did not conform to all other applicable law. The court added that not only did the mortgagees have actual notice of the revocation proceeding, they participated in the hearings by submitting affidavits opposing the revocation. The court rejected the mortgagees' claims that they were denied their constitutionally protected due process right to notice and an opportunity to have been heard as without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers alleged over valuation, illegality, and inequality in the tax assessments on their real property and attempted to prove the inequality of the assessments with the &quot;justification&quot; requirement of a prior decision. They served notice on defendant town to admit ratio pursuant to N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 716. The town's response was that it denied to admit the ratio on the grounds that the town did not understand the taxpayers' demand to admit. The trial court held that the taxpayers failed to prove ratio and inequality. The court reversed and held that the evidence established the taxpayers' prima facie case that the use of the state rates was justified and that the taxpayers proved ratio and inequality. The town failed to meet its burden of proving that the state rates were inappropriate. The town's response to the taxpayers' demand for admissions did not comply with the provisions of N.Y.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In proceedings pursuant to article 7 of the Real Property Tax Law to review assessments for the years 1974 through 1978 on certain real property located in the Town of Haverstraw, which property is improved with buildings containing 390&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  single-family condominium dwelling units, petitioners have established ratio in their effort to prove inequality of their assessments, where they presented State Board of Equalization and Assessment (SBEA) certificates of State equalization rates for the years in question and SBEA backup materials for those years and this documentary evidence was supported by the testimony of the town's appraiser, the Town Attorney and the SBEA director of research and statistics.  In any event, the town's failure to &quot;specifically&quot; deny the ratios set forth in notices to admit ratio served by petitioners for the years 1974 through 1977 must be deemed an admission of the ratios set forth therein for those years (Real Property Tax Law, &sect; 716).  Accordingly, inasmuch as the town is not a special assessing unit with a population of one million or more and State equalization rates may therefore be used to prove inequality (Real Property Tax Law, &sect; 720, subd 3, as amd by L 1981, ch 1057, &sect; 7), petitioners must be deemed to have established ratio for the years 1974 through 1978 and are entitled to a determination by the trial court on the issue of the fair market value of the subject property. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant State Attorney General and plaintiff shop owners challenged the decision of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which held that N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law art. 39 was not impermissibly vague on its face, but, with respect to the sale and display of multiuse items, granted the shop owners' application for a preliminary injunction and directed a hearing to determine as to such items the constitutionality of article 39.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court agreed with the trial court that article 39 was not impermissibly vague and that a violation of article 39 occurred only if the violator was shown to have a culpable intent. As applied to retailers, possession of drug paraphernalia did not give rise to a violation unless the retailer intended to sell the drug paraphernalia to those who would use it in a prohibited manner. The court found no basis for the trial court's conclusion that a hearing was required prior to enforcement of the statute to determine the constitutionality of its application to one or another of the so-called multiple-use items that the shop owners possessed. The court held that the trial court correctly concluded that the omission of a specific requirement of probable cause in N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 852(2) was not reasonably interpreted as diluting the requirement that there be probable cause prior to any search or seizure undertaken pursuant to the subdivision. The court held that the omission from &sect; 852(2) of any right to at least a postseizure hearing prior to forfeiture violated the Due Process Clause of the Constitution. The court severed the invalid section from the rest of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The owner's argument was grounded on the fact that the assessment notice had the wrong taxable quarter listed as the assessment period and no assessment was proposed for the correct quarter; therefore, it contended, the assessment for the proper quarter was time-bared.

The SIF is not an individual or public or private corporation or association or private undertaking within the meaning of article VII (&sect; 8, subd 1); the SIF is itself a State agency and, therefore, the constitutional provision does&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not apply to it.</SPAN></P>

The provision for the annual appropriation of $ 190 million to insure the solvency of the SIF following the transfer of a like sum to the State's general fund cannot be equated with the incurring of long-term debt for capital improvement as proscribed by those constitutional provisions.  Moreover, chapter 55 and chapter 404 of the Laws of 1982, which provides for the first $ 190 million appropriation under chapter 55, do not create an appropriation scheme in violation of section 7 of article VII; if no appropriation is passed in any future year, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the amount appropriated for and encumbered during the preceding fiscal year is to be paid forthwith and, therefore, any moneys paid under any such appropriation must be paid, if at all, within two years next after the passage of such appropriation action within the mandate of section 7 of article VII.</SPAN></P>

The SIF funds are State funds and plaintiffs have no constitutionally protected property interests therein.  No such property rights derive from any promises or guarantees contained in the insurance policies or any provision of the Workers' Compensation Law; the insurance policies cannot be fairly interpreted as conferring any such contractual rights and the language of the applicable provisions of the Workers' Compensation Law is clearly permissive and does not evince a legislative intent to create private contractual or vested rights.</SPAN></P>

Inasmuch as plaintiffs were operating in a heavily regulated industry, they knew that their contractual rights were subject to alteration by legislative amendments and, therefore, their reasonable expectations have not been impaired; moreover, any impairment that might exist is not substantial since there is no evidence of any retroactive impact of the challenged legislation on any contract rights plaintiffs may possess nor does it appear that the SIF will raise its premiums as a result of said legislation.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that the statute's reclassification of prior felony convictions as violent felonies did not violate the restriction against ex post facto legislation because &sect; 70.08 imposed a more severe punishment for the latest crime for which an accused was sentenced but did not impose any additional penalty for the prior crimes. However, the court then held that the trial court erred in calculating defendant's prior felonies. In reaching its conclusion, the court held that two or more predicate violent felony convictions were required to be committed sequentially, so that the second offense, to be counted as a predicate, was required to be committed after sentencing of the first offense. Thus, the court held that the three prior convictions in which concurrent sentences were imposed within a three-month period were considered as only one prior offense. Thus, the court modified the judgment by vacating the sentence and remanding the case for sentencing of defendant as a second violent felony offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of forgery. Defendant appealed, arguing that the prosecution was precluded from submitting certain evidence because it failed to demonstrate the good cause necessary to excuse its failure to give the statutory notice of its intention to offer potentially suppressible evidence at trial within 15 days after arraignment as required by N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 710.30 (2). The court ruled that the statutory requirements could be dispensed with whenever the statute's goal, to afford defendant adequate time in preparing his case, was accomplished by some substitute procedure. The court held that the statutory goal of adequate preparation was accomplished since defendant was notified that the prosecution intended to offer suppressible evidence at a hearing two months prior to defendant's trial. Further, the court concluded that a photographic array was not unconstitutionally suggestive because defendant's contention of unconstitutionality was based on the fact that defendant's photograph had not been trimmed to fit in the police identification book, yet the witnesses did not recall noticing this difference when they made their identifications.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners initiated the art. 78 proceeding to enjoin the Department's use of certain expedited procedures to inspect pharmacies and assess penalties. Petitioners also sought a declaration that the procedures, as set forth in N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 65102)(c), were unconstitutional. The supreme court held that the expedited procedure was an unconstitutional deprivation of due process because a specific penalty was assessed before the licensee had an opportunity to appear before the relevant committee. The supreme court also directed the Department to issue warnings without penalties or giving notice of charges and reference to a committee panel. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment, analogizing the procedure to the criminal plea bargaining process. The letter constituted the charge and the acceptance of the proposed fine was, in effect, a plea of guilty. The court also held that the guilty plea properly was encouraged by offering benefits and that the Department did not exceed its authority under the statute.

The trial court dismissed the doctor's application to annul the department's refusal to license him to practice medicine in New York. The court affirmed. The reasons for the department's refusal to waive the doctor's conceded noncompliance with the regulation, including his failure to demonstrate that the doctorate in physics was equivalent to a year of medical school, the lack of accreditation of the Mexican medical school, and the failure of the Mexican school to respond to inquiries made by the department, afforded substantial evidence to support the determination which was not arbitrary or capricious.

Further, the court found that the public need requirement was applicable to the owner's facility because it applied to all hospitals, irrespective of the nature of their funding. Moreover, the formula utilized to predict public need was properly designed to provide flexibility between the levels of care provided by health-related facilities and skilled nursing facilities.

The PSC's decision to adopt a specific rate design proposed by the Consumer Protection Board in a reply brief did not deny petitioner its right to cross-examine or respond to such proposal; the decision of the PSC to reject a two-stage rate increase due to lack of a decremental cost study was not irrational or arbitrary and capricious. There is substantial evidence in the record to support the ultimate across-the-board rate increase arrived at by the PSC, and there is no requirement that the PSC accept the testimony of, or evidence presented by, any one particular witness, even if that witness is a member of the staff of the department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Utilities -- Rate Making -- Promotional Advertising Expenses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A decision of the Public Service Commission (PSC) to limit the allowance for promotional advertising expenses for petitioner, a utility which provides gas service, to .08% of revenues, or $ 751,000, rather than the $ 1.6 million requested by petitioner, is supported by substantial evidence; such a matter rests within the the discretion and expertise of the PSC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Utilities -- Promotional Advertising -- Disclaimer Requirement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  3. The Public Service Commission (PSC) has the statutory authority to require petitioner, a utility which provides gas service, in advertising based on the price advantage of natural gas, to include a disclaimer that any such advantage might dissipate as a result of deregulation and to provide a phone number to solicit further information, since subdivision 12-a of section 66 of the Public Service Law provides that the commission shall ensure periodic explanation of applicable rates and rate schedules for the purpose of assisting customers in making the most efficient use of energy. The disclaimer requirement did not infringe upon petitioner's constitutional right of expression, since the State has a substantial interest in requiring a utility to provide complete information to consumers if it chooses to advertise the price advantages of its service, the disclaimer directly advances that interest and it is specific and drawn to remedy the situation the PSC sought to correct; petitioner's equal protection rights were not violated because the disclaimer requirement was imposed upon only it and one other utility since government may move forward by gradual progression rather than by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  universal application or not at all, and petitioner's due process rights were not violated since it had the opportunity to present evidence regarding the disclaimer. Finally, the disclaimer requirement is not arbitrary, capricious or unsupported by the record.  </SPAN></P>

The parents and administrators of an estate had filed an identical suit against an official of the charitable organization in New Jersey. The New Jersey court found in favor of the official based on application of New Jersey's charitable immunity statute,&nbsp;&sect; 2A:53A-7. The charitable organization and its employee filed motions to dismiss this action on grounds of collateral estoppel and application of &sect; 2A:53A-7. The court found that much of the sexual abuse of the two boys took place in New Jersey as did the alleged wrongful hiring and supervision of the employee. Because New Jersey was the only state having any interest in the resolution of the case, &sect; 2A:53A-7 applied to bar the suit.

The trial court held, in its conclusions of law, that the police had not met their heavy burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt the voluntariness of defendant's alleged consent to the otherwise illegal search, but that suppression of the physical evidence was not warranted in view of the fact that the police believed in good faith the quality of the consent to be sufficient, this good faith was reasonable, and any error by the police was a mere judgmental error. Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence. The court affirmed the conviction and the denial of defendant's motion to suppress, holding that the state met its burden of establishing that defendant gave his consent to the search of the trunk because he was cooperative with all of the police officers' requests at the time he was stopped, he was never handcuffed, and he voluntarily opened the trunk for the officers to search.</SPAN></P>

However, the court concluded that a reversal on that basis was not required. Because the family court conducted a plenary hearing, the court was authorized to review the sufficiency of the order under the clear and convincing standard. The court held that the family court's finding that the mother failed to plan for the future of the children, was in and of itself, sufficient support for the determination of permanent neglect. The mother's poor financial situation did not prevent her from developing realistic and feasible plans for the children's future. Moreover, she abandoned the alcoholism treatment programs devised by the department.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, owners of an auto salvage business, were convicted of criminal possession of stolen property pursuant to the New York City Charter &sect; 436. Police officers surveyed defendants' salvage yard, not for the purposes of an administrative inspection but expressly to gather evidence of a crime and found certain parts that were obtained from stolen vehicles. Thereafter, the officers secured a search warrant. Defendants sought to suppress this evidence but, at trial, the court found that the initial stop was proper, that the warrantless search of the yard was sustainable as an administrative search under &sect;436 and that the search conducted pursuant to the warrant should be upheld. The issue concerned the construction of &sect;436, which authorized the police department to conduct warrantless administrative inspections of certain enterprises. On appeal, the court reversed and remitted, because the police officers expressly maintained that their mission was to gather evidence of a crime rather than to administer any regulatory scheme. When a search was not undertaken as a routine regulatory inspection, the administrative search rationale was simply inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

Section 1262-b enabled the county to recover an amount equal to the sales tax revenues returned to those cities by means of a county real property tax imposed in those cities. The property owners sought a determination that &sect; 1262-b was unconstitutional under N.Y. Const. art VIII, &sect; 10, a permanent injunction against its enforcement, and refunds. The trial court found &sect; 1262-b to be unconstitutional, but made the relief prospective by allowing the municipalities to continue to utilize &sect; 1262-b in their then-current budgets and denying refunds for taxes paid. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 1262-b conflicted with N.Y. Const. art VIII, &sect; 10, but deleted the portions of the order making the relief prospective and denying the tax refunds.

Petitioners objected to the creation of a zoning district in their original petition and, in an amended petition, sought to raise the issue of environmental quality review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an amended petition, petitioners alleged that the environmental quality review was legally insufficient for want of an environmental assessment form and by its allegedly incorrect conclusion with respect to the environmental impact of the district. On appeal, the court reversed the grant of the motion to amend the petition and to add new parties. The petition was governed by the four-month statute of limitations contained in N.Y. C.P.L.R. 217. Contrary to the trial court's decision, only an action seeking to declare a statute unconstitutional was cognizable after the four months has expired and an action could not be labeled as one for a declaratory judgment merely to avoid the limitations period. Further, the relation back provision in N.Y. C.P.L.R. 203(e) did not save petitioner's proposed environmental quality review challenge. Petitioners originally complained of the wisdom of the board's approval of the district and attacked the procedures for convening a public hearing before a community board. The agencies could not be said to have been put on notice thereby of errors in the environmental quality review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state moved under the common law and N.Y. Pub. Health Law tit. II, art. 23 to abate alleged nuisances that had been observed at the bookstore, which sold sexually explicit material. It also sought under N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2320 to close the store and seize its assets. The bookstore filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the statutory cause of action on the ground that the statute was inapplicable to its situation and unconstitutionally infringed on its First Amendment rights. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court affirmed because &sect; 2320, which defined the scope of tit. II, art. 23, placed no restriction on the premises subject to the law and was clearly aimed at prohibited conduct and not just houses of prostitution if the state by a preponderance of the evidence could establish that the premises were being used for a lewd purpose. Moreover, the bookstore's First Amendment rights were not threatened by the action because it was aimed at the prohibited conduct and not the content of the store's inventory.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Title II of article 23 of the Public Health Law, entitled &quot;Houses of Prostitution: Injunction and Abatement&quot;, is applicable to enjoin a nuisance in the form of lewd and illegal acts committed by patrons at a bookstore which sells books, magazines and novelties of a sexually frank nature and maintains coin-operated movie machines which show explicit sexual material; section 2320 of the Public Health Law defines the scope of the title and provides that whoever erects, establishes, or maintains a place used for the purpose of lewdness, assignation or prostitution is guilty of maintaining a nuisance and that the place where any such conduct occurs constitutes a nuisance and shall be enjoined and abated. A premises may have multiple purposes and if one of those is the promotion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of lewdness, assignation or prostitution, it will run afoul of the statute; if the statute were intended to apply exclusively to houses of prostitution such a broad definition would not have been given to the term &quot;nuisance&quot;, and the substance of a statute is to be determined by its provisions and not by its title.  While the People need not demonstrate that the sole, or even dominant, use of the premises is devoted to the illegality prohibited in the statute, the People will have to show by a preponderance of the evidence a consistent pattern of conduct sufficient to prove that the premises are being employed for a proscribed use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nuisance -- Lewd Behavior at Bookstore -- Mandatory Closure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The mandatory closure provisions of title II of article 23 of the Public Health Law, which provide for the enjoining and abatement of lewdness, assignation or prostitution occurring at premises, do not infringe upon the First Amendment freedoms of the owner and operator of a bookstore which sells books, magazines and novelties of a sexually frank nature and maintains coin-operated movie machines which show explicit sexual material, at which premises it is alleged that a nuisance in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the form of lewd and illegal acts committed by patrons is occurring. The statute is not required to contain any of the procedural safeguards mandated by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Freedman v Maryland</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (380 U.S. 51), nor would closure of the bookstore constitute a prior restraint on protected First Amendment speech since the purpose of an action to enjoin the conduct occurring at the bookstore is to enjoin illegal conduct and not to regulate the content of presumptively protected materials distributed by the bookstore, and since the conduct sought to be enjoined is not &quot;constitutionally preferred activity&quot; the overbreadth doctrine is inapplicable.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, city and city rent commissioner, sought review of a decision from the Supreme Court at Special Term in New York County (New York), which denied their summary judgment motion that sought dismissal of plaintiff landlord's complaint. The landlord alleged a prima facie tort asserting that the city and the commissioner had conspired intentionally to interfere with the landlord's business and to violate his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landlord alleged a prima facie tort and a violation of his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The city and the commissioner brought a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court denied. On appeal, the court reversed and held that &sect; 1983 authorized a civil action for damages or equitable relief, or both, to redress any deprivation of civil rights perpetrated against an individual under color of state law. The court found that there was no constitutional right to a rent compatibility hearing in establishing a maximum rent base for the landlord's apartments. The court determined the compatibility hearing to ascertain the rents generally prevailing in the same area for substantially similar housing was merely one procedure to be utilized in fixing the rent. The court ruled no cause of action pursuant to &sect; 1983 had been stated. The court held that the allegation of a prima facie tort was also with basis. The court held that the landlord had not demonstrated that the acts of the city and commissioner in denying rent increases sought by the landlord were motivated out of malice towards the landlord.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action in which it was alleged that defendants, the City of New York and various officials of the Department of Rent and Housing Maintenance, had maliciously and intentionally conspired to interfere with plaintiff's business and violate its constitutional rights to due process and equal protection, in connection with the determination of the maximum legal rent to an apartment in petitioner's building, the Supreme Court had no power to order defendants to comply with a prior order of the Supreme Court made in a CPLR article 78 proceeding directing defendants, in determining the maximum legal rent, to rely upon a comparability study to ascertain the rents generally&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  prevailing in the same area for substantially similar housing accommodations and to set a new maximum rent within 60 days, since the Appellate Division, in a subsequent article 78 proceeding, had reversed a Supreme Court order remanding the proceeding to hold the comparability study and remanded the subsequent proceeding to permit defendants to interpose an answer so that the issue of whether a comparability hearing had been held, or was viable or feasible, could be litigated; in the face of the Appellate Division's action, the alleged violation of the Supreme Court's order could provide no basis on which to found a collateral action, and the determination that there had been such violation was plainly premature, if not erroneous.</SPAN></P>

There are adequate State remedies to correct agency abuses such as violation of a court order, and at the time of the institution of the action and the Supreme Court's order appealed from, plaintiff had failed to pursue to completion its article 78 remedies; there has been no showing that the administrative and judicial procedure available to redress the alleged governmental misconduct is not adequate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In an action in which it was alleged that defendants, the City of New York and various officials of the Department&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Rent and Housing Maintenance, had maliciously and intentionally conspired to interfere with plaintiff's business and violate its constitutional rights to due process and equal protection, in connection with the alleged violation of a Supreme Court order directing defendants to hold a comparability study in order to determine the maximum legal rent for an apartment in petitioner's building, no cause of action for prima facie tort is stated; neither the complaint nor plaintiff's bill of particulars sufficiently itemizes special damages, and plaintiff has not demonstrated that defendants' acts in denying a rent increase were motivated out of malice toward plaintiff.  While defendants may have failed to comply with a court order, no evidence has been shown that such omission was an intentional wrong constituting tortious conduct.  Prima facie tort is not designed to provide a basis for collateral attack on an agency determination parallel with the judicial proceeding challenging such determination, or where contempt proceedings provide an adequate remedy.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission determined that the taxpayers owed sales and use taxes plus interest and penalties. The taxpayers filed an action pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 to review the Commission's determination. The Commission moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that the taxpayers had failed to either deposit the amount owed or to file an undertaking as required by N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1138(a)(4). The lower court conditionally granted the motion to dismiss unless the taxpayers filed an undertaking in an amount equal to the value of the estate of one of the taxpayers plus $ 1,000. Both sides appealed. The court rejected the taxpayers' argument that &sect; 1138(a)(4) was unconstitutional and that requiring them to pay before they litigated deprived them of due process. The Commission countered that &sect; 1138(a)(4) did not provide for a reduction in the amount to be deposited. The court held that &sect; 1138(a)(4) was constitutional, noting that the United States Supreme Court had ruled that the principle of pay first and litigate later was constitutionally permissible. The court held that the taxpayers' failure to deposit the required undertaking deprived the lower court of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the lower court judgment by deleting therefrom all of the decretal provisions except that which dismissed the taxpayers' petition to review the Commission's tax assessment. The court added a provision to the judgment declaring that the deposit and undertaking requirements of the Tax Law were constitutional. The court affirmed the decree as modified.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the lot owners had not acquired ownership of the trailer by virtue of having its value assessed against them, therefore ownership of the mobile home remained in the owner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, husband and wife, sought review of an order of the Supreme Court at Special Term in Suffolk County (New York), which granted a motion to dismiss by defendants, members of a singing group and their record company. The husband and wife alleged that comments made during a radio interview were defamatory. The lower court dismissed the complaint, holding that the husband and wife failed to allege special damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A husband and wife brought an action alleging defamation against a singing group, members of which made comments during a radio interview suggesting that the husband was homosexual. The husband and wife sought compensatory and punitive damages for humiliation, mental anguish, loss of reputation, and injury to their marital relationship as well as for the loss of customers, business opportunities, and good will allegedly suffered by the husband. The lower court dismissed their complaint, holding that they did not sufficiently plead the special damages necessary to sustain a slander action. The court found that the husband and wife were actually alleging libel because the alleged defamation was broadcast over the airwaves. The court noted that parties alleging libel did not have to plead special damages if the defamatory statement would expose the party to public contempt, ridicule, aversion or disgrace. The court found that the complaint of the husband and wife was actionable without proof of special damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order of the lower court. The singing group's motion to dismiss the complaint was denied, and the complaint of the husband and wife was reinstated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Libel and Slander -- Radio Broadcast -- Statements Made in Radio Interview</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an action brought by plaintiffs, husband and wife, against the members of a singing group, as individuals and against their record company, alleging that statements made by defendants in a radio interview that &quot;we used to fool around with his wife&quot; and &quot;I don't think it was his wife that he got upset about, I think it was when somebody started messing around with his boyfriend that he really freaked out&quot; were defamatory, defendants' motion to dismiss is denied and the complaint is reinstated; although plaintiffs' nonspecific conclusory allegations do not meet the stringent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  requirements imposed for pleading special damages, a plaintiff suing in libel need not plead or prove special damages if the defamatory statement tends to expose the plaintiff to public contempt, ridicule, aversion or disgrace, or induce an evil opinion of him.  Defamation which is broadcast by means of radio or television should be classified as libel and the statements, which could have been interpreted to mean that plaintiff wife was having an affair with one of the defendants, and as imputing homosexuality, are libelous on their face, thus obviating any need to allege and prove special damages. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant putative father challenged a decision of the Family Court, Suffolk County (New York), which denied the putative father's motion to vacate a demand that he submit to a blood-grouping test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The putative father contended that N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 532 (1981), which authorized the results of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) to be used as affirmative proof of paternity, violated due process, equal protection, and the putative father's privilege against self-incrimination. The putative father also contended that the proceeding was time-barred. The court held that &sect; 532 did not violate due process. According to the court, the probative value of admitting HLA test results outweighed any prejudicial effect of admitting such results. The court also held that &sect; 532 did not violate equal protection. According to the court, the legislature had a rational basis for failing to grant judicial discretion in ordering blood tests in paternity proceedings. Furthermore, the court held that &sect; 532 did not violate the privilege against self-incrimination because the blood test results were not testimonial in nature. Finally, the court held that the 10-year statute of limitations for paternity actions instituted by public welfare officials was constitutional. According to the court, the 10-year time period did not violate due process or equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, which denied the putative father's motion to vacate a demand that he submit to a blood-grouping test.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 532 of the Family Court Act, which provides that the results of a human leucocyte antigen (HLA) blood tissue test may be received in evidence to aid in the determination of whether the alleged father is or is not the father except where exclusion has already been established by other blood-grouping tests, does not deprive a putative father of his Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process of law and equal protection of the laws and his Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination. The HLA test can increase the probability of exclusion to such a high degree as to affirmatively prove paternity where a putative father is not excluded by the test&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  results, and the probative value of such a test result outweighs the danger of any undue prejudice; the recent amendment to section 418 of the Family Court Act permitting any party in a support proceeding to move for an order directing the mother, her child and the alleged father to submit to HLA tests has removed any disparity of treatment among a class of citizens similarly situated; although in a paternity proceeding section 532 requires the court to order blood tests upon motion of any party and in a support proceeding section 418 allows the court to exercise discretion in ordering such tests, there is a rational basis for conferring such discretion in support proceedings, in order to enable the court to protect children born during marriage from spurious claims of illegitimacy by a parent seeking to avoid the legal obligation to pay support; and finally, since blood test results are not testimonial in nature, the statutory privilege contained in section 531 of the Family Court Act is neither violated nor implicated by submitting to HLA testing.</SPAN></P>

The 10-year Statute of Limitations&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for commencement of a paternity proceeding where the petitioner is a public welfare official (Family Ct Act, &sect; 517) is not repugnant to either the due process clause or the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; the determination of the Legislature, in balancing a public welfare official's right to prosecute an otherwise valid filiation claim against the right of a putative father to be protected from defending a stale claim, that a period of limitation of 10 years after the birth of the child was appropriate, was not unreasonable or arbitrary in view of the strong public interest in protecting the community against burdensome taxation produced by the acts of individuals in derogation of public policy; the 1981 amendment to section 532 of the Family Court Act, which authorized the results of human leucocyte antigen testing to be used as affirmative proof of paternity, did not render unreasonable the original balance struck at the time of the enactment of section 517, and the interest in avoiding litigation of stale or fraudulent claims is outweighed by the need to provide the class of children born out of wedlock with a reasonable opportunity to institute paternity proceedings&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and to establish their right to support.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A defendant and his co-defendants were convicted of murder in the second degree. Defendant challenged the conviction because the trial court had erroneously denied his challenge for cause a venireman. The court agreed there was error. The court reversed defendant's conviction, and remanded for a new trial. The main issue on appeal was whether defendant's challenge for cause was preserved for appellate review when he did not exercise his preemptory challenge because his co-defendants refused to do so. The court found defendant's challenge for cause that he made pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 270.20 was not waived. The court reasoned that the challenge for cause did bring the issue to the attention of the trial judge in a manner that pinpointed the legal question, and did satisfy the primary consideration of preserving an error for review. However, the court did not extend such a holding to his co-defendants who did not join him in his challenge for cause. The court affirmed the co-defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The erroneous denial of a challenge for cause was preserved for review when the defendant who made the challenge was unable to exercise a peremptory challenge because his codefendants refused to join the exercise with him.  Although the verdicts convicting the three codefendants are not jurisdictionally defective by virtue of the presence of a juror who should have been disqualified on the ground that he had served on another jury&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  within the preceding two years (Judiciary Law, &sect; 511, subd 5), the verdict convicting the defendant who made the challenge and who attempted to exercise a peremptory challenge cannot stand and he is granted a new trial, since a majority of jointly tried defendants must exercise a peremptory challenge ( CPL 270.25, subd 3) and this defendant's attempt to exercise such a challenge, which failed because his codefendants refused to join with him, cannot be construed as an intent to waive his position; the failure to exclude a disqualified juror after a timely and adequate objection necessarily affects the verdict against him and cannot be considered harmless error.  The codefendants who made no objection to the venireman before he was sworn as a trial juror waived the issue of disqualification and cannot avail themselves of their colleague's objection.  </SPAN></P>
