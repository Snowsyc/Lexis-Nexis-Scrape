</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city created a historic district. The owner's properties, which were located within the historic district, had been in a state of decay since before the adoption of the historic district ordinance. The owner applied for a permit to demolish two vacant houses located on the properties. The city's historical architecture review board recommended denial of demolition permit, and the city council confirmed the recommendation. The owner appealed to the court, arguing that the denial of the demolition permit constitutes an unconstitutional taking of his property. The court denied the owner's appeal, holding that there was evidence to support a finding that the two buildings were historically significant. There was expert testimony that the two buildings were both architecturally noteworthy and historically valuable. The buildings were typical 19th century structures and were linked historically to other 19th century structures in the district. The court further held that the owner failed to establish that the denial of the demolition permit amounted to a taking of the property where the owner did not demonstrate that a sale of the properties was impossible or impractical.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the president of a volunteer fire department, was arrested and charged with violating Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 5512 and 5513, the gambling statutes of the Crimes Code of Pennsylvania. At the hearing on his omnibus pretrial motion, he admitted gambling on its premises. However, he contended that the statutes were unconstitutional under both the Pennsylvania and United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The power of the court was limited to the narrow issue of determining whether the state gambling laws passed constitutional muster. The president contended that both Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 5512 and 5513 were unconstitutionally vague. The court disagreed and found that there was no need for &quot;men of common intelligence&quot; to guess at the meaning of &quot;unlawful gambling.&quot; Therefore, &sect;&sect; 5512 and 5513 of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code were not unconstitutionally vague. The president also asserted that &sect;&sect; 5512 and 5513 were unconstitutionally overbroad. It was argued that the scope of &quot;unlawful gambling&quot; as defined in those sections included conduct of the fire department that was protected by the First Amendment. The president claimed that those sections prevented peaceful and legitimate entities, like the fire department, from utilizing a source of revenue collection. The court disagreed because the fire department had other sources of revenue and did not depend only on gambling. The court also held that the state had the power to suppress gambling and that the legislature had to power to allow certain forms of gambling by legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion to quash information and found Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 5512 and 5513 of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The remaining trustees of a charitable testamentary trust filed an account following the death of one of the trustees, and beneficiary institutions refused to appoint representatives to a scholarship selection committee, which was created by the trust, because scholarships were restricted on the basis of race and religion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A testatrix's will contained various charitable bequests to institutions that benefited all races and sexes, and it also created a trust fund to provide scholarships for &quot;deserving white Christian young men.&quot; The trust provisions stated that such students were to be chosen by a selection committee appointed by certain institutions. Those institutions refused to appoint representatives to the committee, however, claiming that it was discriminatory. These objections were raised in the trustees' account proceedings. In confirming the account, the court ruled that the trust was lawful because the testatrix had a right to give her property to whomever she wished, but it could not be judicially enforced because that would constitute discriminatory state action in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, considering the will as a whole, which was not otherwise exclusionary, it did not appear that the testatrix would have chosen termination of the trust. Thus, under the doctrine of deviation, it was judicially modified to eliminate the discriminatory provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustees' account was confirmed nisi, but a clause restricting scholarships to &quot;white Christian young men&quot; was stricken from the trust, and the trustees were directed to insure that students were selected solely on the basis of their scholastic record and intellectual achievements. On supplemental adjudication, financial need was permitted to be a consideration when scholastic record and intellectual achievements were substantially equal.</SPAN></P>

The insurance company alleged that the terms of the insurance contract, as modified by a PIP amendment under the Pennsylvania No-fault Act, precluded recovery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent had executed a PIP amendment and returned it to the insurance company shortly before his death. The amendment stated that coverage did not apply to bodily injury to any person sustained while occupying a motorcycle. The court granted the insured's motion for summary judgment and held as follows: (1) while it was true that the PIP Amendment did not afford no-fault coverage to persons injured while occupying a motorcycle, it did not automatically follow that the insured's claim for funeral and burial expenses was properly rejected; (2) the introductory sentence to the PIP Amendment stated that its provisions were subject to all the terms of the policy except as modified by the amendment; (3) therefore, coverage for medical and related expenses, other than no-fault coverage, based on a provision of the original policy were still effective unless expressly superseded by the terms of the amendment; and (4) none of the provisions of the PIP Amendment specifically and unequivocally extinguished medical coverage under the original policy for claims not subject to the no-fault legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, coal company and business owner, objected to findings that they did not meet a 40-year statute of limitations for adverse possession of a street under 12 P.S. &sect;&sect; 77, 78 and that defendant supermarket was the beneficial owner. The supermarket objected to findings that it was not entitled to an injunction enjoining plaintiffs from using the street and that it failed to prove that it was entitled to compensatory or punitive damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought title by adverse possession or exclusive use through a prescriptive easement, under a 21-year statute of limitations, to a street that divided plaintiffs' property from that of the supermarket. The supermarket sought a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining plaintiffs from using and interfering with the supermarket's use of the street, a decree declaring that the supermarket was the beneficial owner of the street under a 40-year statute of limitations, and both compensatory and punitive damages. The court entered judgment in favor of the supermarket, concluding that all parties and the strip were within Philadelphia's city limits. Thus, the 40-year statute of limitations under &sect;&sect; 77, 78 applied. The court held that the coal company failed to provide testimony that supported its claim that it was in possession of the strip for at least 40 years. The business owner's prior possession was not continuous because of gaps, which included other employment and a stint in the army, and because it was not exclusive. Videotaped depositions from former residents were admissible to support the supermarket's claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied plaintiffs' complaint in equity seeking title by adverse possession or exclusive use through a prescriptive easement to a street which divided plaintiffs' property from that of the supermarket. The court denied the supermarket's demand for a preliminary and permanent injunction and demand for compensatory and punitive damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant ran through a stop sign, and one of his passengers was killed. He was convicted of homicide by vehicle. The court granted defendant's motion for post-trial relief on the ground that the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court reasoned that the sole relevant violation was defendant's failure to yield the right of way in entering a through highway without halting for a stop sign. The court first examined the legal of culpability required by looking at 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 302, 305 and concluded that negligence, defined as a gross deviation from the standard of care, applied. The court then examined the facts, noting that defendant was not influenced by drugs or alcohol; he knew the intersection was heavily traveled; he proceeded straight across the highway without any evidence that he slowed down; the skid marks were consistent with the explanation of brake failure; and the evidence as to the condition of the brakes following the accident was at best inconclusive. The court reasoned that to accept the jury's version the court had to conclude that at best defendant was playing Russian roulette.</SPAN></P>

The son sought leave to file a petition for review of an earlier adjudication on the grounds that the judges had no power to make the adjudication or that the adjudication should have been set aside on equitable grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son's claim against the estate was previously presented and denied by the court on exceptions to the account and statement of proposed distribution. No petition for review or appeal of that order was filed. The administrator then made full distribution of the estate. The court recognized a later decision which held that Pennsylvania Probate Code &sect; 2107, governing children of unwed parents, was unconstitutional. The court ruled that its prior adjudication was required to stand unless review was permissible, or it was barred by federal court order from making it, or there were equitable grounds for setting it aside. Granting the petition for discharge of fiduciary, each of these possibilities was considered and rejected. Full distribution had been made pursuant to the confirmation, long before the son's exceptions were filed. Statutory review was clearly impermissible. The court ruled that the equities were not with the son. He had his opportunity to appeal the confirmation decree and declined to do so, thereby waiving any further claim of inheritance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The exceptions to the petition for discharge of fiduciary were dismissed and review of the confirmed first and final account and statement of proposed distribution was denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The policy covered active members of the association that participated in a certain percentage of all fires and drills over a twelve-month period. The insurer refused payment to the beneficiaries because each deceased was not an active member. The association had active members that, by its definition, included members who participated at a certain level and members who were life members for 20 years of services. Both of the deceased were life members. They had not met the participation requirements listed in the policy. Dismissing the complaints, the court concluded that the policy did not violate the Insurance Company Law of May 17, 1921, P.L. 682, as amended, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 40, &sect; 341 et seq. The purpose of the statute was to supply insurance to firefighters who took great risks while actively engaged in their activities. The statute permitted classes of association members to be insured, although once a class was established all members of it had to be insured.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's post-trial motions, which raised the question of the constitutionality of Pennsylvania's vehicular homicide statute,&nbsp;Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. tit. 75, &sect; 3732, following his conviction thereunder, were before the court en banc.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a finding of violation of the following too closely provisions of the Pa. Vehicle Code. This was critical, since a conviction for vehicle homicide was dependent upon a showing of violation of a traffic regulation. The court held that the fact finder could reasonably have concluded not simply that a collision occurred, but that, in following a vehicle more closely than was reasonable and prudent it was reasonably foreseeable a collision could occur. Even though the vehicle homicide statute imposed no culpability requirement, the underlying offenses required proof of the culpability elements of recklessness and negligence. The court also concluded that law enforcement personnel diligently pursued the investigation. Indeed, the police were to be commended rather than criticized for wanting to assure themselves that it was appropriate to prosecute, so they had complied with 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5553. The indictment was sufficient, since it charged the crime of vehicle homicide in substantially the language of the statute. Defendant failed to persuade the court that the statute was unconstitutional for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that defendant's motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial be denied and dismissed. Defendant was directed to appear for sentencing.</SPAN></P>

P.L. 586, as amended, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6704, for the support of a child born out of wedlock.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There were no allegations in the complaint that would have tolled the statute of limitations governing criminal proceedings. Upon the motion for judgment on the pleadings, the court found in favor of the parent. The court held that the action was barred under prior law, ruling that in the absence of a clear and manifest intention, it must be presumed that the legislature did not intend to give retroactive effect to actions barred by prior law, pursuant to 1 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1926. The court found that the prior law made a criminal determination of paternity a prerequisite to civil proceeding. The court ruled that rights to claim support by a child born out of wedlock were not conferred by the Civil Procedural Support Law, but by other law, such as the Support Law of June 24, 1937, Pa. P.L. 2045, as amended, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 62, &sect; 1973. The court continued that the Civil Procedural Support Law only afforded the means by which duties could have been enforced, whereas in the Support Law of June 24, 1937, Pa. P.L. 2045, as amended, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 62, &sect; 1973, it was definitely provided that a parent was liable for the support of his child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company filed exceptions to the decision of a chancellor (Pennsylvania), which denied an injunction. The company requested a preliminary and permanent injunction to restrain defendant property owners from bringing criminal prosecutions against the company and its employee for alleged violations of &sect; 401 and &sect; 402 of the Aeronautical Code of May 25, 1933, P.L. 1001, Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There had been three prosecutions against the company and its employee arising out of flights of a plane of the company in and out of an airport. The chancellor held that the airport was subject to both state and federal regulations concerning the minimum safe altitude and that there was insufficient evidence to show that there were baseless criminal charges filed and a multiplicity or threatened multiplicity of criminal proceedings by the property owners. In enjoining the property owners from filing criminal charges under &sect; 401 and &sect; 402 of the Aeronautical Code of May 25, 1933, P.L. 1001, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 2, &sect;&sect; 1467, 1468, and from filing any other criminal charges arising out of take offs and landings of the company's planes from the airport, the court found that the chancellor made an erroneous decision. The multiplicity of actions had been established. If the court affirmed the chancellor's findings and decision and refused the company injunctive relief, it would result in a multitude of criminal prosecutions against the company and its agents and irreparable harm through loss of property. Any state laws in conflict with federal regulations could not be enforced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant condemnation was part of a projected redevelopment of a portion of a borough damaged by flood waters from a tropical storm. The redevelopment project was commenced pursuant to and under authority of the Pennsylvania Urban Redevelopment Law of May 24, 1945, P.L. 991, 35 Pa. Stat. &sect; 1701 et seq. The landowner's principal contention was that the proposed redevelopment area, in which the landowner's premises were located, was never properly determined to be a blighted area as required by the statute. The only finding or certification of blight with respect to the proposed redevelopment area was found, if at all, in a one page document. The court held that the four characteristics set forth in the document were not the equivalents of, nor did they bear any relationship to, the characteristics of blight set forth in the statute. While the document found that the area was damaged as a result of natural catastrophe, the term blight signified that type of condition which could generally be characterized as urban obsolescence and decay which is beyond salvage by private rehabilitation and requires relatively large scale action by governmental entities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although he did not attend school due to illness, the student drove into the school parking lot to pick up a cousin. When a police officer noticed that the student lacked a parking permit, he approached the car and noted a marijuana odor. The officer then searched the car and found more marijuana. Pursuant to the school district's regulation requiring exclusion for any student found in possession of restricted drugs on school grounds, the student was suspended for 10 days until a hearing was conducted 17 days later. When no decision was forthcoming after the hearing, the student obtained the injunction mandating his immediate reinstatement. The court based its decision on a conclusion that the Board's decision was not in accordance with the applicable requirements of &sect; 8(b) of the Local Agency Law, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 11308(b), nor with the methods for exclusion promulgated by the state Board of Education in 22 Pa. Code &sect;&sect; 12.6 and 12.8.

Stat. Ann. tit. 50, &sect; 4406, that an affected 22-year-old patient be committed to a state institution due to the insufficient resources at his private placement to provide the supervision he required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">From age 8 to 22, the patient had been living in a placement at a privately-operated residential school, but he reached the point where the school believed its staff was insufficient to provide the requisite supervision. The proposed interim placement was at a facility where the ratio of student to teacher was 14 to 1, whereas the school's ratio was 7 to 1. In addition, the Program had been ordered to locate or develop a placement appropriate for the patient's needs within six months. On appeal, the Program argued that the order extended beyond the confines of &sect; 406 of the Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of 1966, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 50, &sect; 4406. While the requested placement was not appropriate to encompass the type of training and supervision the patient required to enhance his potential and reduce the necessity for constant supervision, the court found that no such facility existed at that time to accommodate him. However, the thrust of the patient's right to due process enveloped not only what existed, but what could be developed. The order, mandating a good faith effort at finding or developing a responsive placement, ensured the patient's right to due process.</SPAN></P>

Also, the statute did not violate due process because the standard to guide prospective conduct was manifestly clear and manifestly reasonable. The statute did not impose cruel and unusual punishment because its intent was to serve as a deterrent to the violation of traffic laws leading to steadily growing carnage.

Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 11-1122, which permitted a school board to terminate the services of a professional employe at the age of 65 or the age at which the employe became eligible to receive full benefits under the Social Security Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher was a 69-year-old man in good health who had been employed as a Philadelphia school teacher for more than 25 years. The teacher admitted that he was eligible to receive full benefits at the time of his termination. The board stipulated that the teacher was in every way qualified and able to teach, but contended that the Federal Social Security Act permitted the teacher's termination of employment by reason of age. The court held that under Pennsylvania law, age was a suspect classification. The question, therefore, was whether there was an arbitrary or invidious classification between school teachers under the age of 65 and those over the age of 65. The court found that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) amendments of April 6, 1978, 1978 Pa. Laws 95-256, raised the mandatory retirement age of employes in interstate commerce to 70. The court found that the ADEA was inapplicable to the teacher.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a redevelopment authority, a shopping complex, and a business, moved for a preliminary injunction against defendants, an association of black community organizations and other individuals. An ex parte temporary injunction had been granted enjoining and restraining defendants from any mass picketing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The redevelopment authority was the owner of the shopping complex, so defendants chose those businesses to protest the federal government's expenditure of urban renewal funds. Specifically, they claimed the failure to give enough money to the black communities. An immediate ex parte temporary injunction was issued to enjoin and restrain the mass picketing, and the order also defined permissible conduct. Thereafter, the court granted plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, noting that this was a &quot;scapegoat boycott&quot; where there was no real or bonafide dispute with the businesses, but rather, they were simply the &quot;target&quot; to express a grievance against the redevelopment authority. The court found that it had to balance defendants constitutionally protected right to free speech with the businesses' right to survive. The court ruled that defendants had a rights to deliver their valid message; however, they were not permitted to boycott with the express intention to punish the businesses for lawfully accepting the government benefits. The court cited the &quot;unlawful purpose&quot; doctrine, and held that defendants' strategy was a malicious misuse of their First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The temporary and special injunction was modified and amended to enjoin and restrain defendants from picketing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a probate action, the account of the executor of a decedent's estate was called for audit. The court confirmed the account nisi. The court allowed the claim of an assignee because a judicial decision that struck down a mortmain statute as being unconstitutional could not be imposed retroactively to defeat the assignee's claim. The court reasoned that the assignee had paid money on two separate occasions, in good faith reliance upon the undoubted laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania which operated to indefeasibly vest the entire remainder interest in the trust in his assignor. The court determined that the assignee was a bona fire purchaser for value without notice of any defect in the title of his assignor. In addition, the court noted that the assignee had paid substantial death taxes in good faith reliance upon the validity of the mortmain statute. The court concluded that fundamental equities required the court to protect the assignee's interests as against the charities who had not changed their positions at all since the death of the testator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an eminent domain case, a jury determined that plaintiff property owner was entitled to a certain amount as just compensation for a taking of portions of his farm for highway purposes. Defendant, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, filed a motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its motion for a new trial, the Commonwealth asserted, among other things, that testimony regarding noise and annoyance from highway traffic should not have been considered as a factor affecting fair market value of the property. The court disagreed and denied the motion. The court held that the rule was that where there was an actual taking, the effects of noise and highway annoyance, which were the necessary consequence of lawful and proper operation of the road, upon the market value of the unappropriated residue, were proper considerations by a fact finder in determining the after value of the residue. The court arrived at its holding by analyzing judicial decisions rendered prior to the enactment of the Eminent Domain Code and by considering the specific provisions of the Code. The court determined that &sect; 606 of the Code was intended to be declaratory of prior law, which provided that noise and associated annoyance were elements considerable in fixing value of the residue after a partial-taking, even though those effects were commonly suffered by the community in the vicinity of the road.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two counts of harassment. A district justice found defendant guilty and fined him $ 150 on each count. On appeal, a trial de novo resulted in a guilty verdict with the same total of $ 300 in fines and an additional sentence of 30 days in prison. Defendant filed motions for arrest of judgment, a new trial, and modification of sentence. The court denied the motions, holding that: (1) the evidence was amply to support defendant's conviction under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2709 because defendant's repeated barrages of stereo sound, verbal and otherwise oral offensives, and gestured threats of hand-to-hand combat amounted to a course of conduct calculated to alarm and annoy his neighbor; (2) the citation was not substantively defective under Pa. R. Crim. P. 250 because defendant was specified by name and events were described so as to put defendant on notice of the nature of the charges; (3) defendant's failure to object to the complaint before trial amounted to a waiver of a defect under Pa.

The township sought review. On appeal, the court struck and set aside the award. The court held that the township commissioners could not delegate their authority to fix the compensation of the police force by a past practice not authorized under the First Class Township Code, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 56401. The court opined that the township commissioners could not delegate to the arbitrator the final and binding authority to use that past practice and alter the plain language of their own collective bargaining agreement.

DPW sought an amount paid to the client that she had promised to repay once she received a settlement of her tort claim. The attorney was brought into the action as garnishee because he held the settlement in an escrow account.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The client was injured in a car accident, and she received medical and public assistance pending her claim's settlement. The DPW required her to sign two forms in which she agreed to repay the benefits once her claim was settled and to pay all legal fees. In denying the petition, the court first held that the client did not raise issues that could be submitted to a jury as required under Pa. R. Civ. P. 2959(e). The petition was only supported by the attorney's affidavit, which was not sufficient evidence to open the case. Second, the lack of prior notice of the entry of the judgment against the client was unconstitutional only in consumer transactions. The client was not a consumer. Third, under controlling case law, the DPW had the constitutional right to condition the client's receipt of the benefits on signing the forms, and it was not against public policy. Fourth, the client had no right to demand that the DPW share in the attorney's fees because she agreed by signing the form to pay the fees. Finally, DPW was entitled to reimbursement for the benefits because the forms were valid and the client agreed to repay all the assistance granted to her by signing the forms.</SPAN></P>

The wife filed preliminary objections to the attachment on the basis that the procedures were unconstitutional and that the attachment issued against her property was invalid insofar as she was not permitted her statutory exemption under Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife's property was attached. She contended that as the Pennsylvania procedures regarding foreign attachment had been declared unconstitutional the procedure under Pa. R. Civ. P. 1285-1292 was similarly unconstitutional. She argued that as her property exempted from execution under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 2161 was exempt from execution it was likewise exempt from attachment. Upon review, the court determined that procedural due process did not require that the wife receive any more protection than was already provided by Pa. R. Civ. P. 1285-1292 because the post-seizure hearing process sufficiently protected her rights as a debtor. The court concluded, however, that since certain of the wife's property was exempt from execution it was also exempt from attachment pursuant to Pa. R. Civ. P. 1252. The court ruled that a debtor could not have, either expressly or by implication, waived the right of exemption as provided for in Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 2161.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the petition for forfeiture on the ground that the absence of due process requirements prior to forfeiture rendered the 1972 Act invalid. The Commonwealth argued that the 1972 Act was not unconstitutional and that, if the 1972 Act were unconstitutional, respondent's van should have been subject to forfeiture under the Act of July 3, 1941, (1941 Act), P.L. 263. Upon reconsideration, the court affirmed its judgment that the 1972 Act was unconstitutional as the forfeiture provisions of the 1972 violated the procedural due process rights of the owner of the vehicle. The court determined that the 1941 Act was repealed by the 1972 Act. The 1941 Act could not have been used to support the Commonwealth's petition for forfeiture. Since the constitutionality of an act must have rested upon the provisions of the act itself, for the 1972 Act to have passed constitutional muster, it must have provided for due process either within its text or by reference to other mandatory provisions.</SPAN></P>

The manager then locked the doors and summoned the police. When the suspects were arrested, no merchandise was found in the bag, but items of clothing were discovered scattered about the store in unusual places. During her interview with the police, defendant gave a false name and stated that she was a juvenile. In support of her motion for a new trial, she alleged that she had renounced the crime before its completion, that she was denied a chance to renounce her false statement, and that she was prejudiced because the information described the charge as her fourth offense. In affirming the conviction, the court held that renunciation was not a defense to the crimes of retail theft or the making of a false statement. Because the grade of the offense was determined by the number of prior convictions, it was essential that the prior offenses be recited in the information to give defendant notice of the charge she had to defend.</SPAN></P>

Defendants contended that their conduct did not constitute sexual activity as a business within the proscription against prostitution. The court denied defendants' motion for arrest of judgment and a new trial and upheld their convictions. The court ruled that when the term &quot;sexual activity&quot; was examined consistently with the statutory provision's underlying purpose of prohibiting commercial exploitation of sexual gratification, the conclusion was inescapable that masturbation as a business was within the proscription against prostitution. The court ruled that the statute did not fail for vagueness since to the mind of a man of common intelligence the term sexual activity clearly encompassed masturbation as a business. The jury's verdict was amply supported by the evidence and the testimony of undercover male police officer who visited defendants' spa and had their genitals &quot;massaged&quot; for a stipulated price.</SPAN></P>

Ann. tit. 77, &sect; 481(b) (1974). The manufacturer argued that &sect; 481(b) was unconstitutional due to the fact that it arbitrarily and capriciously eliminated a party's right to sue, which violated the equal protection provisions of Pa.

Defendant was summarily convicted in the trial court. On appeal, the court found defendant not guilty. The court noted that the conduct that constituted the alleged violation was not proscribed by the ordinance itself, but by a resolution adopted by the board of supervisors, purportedly under authority of the ordinance. The court ruled that townships had the power to regulate or prohibit dumping pursuant to 1933 Pa. Laws 103, art. VII, &sect; 702, as amended, 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65708. However, the court ruled that townships could only exercise that power through the adoption of ordinances, not resolutions.

He also set forth several affirmative defenses. In his petition seeking leave to amend his answer, the taxpayer asserted that he was aware of the futility of his Fifth Amendment plea after a recent Pennsylvania court decision. In denying his request for leave to amend, the court ruled that amendment of the taxpayer's answer would have been futile because he had no valid defense to the city's action. Because the taxpayer had failed to file a petition for review with the tax review board, he was barred from interposing his affirmative defenses. The court stated that the taxpayer's petition was yet another example of the frivolous and vexatious manner in which a group of non-residents had been seeking by non-meritorious defenses and dilatory tactics to evade or avoid properly assessed city taxes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The airport was forced to shorten its runway when defendants constructed a tall building on their property. The airport brought an action against defendants to obtain damages for their interference with the airport's easement in the air space. The airport contended that it had an easement over defendants' land by virtue of section 1 of the Pennsylvania Act of 1953 and by prescription. Defendants filed preliminary objections to the complaint. The court sustained the demurrer as to the airport's allegation that an easement was created by the act. The state could not transfer to the airport an interest in defendants' property. To construe the act as suggested by the airport would have rendered it unconstitutional. The court overruled the demurrer in all other respects. The airport could acquire an easement of passage over defendants' land by prescription. The airport's complaint was sufficient even though its allegations did not contain specific factual details to support its claim that the use of defendants' air space was continuous, open, notorious, adverse, and hostile. The airport was not required to plead evidence. The complaint gave defendants' sufficient notice of the claim.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague in that the language of the act failed to set forth with precision precisely what conduct was prohibited. The court denied defendant's motions for arrest of judgment and a new trial. The court held that beyond a reasonable doubt, defendant threatened to commit the crimes of simple or aggravated assault upon the two corrections officers and that he intended to terrorize the officers. The court found no merit in defendant's argument that the statute had been applied selectively to him. Defendant's witnesses simply were not in a position to know whether other prosecutions may have been instituted by the district attorney.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions stemmed from an incident in which he shot his former wife and her live-in boyfriend in their apartment.

On appeal, defendant contended that his offer of a videotape interview as general evidence at trial was improperly denied. He also claimed that he could not have been found guilty of rape, inasmuch as the victim of that offense was his wife. This argument was based on the premise that after their divorce, he and his former spouse were legally remarried when they renewed their vows before a priest. The court affirmed the judgment of convictions because the ceremony before the priest did not constitute a marriage, the ceremony did not supply the evidence of an intention to marry essential to a valid common-law marriage, the spouse relationship relied on by defendant for exculpation had been terminated, and the definition of the term &quot;spouse&quot; in 18 Pa.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the terroristic threats section of the Crimes Code was unconstitutional. The Commonwealth argued that defendant waived his right to contest the constitutionality by failing to present that issue in compliance with Pa. R. Crim. P. 1123(a). Post-verdict motions had to be filed within 10 days after a finding of guilt and had to include every assignment of error for preservation for appellate review. Defendant's post-verdict motions averred only the usual boilerplate reasons. The court held that defendant's written memorandum in support of his motions set forth the assignments of error now advanced. However, the court concluded that 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2706 was not on its face unconstitutionally vague. Defendant's actions sufficiently constituted the proscribed conduct. Defendant's intent to terrorize was proved beyond a reasonable doubt in view of his actions toward the complainant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue before the court were several instances in which the district attorney made statements before members of the media that falsely accused judges of being lenient towards certain defendants.

Despite the district attorney's having the right and duty to keep the public informed as to the operations of his office, and even his right and power to misinform the public in certain circumstances, those rights were subject to the fact that the district attorney was a lawyer and prosecutor. The challenged statements infringed upon defendants' rights to due process of law and fairness in the sentencing and parole processes, as well as at trial. Furthermore, the false statements were made in bad faith and not for the bona fide purpose of assisting the court in the difficult sentencing process. Thus, the court barred the district attorney from the sentencing process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 11011-8 authorized a salary increase for the elected official and provided that its provisions were to take effect immediately. The Controller asserted that Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 27 (1968), which provided that no law should extend the term of any public office or increase or diminish his salary after his election or appointment, prohibited the salary increase being paid to the elected official during his existing term of office. The court entered judgment in favor of the elected official, opining that the elected official was entitled to the salary increase authorized by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 11011-8. The court explained that Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 27 (1968) had to be read in conjunction with Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect; 4, which resulted in the conclusion that, because the legislators of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, through legislation, controlled salaries of public officers and county officers, the restriction applied only to their legislative salaries and none other. As such, the court concluded that a county employee, who was elected to office prior to the passage of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 11011-8, was entitled to the increased salary authorized by &sect; 11011-8.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the Commonwealth was required at a preliminary hearing to produce evidence that constituted sufficient probable cause to believe that the person charged had committed the crime. As to defendant one, the court reviewed the evidence and found that the Commonwealth had failed to meet its burden. As to defendant two, the court found that the Commonwealth had not met its burden as to the charges of conspiracy and theft of telecommunication services. However, the Commonwealth met its burden as to possession of an instrument for theft of telecommunication services, as the computer owned by defendant two could be used to commit telephone fraud. The court also rejected defendant two's request to suppress the evidence, as the affidavit in support of the search warrant adequately the circumstances to allow the magistrate properly to judge the validity of an informant's information.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. tit. 35, &sect; 780-128, for the seizure and forfeiture of a truck that was alleged to have been involved in the transportation of a controlled substance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner pled guilty to two counts of delivery of a controlled substance. The Commonwealth sought the forfeiture of the truck involved in the deliveries. The owner asserted that the forfeiture provisions of &sect; 780-128 were facially unconstitutional as violative of procedural due process by reason of the statute's failure to require the necessary procedural amenities. The court agreed and dismissed the Commonwealth's petition. The court found that the statute was unconstitutional and that &sect; 780-128(b)(4) could not be allowed to stand because the provision allowed for the seizure of property without process in that it failed to mandate any sort of notice or hearing to effect the forfeiture itself. Thus, the statute consequently offended due process. The forfeiture statute at issue could not be upheld simply because notice and a hearing were actually provided. The constitutionality of the statute had to rest upon the provisions of the statute itself. The presumption of the constitutionality of the statute was overcome.</SPAN></P>

The court denied defendant's motion in arrest of judgment. The court held that a public nuisance was one that obstructed or caused inconvenience to the public in the exercise of rights common to all residents. The court ruled that the common good required that parents residing with their children in close proximity to others in an urban residential neighborhood control and supervise their offspring.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested on a warrant charging him with burglary. After he had been fingerprinted and photographed at police headquarters, the arresting officer left defendant alone in an interview room. Defendant was neither attended nor restrained at this time so the arresting officer sent another officer to watch defendant. Within seconds, the officer dispatched to guard defendant, informed the arresting officer that the interview room was deserted. Defendant was found about a month later. He was arrested and charged with the crime of escape. Defendant filed a motion to quash the escape charge. He argued that the crime of escape was unconstitutionally vague in that there were insufficient distinguishing criteria between the definitions of escape and the crime of resisting arrest. He further contended that this vagueness offended the notion of due process and resulted in an improper delegation of the legislative function to the police. The court disagreed. The court found that the escape statute was not vague. The Pennsylvania legislature neither desired nor intended to make criminal mere flight from arrest under the obstructing justice section nor the resisting arrest section.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found defendants not guilty. The court held that the Commonwealth failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the property-owner defendant knew of the plans for the event. The court further ruled that the law was unconstitutional special legislation and held that the Board would not have attempted such legislation had it not been informed of the plans for the concert in advance.

The wife alleged that she was without funds to maintain herself and defend against the action. The husband argued that the wife was gainfully employed and had the funds to defend against the action. The court stated that the issue was whether a wife whose financial position was substantially the same as her husband's was nevertheless entitled to the customary nominal award of counsel fees in divorce. The court stated that there had been a long standing common practice of routinely awarding a wife a nominal counsel fee in the early stages of a divorce case, without inquiring into relative ability of the parties to pay or the extent of legal services performed or to be performed. However, the court found that because the status of women had changed over the years, the rule should be changed and that a wife whose income or estate approximates that of her husband should be denied an order for alimony pendente lite, counsel fees and expenses.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was arrested and charged with the criminal homicide of the fetus. Defendant was incarcerated in lieu of bail. Defendant filed a writ of habeas corpus contending that he was illegally detained upon the charge of homicide because a fetus not yet born, was not a human being as that term was used in the Crimes Code, and could not be the victim of a homicide.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police officer sought review of a decision by appellee Acting Chief of Police of Warminster Township to issue him a letter of reprimand, which charged him with a violation of the 1967 Warminster Township Pa. Police Department Duty Manual, art. 1, &sect; 1.09. The chief filed an answer and a motion for a rule to show cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer was reprimanded for using rude or insulting language or conduct offensive to the public. A stipulation was entered into that the officer did not have a hearing and that he had not requested one. The court then requested briefs as to whether or not the officer was entitled to a hearing before the local agency on the issuance of the reprimand and whether or not the reprimand was an &quot;adjudication&quot; within the meaning of the Pa. Local Agency Law of December 2, 1968, P.L. 1133, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 11301 et seq. The court dismissed the officer's appeal without prejudice. The court found that the first issue was determining whether the police department qualified as a &quot;local agency&quot; under the Local Agency Law and held that it did. The next issue was whether the reprimand rose to the level of an &quot;adjudication.&quot; Here, the court did not find that the reprimand rose to the level of an adjudication because none of the officer's constitutional rights had been infringed. The court stated that there was a significant government interest in regulating some speech of police officers and, therefore, the court held that the officer's conduct fell within this proscribed area.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the officer was not entitled to a hearing, however, this holding was without prejudice to his rights to question the appropriateness of his reprimand in the event any future adjudication adverse to him was based in whole or in part on said reprimand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant wrote a check off his corporate account to pay a past due invoice for goods and services received, knowing that there were insufficient funds in the account. Following his conviction, defendant argued that because he was paying a past due debt and did not simultaneously receive valid consideration at the time he passed the check, no crime occurred. The court held that defendant was correct under the old law, but the new Crimes Code of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1482, &sect; 1, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4105, had removed the prior, required elements of both an intent to defraud, and the simultaneous receiving of consideration, and such elements could not be inferred or read into the new statute. It was enough to pass a check knowing the payee would not honor it. The court also held that defendant was not relieved of individual criminal liability just because the check was drawn on a corporate account by a corporate officer and that the corporation's bankruptcy did not bar the criminal prosecution for the violation of state law. The trial court also held that it simply did not believe defendant's claim that he post-dated the check and asked the other party to hold it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the trial court (Pennsylvania) of driving with an expired registration, in violation of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 75, &sect; 511(b). Because a prerequisite to obtaining registration was getting vehicle insurance, which allegedly violated his religious beliefs, defendant appealed the conviction, claiming the law violated freedom of religion guaranteed him by U.S. Const. amend. I, as applied to the states by U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant claimed that he followed the tenets of a church that forbade the acquisition of any type of insurance. Defendant argued that the compulsory insurance requirement of the No-Fault Automobile Insurance Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 40, 1009.01 et seq., violated his freedom of religion and, thus, was unconstitutional. Further, given that he was denied registration for his car because he did not have insurance for it, defendant argued that his conviction could not stand. The court recognized that U.S. Const. amend. I protected one's freedom of belief absolutely but did not bar reasonable restrictions upon one's freedom to act, provided that they were related to a compelling state interest. Acknowledging that resolutions of attacks made upon statutes as violating one's freedom of religion involved an analysis of competing interests, the court found that the compulsory insurance of the Act was a key component in the State's goal of providing a comprehensive automobile accident compensation system and that such was a valid exercise of the State's police power, which outweighed defendant's interests in his religious tenets. Thus, the Act was upheld.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the taxpayers' equity complaint had to be stricken for failure to comply with court rules. The court held: (1) where Pa. R. Civ. P. 2102(b) required actions brought against political subdivisions to be brought against them in their names, the taxpayers' had violated this rule when they named the individual directors as defendants, as well as the district itself; (2) neither Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 5566(b) nor Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 6906 provided an adequate legal remedy by which the taxpayers could challenge the legality of the taxes at issue because they were only procedural statutes and did not address the merits of the taxpayers' claims; (3) the well-pleaded allegations of the taxpayers' complaint set forth numerous grounds that alleged more than a mere allegation of unconstitutionality, and were sufficient to support equity jurisdiction; (4) the taxpayers had standing because their interests were substantial and affected by the taxes in question; and (5) where the taxpayers failed to attach a copy of the district's resolution to their complaint or to state why they had failed to do so, the complaint failed to conform with Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The provider raised its rates, applicable to the owner's motel, by 300 percent. The owner filed its complaint, alleging that the provider's rate increase violated the parties' agreement and FCC regulations. The owner also challenged the validity of a township ordinance that granted a license to the provider without providing for any notice as to rate increases. The provider filed preliminary objections. The court held that the township was not entitled to impose regulations on the provider because it lacked any regulatory authority other than that specifically devised by the legislature in Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 66156. The owner's complaint as to FCC Regulation &sect; 76.31(a)(4) was defective because the FCC had deleted &sect; 76.31(a)(4) when it recognized that it could not give authority to franchising bodies, such the township, that lacked regulatory authority under State law. The court denied the provider's objections because the owner's complaint as to the parties' oral agreement for service alleged that the provider had orally assured the owner of a stable service rate.

The teacher filed an action in mandamus seeking to compel the school board to restore him to his former position. The school board filed preliminary objections requesting dismissal of the teacher's complaint. In his answer to the school board's preliminary objections, the teacher contended that the statutory retirement provision was unconstitutional, arbitrary, capricious, and discriminatory. The court noted that if the teacher's challenge to the legality of the retirement provision were sustained, the board would be obligated to reinstate the teacher because non of the causes of terminated enumerated in &sect; 11-1122 were designated in the teacher's removal notice. The court dismissed the school board's preliminary objections because the law did not preclude an action challenging the legality of discrimination on the basis of age contained in a retirement statute.</SPAN></P>

Letters of administration were granted to decedent's wife. An alleged illegitimate son of the decedent claimed an intestate share of the estate.

The court held that the Pennsylvania statute of the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code of June 30, 1972, 20 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2107, was unconstitutional by discriminating on the basis of illegitimacy. It violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. However, a finding of paternity was required to establish an illegitimate child's right to claim a share of a decedent's estate. Here, paternity was established in a state court paternity action and the decedent was ordered to contribute to the support of the child.

The wife asserted that the validity of the service of the subpoena on the nonresident witness was found under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 297. The court held that &sect; 297 could only be read as applicable to a defendant in an action, unless Pa. R. Civ. P. 2079(b) contravened the right of the general assembly to determine jurisdiction. The court found that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 297 was inapplicable to the witness because he was not a defendant to the action. The court found that requiring the witness to appear in Philadelphia would constitute an unreasonable burden on him. The court granted the witness' motion to quash the subpoena duces tecum and to issue a protective order was the witness would be unduly oppressed if his attendance were required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation filed a bill in equity seeking injunctive relief from the prohibitions of an ordinance adopted by defendant township. The ordinance prohibited the selling of merchandise, including food, from motor vehicles parked or stopped in the right-of-way of any township street. A preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of the ordinance was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation engaged in the street sale of ice cream. The corporation claimed that the ordinance was unconstitutional and that the ordinance applied only to motor vehicles and not to other types of vehicles which might be used in their business and that there was no rational reason for this distinction or discrimination. The court found that the purpose of the ordinance was to protect the safety of the community, which was a legitimate public purpose that was within the municipality's police power. The ordinance was rationally related, and in fact essential, to the achievement of that purpose. By virtue of its size and shape, an ice cream truck created an obstruction, even when parked, around which a motorist might have difficulty seeing, and therefore might fail to notice a child darting into the street. These dangers either did not exist or were significantly less in the case of non-motorized vehicles engaged in the street sale of ice cream. Moreover, the ordinance was not void for vagueness because its language gave fair notice of the type of conduct that was forbidden. Finally, the ordinance took away no rights to which the corporation was otherwise entitled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pastor's small church was located in a high density residential area. The church services were held nightly and as part of the service music was produced by electronically magnified instruments. Neighborhood residents complained of the loud noises. The pastor was issued three citations for violating the anti-noise ordinance. Defendant argued that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court found that the ordinance that prohibited the use of sound devises which produced sounds within a building that escaped the walls of that building and could be heard on public streets was not overbroad. The ordinance was not intended to restrict expression or communication but rather to maintain peace and tranquility. It was also not vague or ambiguous because it only prevented amplification devisees that would cause sound to reach public streets. This proscription was narrowly defined and had a clear meaning. Defendant was not impaired in his right of free speech. There was no impingement on freedom of religion. The rights of the neighboring public prevailed. Accordingly the court found defendant guilty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a husband and a wife (mortgagors), brought a complaint in equity against defendant mortgagee, seeking to nullify a sheriff's sale of the subject property. Plaintiffs, a husband and a wife (couple) sought damages for the loss of personal property stored at the property and allegedly destroyed or damaged by defendant individual, who filed a counterclaim against the couple that was later withdrawn. The parties excepted to a decree nisi.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The crux of the dispute was a mortgage loan agreement negotiated between the mortgagors and the mortgagee. The court held that the loan and the disbursement of the loan moneys, including an illegal service charge, were fraudulently induced and in violation of the Pennsylvania Debt Pooling Act of 1961 (Act), 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7312 (1972), as amended by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4899, as well as usury laws. Hence, the agreement was void and unenforceable as a violation of the Act. Thus, the confession of judgment against the mortgagors and the sheriff's sale, at which the individual purchased the subject property, were stricken as void and the property was reinstated in the names of the mortgagors. Yet, even a wrongdoer like the mortgagee was entitled to the return of that portion of the loan devoted to the mortgagors' benefit. The individual, who was not a &quot;good faith&quot; purchaser because he knew of the mortgagee's deceptive practices, was directed to give the mortgagors immediate possession of the property. However, he had a right to seek relief against the mortgagee. Further, the couple's claim for damages was dismissed because they did not prove the value of their property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered a final decree sustaining and dismissing certain exceptions filed by the parties to a decree nisi. The mortgagors were entitled to have the title to the property reinstated in their name because the mortgage loan agreement was void and unenforceable as a violation of the Act. The couple's claim of damages was dismissed. However, the decree was without prejudice to the individual's pursuit of damages against the mortgagee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of failing to support his bastard child. Following his conviction, defendant filed motions for post-trial relief, challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 4323 of the Crimes Code. The court refused and dismissed defendant's motions. The court found that &sect; 4323 was not discriminatory against males, noting that the only distinction drawn by the statute concerned the time limitations within which such prosecutions could have been brought. Citing &sect; 3 of the Crimes Code, which provided for the severance of invalid portions of the code, the court found that the net effect of invalidating any discriminatory provisions of the statute would have merely yielded a uniform statute of limitations as to both sexes and would not have served to render the statute unconstitutional. Moreover, citing the Statutory Construction Act of November 25, 1970, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 1, &sect; 1902 (1970), which provided that words of the masculine gender included both the feminine and neuter genders, the court found that the reference to &quot;he&quot; in &sect; 4323 of the Crimes Code meant that both mothers and fathers were liable for the support of their dependent children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon defendant's conviction in a trial court (Pennsylvania) for escape, under the (Pennsylvania) Crimes Code of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1482, &sect; 5121(a), 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 85121, defendant filed a motion in arrest of judgment and for new trial. Defendant argued that the statute was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause because the penalty fell unequally on persons who committed the crime of escape.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to defendant's escape, he was incarcerated on an arrest warrant for felony assault and for parole violation. Defendant was convicted of escape, the crime of which provided for a hasher sentence for escape on a felony charge that that of a misdemeanor. On appeal, defendant contended that his incarceration at the time of escape was due solely to the parole board detainer, which did not constitute an official detention. The court rejected the contention, holding that the bail was not, in fact, given on the assault charges; had that been done, defendant's detention would rest solely on the parole board detainer. Second, the detainer for the alleged violation of parole was an official detention, which defendant could escape from and be found guilty of for the offense of escape. The court also held that the statute was not unconstitutional. The legislature could reasonably consider escape by a felon or an accused felon to be a greater danger and to merit greater punishment than escape by one accused only of a misdemeanor. Acceptance of that rationale was dispositive of the equal protection argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The executor contended that the tax assessment was unconstitutional because it resulted in the imposition of a retroactive tax and was violative of Pa.

The executor argued that the rate of two percent, which was in effect in 1943 when settlor renounced her testamentary power and the interests of the remaindermen vested, was correct. The court held that the legislature specifically imposed an inheritance tax at the rate in effect on the date of the death of the settlor on trusts in which the settlor retained a life estate with the remainder passing at his death, and that it was logical to tax property whose enjoyment by remaindermen was postponed until the death of the settlor at the same rates as other property passing as a result of his death. The court further held that the only taxable event which occurred with respect to the trust occurred on the settlor's death when the right to the enjoyment of the trust passed to the remaindermen, that this was the date when the Commonwealth's right to collect inheritance taxes arose, and that the date of settlor's death was the date which should logically fix the rate of tax in the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A writ and the complaint were served on a garnishee, which possessed bicycles owned by the corporation. The Washington resident alleged that it placed a bicycle order for which commissions were promised and not paid and that the Washington resident incurred certain expenditures at the instance of the corporation. The court found that it had the power to hear and to determine the subject matter in controversy between the parties. Under Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 5, the court of common pleas had unlimited original jurisdiction in all cases except as otherwise provided by law. It had jurisdiction over all actions of assumpsit under Pa.R.C.P. 1001 et seq. The fact that the court could not have granted the relief sought was not determinative of whether it had the power to inquire into the case. Seizure was improper, and the attachment had to be dissolved.

The court held that defendant's motion was late by a small amount of time and considered the merits of defendant's argument. Although the Commonwealth and its agents were prohibited from electronic eavesdropping, the manager, a private individual, had a constitutional right, under Pa. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The critical issue before the court was whether the case which held that the Pennsylvania Foreign Attachment Procedure was unconstitutional was applicable prospectively or retrospectively. The court held that the application was retrospective. Therefore, the court concluded that the attachment process and the form of action employed by the bank were a nullity. The court held that cancellation of the bond was warranted. The court determined that if the court that declared the Pennsylvania Foreign Attachment Procedure had intended prospective application then it would have explicitly said so. The court rejected the bank's argument that the principal had waived whatever right it may have had to void the attachment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord owned a commercial building and leased part of it to a tenant who also bought furniture and other goods from the landlord. The tenant entered into a lease with the company for a copier, which the company installed in the premises. The copier contained a visible plaque with a notice of the company's ownership. The tenant abandoned the premises owing the landlord money. The landlord secured judgment against the tenant and levied on all of the personal property except the copier. The company had not been paid rent for the copier, so it sought to remove it, but the landlord denied permission. The landlord authorized the constable to levy and distrain on the copier for rent due from the tenant. A sale date was fixed for the copier, and the company filed an action to restrain the sale. The court ordered the copier returned to the company. The landlord was knowledgeable of the practice of renting photocopying equipment and was present at the time of the installation of the copier. Even if parts of the Act were unconstitutional, these facts, coupled with the plaque on the copier in a visible part of it, provided sufficient notice under the Act to exempt the copier from sale.</SPAN></P>

The merchants attacked the ordinance on the basis that there was no substantial relationship between the ordinance itself and the objectives that the borough may legitimately attain under &sect;&sect; 1202(6) and (74) of the Borough Code of February 1, 1966. The court reviewed the record and upheld the ordinance, concluding that the merchants failed to carry their burden of proof in overcoming the presumption in favor of the constitutionality of municipal ordinances. The court further held that noncompliance with &sect;&sect; 1008 and 1009 of the Borough Code relative to the recording of ordinances may not be raised in an action to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The mayor vetoed the ordinance amending the code. The city council overrode the mayor's veto. The mayor filed a declaratory judgment action asking the court to rule on the ordinance's validity. The court held that the overall purpose of the legislature by enacting the Act of July 15, 1957, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 41101 et seq., known as the Optional Third Class City Charter Law, was to permit third class cities when choosing the mayor-council plan to operate the city government in a structure similar to the state and federal governments. The legislature intended that there be a separation of powers. The court held that the right of the mayor to appoint the solicitor was conditioned upon the manner, presuming that was reasonable and legal, as established by the council, but the exclusive appointment of the solicitor was not vested in the city council by the Optional Third Class City Charter Law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver's appeal of his conviction was still pending. The clerk in the common pleas court where the driver was convicted certified the record of the driver's conviction shortly after that court overruled post-trial motions and entered a suspended sentence. Those actions were almost a year after the trial. The court rejected the driver's argument that the lapse of time invalidated the revocation of his license. The court explained that the driver showed no harm or prejudice. The driver argued that the court should not permit the Commonwealth to use a conviction tainted by evidence obtained during an unlawful arrest to revoke his license. The court said that the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania) had addressed that issue and concluded that the argument was an impermissible collateral attack upon the conviction and judgment of sentence in the criminal proceeding. The court acknowledged the driver's argument that it was not fair or constitutional for the Commonwealth to withdraw his operating privileges while his appeal was pending. The court said that the driver's arguments were highly persuasive but they did not overcome the presumption of the constitutionality of legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver sought reversal of an order of the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation that imposed two successive, one-year revocations of his operating privilege for two convictions growing out of one incident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was convicted of failing to stop in one county and driving under the influence in the adjacent county. The sentence for each conviction included a mandatory one-year revocation of the driver's operating privileges. Because the driver surrendered his operator's license to the court on the first conviction, the first period of revocation began on that date. On receipt of the second conviction, the secretary issued an order suspending the driver's operating privilege for an additional year commencing on the expiration of the first period of revocation. On appeal from that order, the driver argued that it was illegal to impose two revocations where both offenses arose from the same set of facts. The court ruled that there was nothing illegal in imposing two revocation periods for two distinct offenses, but sustained the appeal because the secretary had not complied with the mandate of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 75, &sect; 616(a) to forthwith revoke the driver's privilege. Because &quot;forthwith&quot; meant immediately, the second period of revocation should have commenced on the date that the secretary received the record of conviction, rather than the date that the first revocation expired.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the appeal and remitted the matter to the secretary with directions to cause the second revocation period to commence on the date that the record was received rather than at the expiration of the first period of revocation.</SPAN></P>

The issue was whether the language of the penal statute offended the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Defendant invoked the leading cases that held that a criminal statute had to give adequate notice to a person of ordinary intelligence of the conduct that it purported to proscribe. The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the bill of indictment charging him with the abuse of a corpse. The court refused to hold that &sect; 5510 was unconstitutional. The legislature condemned in general terms the mutilation, sexual abuse, and gross neglect of dead bodies that the courts did when they found that conduct punishable as a common law misdemeanor. A man of ordinary intelligence would have known what ordinary family sensibilities were toward the disposition of dead bodies, and the legislature did not have to enumerate those sensibilities in any detail.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district attorney filed preliminary objections to both actions in the nature of a demurrer. The court found that the averments in the complaint were sufficient to bring the cause of action within at least three of the enumerated exceptions to the rule that equity will not restrain the prosecution of a criminal proceeding. The lawyers alleged interference with their right to practice their profession untrammeled by restraints on the concept of confidentiality inherent in the attorney-client relationship. The lawyers sought to participate in private meetings with their attorneys under circumstances involving actual litigation, threatened or impending litigation, general legal advice, consultation, and conferences. One of the grounds on which the district attorney's demurrer was based was the absence in the complaint of any averment of an actual controversy between the contending parties. The court held that such an averment was unquestionably a necessary element of the cause of action. It found that the lawyers failed to establish any controversy or antagonistic claims between the parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff borough filed an action in mandamus seeking a decree compelling the issuance of zoning and building permits to use property, which it owned and which was located in defendant township, for a public solid waste incinerator or trash facility.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The borough applied to the township for the issuance of zoning and building permits to use its property, located in the township, for the disposal of solid waste or trash. The township refused the borough's application because the proposed use violated the township's zoning and subdivision ordinances and its building code. Thereafter, the borough instituted the mandamus action, contending that the township should be compelled to issue the permits by virtue of a statute, which prohibited the adoption of an ordinance restricting the operation of any other political subdivision. In dismissing the complaint, the court noted that the borough had filed an earlier action seeking the court's approval of the proposed disposal site, as required by &sect; 2512 of The Borough Code of February 1, 1966, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 47512, and that court approval had been granted on the condition that the borough complied with the township's zoning ordinance. Thus, the court held that, if the Code was to be given effect, the borough could not insist on its having the power to conduct a disposal plant on its property in the township but, at the same time, reject the court's authority to approve the site.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a demurrer to an indictment charging him with recklessly endangering and terroristic threats, a violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2706.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case raised for the first time the question of the constitutionality of &sect; 2706. The court found that the statute was unconstitutional on its face because it failed to give fair notice and warning of the acts that were prohibited. Where the statute was derived from the Model Penal Code, the Code's commentary was examined in an attempt to glean the meaning of &quot;serious public inconvenience&quot; in &sect; 2706. Under the Code, &quot;serious public alarm or inconvenience&quot; included anonymous telephone calls threatening to bomb a theater or airplane. Such calls were easily included in &sect; 2706's provision concerning threats to commit any crime of violence with intent to cause evacuation of a building, place of assembly, or facility of public transportation. The additional clause penalizing threats, which in the eyes of policemen, judges, or juries were intended to cause &quot;serious public inconvenience,&quot; opened &sect; 2706 to exactly the abuse forbidden by the Due Process Clause. Enforcement without a clear and explicit definition of what was proscribed could only result in arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. Thus, a citizen was without fair notice and warning of the prohibited conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife filed a complaint in equity against defendant husband to enforce the provisions of their separation agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On June 2, 1975, the parties entered into a property settlement agreement. At that time, the parties were living separate and apart. On July 1, 1975, the wife instituted a divorce proceeding and a final decree in divorce was granted on or about December 5, 1975. The agreement provided that in the event a divorce decree was not entered within four months from its date, the agreement was null and void. The wife first argued that the court should not have sua sponte raised the issue of the contract's validity based on public policy considerations. The court dismissed the complaint, holding that because a contract that was void as violative of public policy would not have been enforceable in an equity court, it would have been an exercise in futility to decide the merits if the very contract was illegal. The court then concluded that the contract was against public policy and void. The court cited the provisions giving the wife a sum of money, a transfer of realty, and a transfer of a vehicle if she began divorce proceedings within a certain time. Such a contract was an agreement conducive to the obtaining of a divorce decree and, therefore, illegal and violative public policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant license holder challenged an order of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board revoking its club license. The Board argued that it lacked the authority, under the Act of April 12, 1951, P. L. 90, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 47, &sect; 4-474, to renew the license when more than two years had passed since the holder surrendered the license for safekeeping. The holder surrendered the license due to a flood on its premises that did not allow it to operate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The holder suspended the operation of its business due to a flood that extensively damaged the building. The holder was not able to demolish or rebuild the building. Its building committee searched for an alternative site. Various sites were found unsuitable. The holder finally entered into a purchase agreement for property. After the condemnation money from the fire was received, the deed was executed to the holder. The holder requested a renewal of the license. The Board argued that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 47, &sect; 4-474 violated the constitutional prohibition of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 32 against special class legislation. The court disagreed. The law only applied to club liquor licenses. The court reasoned that classification per se was not inherently unconstitutional, as long as it was based upon a genuine distinction. The court was unable to find any justification for treating club liquor license holders different from hotel and restaurant liquor license holders. The court remanded the action to the Board for a determination as to whether the holder was unable to reactivate its license due to circumstances beyond its control.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case to the Board for a determination as to whether or not circumstances beyond the holder's control prevented the reactivation of its license, and, if so, to renew the license.</SPAN></P>
