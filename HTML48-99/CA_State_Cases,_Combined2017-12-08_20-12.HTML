</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The membership discount house offered new automobiles for sale to its members at reduced rates. The Department notified the house that it would need a motor vehicle dealer's license to sell cars. After the Department denied the application for a license, the house filed a Cal.  Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 1094.5 petition for a writ of mandate to review the denial. The trial court granted the petition. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment granting the writ of mandate directing the Department to set aside its denial of the license. The court held that the Department's grounds for denial of the license were legally insufficient because the discount house was a bona fide dealer within the meaning of the California Vehicle Code. The court found that the discount house was a bona fide dealer because the legislature had set forth an extremely broad definition of the term &quot;dealer&quot; in the vehicle code and the dominant concern of the scheme was to protect the public from irresponsible and unscrupulous persons in the sale of automobiles. The court found that the discount house was not lacking in the qualities of honesty and reliability with which the statute concerned itself.</SPAN></P>

The state failed to demonstrate that the error was harmless to defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. The statement concerned the conduct of defendant on the night of the killing. The witness was the only person who gave testimony as to the events immediately preceding the killing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and the jury returned the death penalty. Defendant contended that his statements to the police officers were improperly admitted into evidence because he received no constitutional warning. Defendant also argued that he was denied a speedy trial. In addition, defendant asserted that the exclusion of prospective jurors was contrary to standards required in death penalty cases. The court affirmed the defendant's conviction for first degree murder because, although the warnings that were given were arguably technically insufficient, the introduction of the statements was harmless error, where the statements did not constitute a confession and their introduction was not prejudicial. The court also determined that, in the absence of actual prejudice, defendant cannot complain that he was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial. The court, however, reversed the imposition of the death penalty because the questions put to two of the jurors excused for cause and the jurors' responses presented reasonable doubt just what their positions were with respect to imposing the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's case was remanded for retrial in habeas corpus proceedings with respect to the penalty phase only. The jury entered a death sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that it was not reversible error to allow challenge for cause to jurors who had general objections to or expressed conscientious or religious objections to the death penalty because the voir dire conducted demonstrated that the challenged jurors unequivocally stated they could not vote for the death penalty under any circumstances. The court found that defendant could not argue that he unfairly testified on his own behalf because he thought his incriminating statements to police would be introduced. The court finally held that defendant could not argue that admission of witness testimony in the form of deposition denied him his right to confrontation when his counsel previously stipulated to such admission. The court noted that defendant could have sought to exclude the testimony on the grounds that the witnesses were not unavailable under Cal. Evid. Code &sect;&sect; 1200, 1291, 240, or requested a continuance until the sick witnesses could testify under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1050.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actions to declare Lab. Code, &sect; 1850, unconstitutional or otherwise invalid and to recover certain penalties paid for the alleged violations of the section.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Affirmed in part and reversed in part.  Judgments for plaintiffs affirmed in part and reversed in part.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State of California sought review of summary judgments from the Superior Court of San Diego County (California) in favor of plaintiffs, contractors on public works, in their actions to declare Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 1850&nbsp;unconstitutional or otherwise invalid and to recover penalties paid for the alleged violations of the section.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">These cases involved a challenge to Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 1850, which basically prohibited the employment of aliens on public works. The court held that &sect; 1850 and related sections could not stand. The discrimination involved denied arbitrarily to certain persons, merely because of their status as aliens, the right to pursue an otherwise lawful occupation. The classification within the statutory scheme operated irrationally without reference to any legitimate state interest except that of favoring United States citizens over citizens of other countries. This latter objective did not reflect such a compelling state interest that it would permit the court to sustain this kind of discrimination. Because &sect; 1850 offended the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, that section was declared to be void. To the extent that it conflicted with its present holding, the court overruled its decision in City of Pasadena v. Charleville, 215 Cal. 384, 10 P.2d 745 (1932), and specifically rejected the language that &quot;the right of any legislative body in this state to prohibit the employment of alien Chinese on public works may not be questioned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed summary judgments for plaintiffs, contractors on public works, insofar as they voided sections of the California Labor Code for encroaching upon the congressional scheme for immigration and naturalization and offending the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and affirmed an award of damages for penalties assessed under the sections against the Division of Highways of the State Department of Public Works.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the conviction for first degree murder of a police officer and the imposition of the death sentence. The court first found that the trial court properly instructed the jury regarding the first degree murder charge because the evidence clearly pointed to commission of the homicide in the perpetration of another felony. The court also concluded that defendant was not harmed by the trial court's corrective set of jury instructions. Nor was the marital privilege violated by the admission of witness testimony. The privilege could not be asserted because defendant's marriage to the witness was void. The court further held that tape recorded statements defendant made to undercover police were admissible, even though no Miranda warnings were given, because they were not made during custodial interrogation. Finally, the court ruled that there was sufficient evidence to uphold the trial court's exclusion of 13 members of the jury venire because their statements made it clear that they would vote against the imposition of capital punishment without regard to evidence, and that their death penalty views prevented them from impartially deciding defendant's guilt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to assault with a deadly weapon on a correctional officer. The court affirmed and found that the trial court excused for cause three prospective jurors because of their opposition to the death penalty. The court further found that two of the excused prospective jurors had made equivocal and ambiguous statements regarding their ability to impose the death penalty and that it was not unmistakably clear that these jurors would have automatically voted against the imposition of capital punishment without regard to any evidence that might have been developed at the trial. The court held that these jurors were improperly excused. The court further held that the trial court's instructions adequately informed the jury of the consequences of a verdict of life imprisonment, that to subject defendant to the death penalty for an assault that did not result in the death of the victim did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment upon him, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting defendant's request that he be allowed to represent himself, and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to offer defendant a new attorney.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The real parties in interest in an action against the department were uninsured drivers of vehicles which were involved in accidents. The department sent a notice to each driver to either post security as required by Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 16020 or risk suspension of driving license under Cal. Veh. Code &sect;&sect; 16080 and 16100. Each driver failed to post the security requested, and the department ordered that the driver's license of each be suspended. Based upon a petition for prohibition and mandate by the drivers, the department filed a petition for a writ of prohibition to restrain the court from taking further action. The court denied the writ, holding that before ordering suspension of the license of a driver involved in an accident the department should have determined whether there was a reasonable possibility that a judgment may be recovered against the driver, and so should have considered culpability. The court determined that an order suspending the license was subject to court review and that no undue burden would appear in requiring the department to consider the question of culpability in determining the reasonable possibility of a judgment for damages against the driver.</SPAN></P>

The officer obtained a key to the apartment from the apartment manager and entered the apartment unannounced and seized heroin in the apartment. The lower court convicted defendant of possession of heroin and of possession of heroin for sale, and the court reversed. The court noted that a case dealing with the validity of unannounced entries had been decided after defendant's trial and that the record was unclear as to the reasons for the unannounced entry. Therefore, a reversal was required to clarify the record. However, the court held that there was probable cause for defendant's arrest prior to the police officer's entry because the police officer had the right to use a public vantage point to peer through defendant's window.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner claimed that the NAEA acted without having received any reports that he engaged in misconduct on release, and that it was within the NAEA's discretion to allow other types of monitoring. The court denied petitioner's request for writ of habeas corpus. The court held that the NAEA had construed Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 3152 to mean that outpatient drug testing was mandatory, and that any reference to the NAEA's discretion in &sect; 3152 should be read to pertain to an addict's return to the CRC. The court found that a report was made to the NAEA, and that &sect; 3152 did not require that the reports reveal any particular misdeed by an outpatient, but rather &sect; 3152 was satisfied if the reports conveyed information from which the NAEA could reasonably conclude that return to the CRC was in the best interests of the addict and society.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner alleged that the ordinance, which required registration of all firearms within the city, was unconstitutional because, inter alia, it conflicted directly with state laws that regulated firearms and violated the federal right to bear arms. The court denied the writ of mandate because the ordinance was a valid exercise of local police power which was not in direct conflict with state laws or impliedly preempted by state laws concerning weapons, and it violated no provision of the United States or state Constitutions. The court held that the penal code prohibited licenses or permits, but it did not prohibit registration requirements, and the city registration requirement did not conflict with the permit and licensing provision. The statutes could not reasonably be said to show a general scheme for the regulation of the subject of gun registration, and there was no basis for a conclusion that there was a legislative intent to make the subject of gun registration immune from local regulation.</SPAN></P>

The court found that counsel's withdrawal of a question was a permissible trial tactic, that the omitted jury instruction did not withdraw a possible defense, and that counsel failed to call a witness because she was not material to his defense. The court held that absent a showing that justice would be served had defendant's request to argue before the jury been granted, the lower court did not abuse its discretion.

Once the district's existence was established, either de facto or de jure, it followed that the taxpayer, as a private person, was not able to contest the validity of the proceedings that led to its formation.

Penal Code &sect; 484b.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of violating Cal. Penal Code &sect; 484b for failing to use construction funds for the payment of laborers and materialmen on a construction project. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 494b and the sufficiency of the evidence against him. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, concluding that &sect; 484b was not so indefinite as to violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. A reasonable construction of &sect; 484b was that a reduction in equity or in security required a showing of a valid lien right by one who furnished services or materials to the job. Thus, it was sufficiently certain what conduct was prohibited. Defendant's conduct became criminal once the diversion of funds caused harm to the person providing them. Nor did Cal. Penal Code &sect; 484b conflict with Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 15's prohibition against imprisonment for debts. The diversion of funds dealt unfairly with and prejudiced the rights of homeowners, which fell within the fraud exception to Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 15. Finally, sufficient evidence supported defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that other offenses not charged in the information were properly admitted in the penalty phase of the trial because those offenses were established by sufficiently corroborated evidence, that the jury was promptly and fully admonished as to effectively cure any harmful results of the prosecutor's remarks, and that the superior court correctly refused to give a Morse instruction because such charge would have confused the jury.

At trial, the trial court admitted the juvenile's confession into evidence despite the juvenile's protests that he never voluntarily waived his right to silence because no parent, attorney, or interested adult was present when he consented to confess. The trial court applied a preponderance of the evidence standard of proof and found the juvenile guilty of involuntary manslaughter. On review, the court held that the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof set forth in Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 701 was not &quot;clearly, positively, and unmistakably&quot; constitutional. The court held that the juvenile's conduct displayed a reckless disregard of human life and amply supported a finding of involuntary manslaughter.

Penal Code &sect;&sect; 834a and 243 as applied to his allegedly unlawful arrest. Defendant was arrested when an officer, investigating a report of a prowler, accosted him based on a cursory description of the suspected prowler. After the officer told defendant he was under arrest, a violent struggle ensued. Defendant contended that his arrest was unlawful for lack of probable cause, and therefore his resistance was justified. The court affirmed that, while a person could not use force to resist arrest, lawful or unlawful, reasonable force was allowed in defense against excessive force. Where an arrest was proven to be unlawful, a defendant could be convicted only of a misdemeanor. The court therefore reversed defendant's conviction because the jury was not so instructed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) that committed him to a state institution for narcotic addiction, pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 3100 et seq., after a finding that he was in imminent danger of becoming addicted to narcotics.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that certain evidence was the result of an illegal search and should have been excluded. The court agreed and reversed the order of commitment. The court held that the exclusionary rule was applicable to narcotics addiction proceedings explaining that while such a proceeding may be labelled civil, there was a close identity to the aims and objectives of criminal law enforcement, and that to hold unconstitutionally obtained evidence admissible in the proceedings would furnish an incentive to violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The court concluded that the officers were not justified in detaining and questioning defendant merely because the area was one where narcotic transactions had taken place in the past and defendant appeared nervous at seeing the officers' car. As such, the court concluded that the evidence obtained when in the course of the questioning defendant permitted the officers to inspect his arm was not admissible. The court then deemed the testimony of the physician that examined defendant after his arrest inadmissible as &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners sought habeas corpus relief to have their death sentences declared invalid, on the grounds that it was improper to excuse for cause veniremen conscientiously opposed to the death penalty were unconstitutional because they gave the jury unguided discretion to impose death or life imprisonment, the death penalty constituted cruel and unusual punishment, and petitioners were denied their right to counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court determined that petitioners' failure to object to the exclusion of the prospective jurors in question did not bar them from claiming error as a result of an intervening change in law. The United States Supreme Court ruled that a sentence of death could not be carried out if the jury that imposed or recommended it was chosen by excluding veniremen for cause simply because they voiced general objections to the death penalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction. The court determined that the broad language of the Supreme Court's opinion established without doubt that in no case could respondents be put to death where a venireman was excused for cause solely on the ground he was conscientiously opposed to the death penalty. Reversal was automatically required if a venireman was improperly excused for cause on the basis of his opposition to the death penalty. The court upheld the constitutionality of Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 190 and 190.1 and the constitutionality of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the dance was protected by U.S. Const. amend. I until it was shown to be obscene, which required a showing that the dance affronted current community standards.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner agreed to buy a truck tractor from the creditor but defaulted in his payments. The creditor brought an action against him for recovery of the truck or damages, invoking the remedy of claim and delivery.

The creditor then invoked the remedy of mesne civil arrest and bail under Cal.  Code Civ. Proc.  &sect;&sect; 478- 504. The sheriff arrested the civil arrestee. He spent five weeks in jail with no opportunity to appear in the lower court to seek release from detention.

Petitioners brought an action challenging the schedules as violative of the First Amendment. The court annulled the Public Utilities Commission's approval of the tariff schedules. The court found that the First Amendment protected the right to be anonymous and that any impairment on that right must be justified by a compelling state interest. The court determined that even erroneous statements made by the recorded messages were entitled to constitutional protection. The tariff was not justified by the telephone company's fears that callers would assume that it sponsored the message. The telephone company was unable to provide a public utility function that necessitated identification by its subscribers. Finally, the court held that 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 317(a)(2), which required identification of persons that furnished political material to broadcasting stations, was not analogous to the tariff schedules.</SPAN></P>

The lower court overruled the demurrers and the theater managers pleaded not guilty to the charges. They sought a writ of prohibition to restrain the lower court from proceeding with the trial. The court held that (1) the theater managers had standing to challenge the ordinance without first applying for a license and having the application rejected, (2) it was constitutionally permissible for the municipality to impose reasonable regulations upon the theater, however, (3) the ordinance was overly broad; it did not provide precise standards capable of objective measurement and thus vested the city officials with unlimited discretionary power to grant or refuse permits and thereby effectively impose a censorship or previous restraint upon the theater managers' constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 404.6 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court rejected the argument that the statute exempted labor organizations in violation of equal protection, explaining that a common sense construction of the statute subjected both union and nonunion persons alike to criminal punishment, and the second paragraph merely declared the legislature's intent. The court observed that, when possible, statutes were to be given a reasonable interpretation that rendered them valid and operative. The court found that the statute was not impermissibly broad because it provided adequate warning of what constituted a penal offense. The court explained that the word &quot;urge&quot; was of common usage and the proscribed urging occurred at the point where the speaker uttered the words to urge violent or forcible acts. The court found that the statute's inclusion of the phrase &quot;clear and present danger&quot; was not vague because the courts had long used such language to distinguish between permissible limitations on speech and those that ran afoul of constitutional guarantees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The arresting officers had received a telephone call that defendant and another individual were arranging sales of heroin. One officer got in touch with defendant's parole officer and both suspect's had failed to report. Defendant's parole was suspended, and an all points bulletin was issued for his arrest. The officers then went to defendant's house to arrest him for the parole violation. The officers quickly entered the house and accosted defendant. Just before they arrested defendant they passed a girl and told her they were police officers but did not announce their purpose before entry into the house. The court held that the officers' failure to explain their purpose and demand admittance as required by Cal. Penal Code &sect; 844 vitiated the arrest. The court reasoned that the conviction required reversal as the officers' identification to the girl did not constitute substantial compliance with &sect; 844. The court found that the prosecution did not discharge its burden of establishing the legality of the entry, and the fact that defendant was a parole violator did not excuse noncompliance with &sect; 844.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners challenged the condemnation of three instead of two parcels of land on the ground that taking property for such a purely economic purpose violated the Cal.

The court held that it was sound economy for the state to take the entire parcel to minimize ultimate costs and under the circumstances, excess condemnation was constitutional. The court held that when the property was not needed for the physical construction of the public improvement, the question of public use turned on a determination of whether the taking was justified to avoid excessive severance or consequential damages. The court held that if it was determined that the excess condemnation was not justified, the court must find that it was not for a public use.</SPAN></P>

The picketers sought review of the superior court's denial of their application for a writ of habeas corpus, in which they had alleged that they were illegally restrained of their liberty because the order was void and unenforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The temporary restraining order was issued to prevent striking and mass picketing against the county by the social workers union and related individuals. The picketers were private citizens in no way affiliated with the union, county, or welfare department when they picketed before a county building. The court held that (1) the order was unconstitutionally overbroad in that it unnecessarily restricted the exercise of First Amendment rights as peaceful picketing was an activity subject to absolute constitutional protection in the absence of a valid state interest justifying limitation or restriction, which the county had not shown; (2) the order was too vague and uncertain to satisfy the requirements of notice and fair trial which were inherent in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as the description of the group to which the proscription applied was indefinite; (3) the doctrine of severability of the order was inapplicable; and (4) the order was therefore void in its entirety because an order constitutionally void on its face was issued in excess of the superior court's jurisdiction and could not sustain a contempt judgment based on its violation.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the oath forbade membership in organizations that advocated the overthrow of the state or federal government and that this language was unconstitutionally overbroad because the oath could only constitutionally forbid membership when the member oathtaker held the specific intent to further the group's unlawful aims. The court rejected the county's suggestion that the court read that limitation into the oath because there was no ambiguity in the language that would allow the court, in effect, to rewrite the oath.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the lower court's grant of summary judgment, enjoining the county from spending public money to administer the unconstitutional part of the oath to public employees. The court determined that the oath's second paragraph, proscribing membership in any group that advocated overthrowing the government, was unconstitutionally broad because the proscription can only extend to a specific intent to further the group's unlawful aims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An order to show cause was issued to consider the inmate's claim that his underlying conviction for the violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288 was open to collateral attack upon his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The inmate alleged that at the preliminary examination preceding of his initial conviction, he was not apprised of his right to counsel pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 859. The court discharged the order to show cause and denied the writ of habeas corpus. The inmate's petition lacked merit because he did not move to set aside the information, and he thereby waived his statutory right to question the legality of his commitment. The court further held that even had the inmate moved to set aside the information, his failure to pursue the issue on appeal would have barred consideration in the collateral proceeding. Moreover, the court held that although the inmate should have been certified to the superior court for hearing and examination on whether he was a mentally disordered sex offender following his second conviction, the failure to observe correct statutory procedures in postconviction proceedings did not render an underlying judgment of conviction unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The war protesters, who were leafleting a train station, were found guilty of violating &sect; 421.11.1, on the ground that they were in the station without any business with a carrier and hence were loitering within the meaning of the ordinance. Petitioners contended that the ordinance unconstitutionally abridged their right of free speech under U.S. Const. amend. I. The court granted a writ of mandamus and ordered that petitioners be discharged from custody. The court ruled that the railway station was like a public street or park and that noise and commotion were characteristics of the normal operation of the station. The court found that the railroads sought neither privacy within nor exclusive possession of the station, as such, they could not invoke the law of trespass against petitioners to protect those interests. The court held that petitioners' activities did not interfere with the use of the station. As such, because of the overbreadth of coverage of the ordinance, the language prohibiting presence in a terminal longer than reasonably necessary to conduct business with a carrier was unconstitutional and petitioners' convictions could not stand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1961, the California legislature divided the state into 38 congressional districts pursuant to Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 27, which required congressional districts to consist of either whole counties, whole assembly districts, or combinations thereof. As a result, many of the districts departed substantially from the ideal populations of one thirty-eighth of the state's total population. The court had denied a previous request for a writ of mandate for reapportionment due to time constraints that would have come into play had reapportionment been ordered in time for the 1966 elections. However, the legislature failed to enact a measure for reapportionment by the close of its regular 1967 session. Respondents asserted that practical difficulties prevented them from altering voting districts in accord with the 1960 census. The court did not grant a writ of mandate but asked the legislature to adopt a reapportionment plan and held that if it failed to do so by December 7, 1967, the court would adopt a plan of its own. In reaching this decision, the court noted that the difficulties resulting from reapportioning did not justify perpetuating an unconstitutional apportionment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Orange County (California), which convicted him by jury of assault with intent to commit murder, being armed at the time with a pistol capable of being concealed upon the person without having a license to carry the pistol, and assault with a deadly weapon upon the person of a police officer. The information also charged him with having a prior felony conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district attorney made a motion before sentencing to strike the allegations of the deadly weapons section, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022. The court found that the trial court's abortive attempt to reflect in the information and judgment the ambiguous motion had resulted in a judgment and record so confused and uncertain as to render meaningful analysis impossible. The court concluded that the state of the record, together with the fact that the trial court's action represented a purported exercise of discretionary powers as to sentencing, precluded present modification or correction by the court. The court held that the allegations made by defendant in support of his motion to strike the prior conviction were sufficient to justify a hearing for the purpose of determining whether, in the proceedings leading to that conviction, he was accorded his right to counsel in accordance with the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. The court concluded that if the prior conviction was determined to be invalid, then there was a reasonable possibility that erroneous impeachment of defendant's testimonial credibility by the prior conviction materially influenced the jury in arriving at its verdicts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause for further proceedings under the directions and in conformity with the views expressed in its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The police officers watched the arrestees' film from the audience and determined the film was an exhibition of obscene matter. Without obtaining a search warrant or a prior judicial determination of obscenity, the police officers initiated an arrest and seized the film. After the arrestees were charged with exhibiting obscene matter, the arrestees filed a motion for return of the film. When the municipal court denied the motion, the arrestees filed a complaint for a writ of mandate, praying that the municipal court be ordered to direct the films return. Thereafter, the superior court denied the writ, and upon review, the court reversed. After finding that a writ of mandate would lie to compel the return of property illegally seized without a warrant, the court held the film's seizure had been invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments because a search warrant was required prior to any search for or seizure of allegedly obscene material, even if the search was contemporaneous with an arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent accepted a social invitation from defendant driver to ride in his car. The driver failed to negotiate a sharp curve on a private road and an accident resulting in the decedent's death occurred. Plaintiffs brought a wrongful death action. The trial court refused to give instructions on negligence, ruled that the California Guest Law, Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 17158 applied, and instructed the jury that plaintiffs could recover only upon a finding of willful misconduct. The jury returned a verdict for defendants and this appeal ensued. The court found the guest law was inapplicable to an accident on a private roadway, as distinguished from a public highway. There was no rational basis to construe the guest law, as urged by defendants, to mean that it was to be applied when part of the ride was on a public highway, but the negligent injury was inflicted on private property. Since the California Guest Law was inapplicable to the driver's negligence, which occurred on a private road, improper instructions were delivered to the jury. That error required reversal of the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant one contended that his convictions and death sentence should be reversed because they rested upon confessions obtained in violation of his constitutional rights and that under Cal.

The court held that the trier of fact properly found that defendant one gave a voluntary confession. The court held further that the record did not lack support for the conclusion that, although fully informed of his rights, defendant one waived his rights and confessed voluntarily. In addition, the court held that defendant one's commission of a series of robberies did not constitute &quot;a single course of conduct,&quot; and, therefore, &sect; 654 did not apply. In regard to defendant two, the court held that it could not conclude that the identifications of defendant two were so impeached, inherently improbable, or physically impossible as to render them unworthy of belief. However, the court held that the trial court erred in failing to order a separate trial and that this error prejudiced defendant two.</SPAN></P>

The court found that although the wife was not prosecuted for the offense, she was entitled to be advised of her rights before being subjected to police questioning. The information elicited not only implicated defendant but also implicated both accomplices. The court found that the evidence could not be used against them.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant asserted, inter alia, that the prosecution improperly suggested that, if he were found not guilty by reason of insanity, he would be &quot;set free,&quot; that the prosecution erroneously commented on his failure to take the stand, and that the prosecutor's improper references to defendant's first two trials infected the guilt and penalty trials with reversible error. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court reasoned that the prosecutor's statement that if defendant were found insane at the time he committed the offense, he would be &quot;turned loose,&quot; was obvious misconduct. However, the court found that it could not hold that the misconduct constituted reversible error because defendant rendered the matter moot by waiving his right to a sanity trial. The court concluded that the prosecution's comments on defendant's silence were improper but did not require a new trial under the test of harmless constitutional error. The court reasoned that a timely objection would have prevented the prosecutor's most harmful comments about the previous trials from ever reaching the jury and that under such circumstances an objection could not be made for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An appeal as of right was taken from a superior court judgment after a jury found defendant guilty of crimes, including first degree murder, and imposed the death penalty. During the trial, defendant interrupted the proceedings with comments and curses and was ordered gagged. Defendant's counsel moved the court to suspend the trial pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1368 for a hearing on present sanity, offering an affidavit, then testimony, from a licensed psychologist, concluding that defendant was insane. The trial court denied the motion, and declined to reconsider after a psychiatrist, relying instead on the opinions of four court-appointed psychiatrists later offered similar testimony. The court reversed, holding that due process required a full hearing when a substantial doubt was raised regarding defendant's present sanity. The court found the psychologist's opinion met this standard as a matter of law, regardless of any opinion to the contrary, and that the taking of his testimony did not constitute the &quot;hearing&quot; required under &sect; 1368. The court found the failure to conduct a hearing under these circumstances was per se prejudicial and reversible error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were charged with armed robbery of a liquor store. The court found that criminal procedure rules created by a November 12, 1965 decision applied because defendants were on appeal after that date even though their cases were tried earlier. In affirming one conviction, the court held that the first defendant offered to confess twice. The second time, police simply said, &quot;Go ahead,&quot; and defendant gave a full confession. The court held that although it was error for the court to hear both defendants' confessions during the trial, defendant's conviction was not prejudiced because it stood on his properly admissible and amply corroborated confession alone. In reversing the second defendant's conviction, the court held that his confession came from interrogations designed to elicit incriminating statements. The court found that the second defendant initially denied the crime, but after what police called a &quot;short conversation,&quot; defendant finally confessed. The court found no record of the so-called &quot;short conversation&quot; which overcame the second defendant's reluctance to confess and held that the prosecution failed to meet its burden that the confession was obtained properly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's armed robbery conviction as to one defendant and reversed the conviction as to the other defendant on the ground that the confession was elicited by unconstitutional methods.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer initiated unannounced early-morning searches of the homes of county welfare recipients for the purpose of detecting the presence of &quot;unauthorized males.&quot; When directed to participate in the operation, the social worker submitted a letter stating that he could not participate because the searches were illegal. He was discharged for insubordination. The court held that the warrantless searches by the employer transgressed constitutional limitations because the evidence sought would have afforded a basis for criminal prosecution. There was no probable cause to search the targeted residences, and no effective voluntary consent for the searches was possible upon consideration of the relationship of the employer, a welfare provider, to the recipients. The employer also failed to demonstrate that the scope of the raids was closely related to the achievement of a legitimate end. The court held there were alternate means of detecting welfare fraud that were less subversive of the recipients' constitutional rights. The court held that in light of the social worker's knowledge of the projected operation, he had adequate grounds for declining to participate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner surviving relatives, all residents of Romania, sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which was in favor of objector state as to the surviving relatives' action to determine heirship rights of nonresident aliens. That court had refused to enforce the decedent's will and accordingly permitted the state to escheat the estate to itself.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state had sought to escheat the decedent's estate on the grounds that the law of Romania applicable at the date of death did not accord to United States citizens a reciprocal right to take property upon the same terms and conditions as its nationals, a requirement imposed by Cal. Prob. Code &sect; 259. On appeal, the court held that the surviving relatives, in fact, had established the reciprocity required by &sect; 259 and that the trial judge erred in deciding that it could not honor the decedent's wishes. The court accordingly reversed, noting that Romania, much like the Soviet Union, did allow United States citizens to inherit economically significant property on terms of full equality with its own citizens and residents. The court further found that although Romania law imposed temporary restrictions upon the right of United States citizens to remove inheritance proceeds from Romania, such restrictions were not fatal to the reciprocity required by &sect; 259. Thus, as the statutes interposed no barrier to right of Californians to leave their estates to citizens and residents of Romania, the trial judge had erred in denying that right.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed. The court rejected the officer's contention that he could dismiss the doctor without regard to his constitutional rights. While the court noted that the officer had broad discretion to determine which provisional employees he might have retained, the court also noted that it had the power and duty to review the dismissal of a provisional or probationary employee in circumstances that suggested a constitutional violation. Additionally, the court rejected the officer's argument that the doctor had not exhausted his administrative remedies.

The court held that not every intentional violation of the law was not grounds for excluding an individual from membership in the legal profession and that the question of whether an individual was fit to practice law turned upon whether he had committed or was likely to commit acts of moral turpitude. The court held that the nature of the acts with which applicant had been involved were not acts of moral turpitude and that they bore no direct relationship with his fitness to practice law.

The promotion of temperance in the consumption of alcoholic beverages and of orderly conditions in their marketing constituted proper legislative objectives. The legislation was reasonably related to that legitimate objective. The ABC Act did not unlawfully delegate legislative power by enabling each producer and wholesaler to set the price below which a retailer could not sell its product.  Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 24755.1 did not preclude the imposition of the penalties of license suspension and revocation rendered against the retailer as that statute, enacted after the licenses were suspended, applied only prospectively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the law enforcement agency notified the company that the operator of the club which made predictions of the fastest racehorses was using the club's telephone service for the unlawful purposes of illegal bookmaking activity, the company disconnected that service. The operator brought a complaint requesting that the commission repeal its decision 41415 as providing an unconstitutional rule and that the commission should modify its decision 63178, which held that the evidence was insufficient to prove that the operator used the telephone facilities for an illegal purpose. The court annulled the commission's decision 69510 because its rule of decision 41415 involved a constitutional infirmity, although its defect could be cured by a proper amendment of the rule. The court found no rule of universal application on an individual's right to present his views at a hearing before the institution of action affecting his substantial rights. The court recognized the agency's interest in immediate disconnections. The court, however, found that decision 41415 would adversely effect legal businesses and deprive telephone customers of state and federal constitutional rights to free speech.</SPAN></P>

The court also concluded that defendant should have only been convicted and sentenced for one felony charge. The court found that reversal was needed as to one of the convictions, and the reversal of the judgment regarding the second count did not entitle him to a release from prison.

Code &sect; 6001 et seq., as prohibited by the import-export and commerce clauses of the United States Constitution. The trial court upheld the tax as constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court concluded that the sales tax on bunker fuel oil was a constitutional tax levied upon a subject related to, but nevertheless distinct and separable from, articles of export, and it did not violate the import-export clause of the federal constitution. The state did not violate the commerce clause by its general imposition of a non-discriminatory sales tax upon the fuel purchases made locally for the purposes of consumption in ships engaged in interstate commerce. The tax was similar to the state's permissible taxation of fuel sold to airplanes used in interstate commerce.

The court held that Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 26, upon which the landlord relied for the declaration of his rights, was, in its entirety, an unconstitutional infringement of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The Fourteenth Amendment, through the equal protection clause, proscribed discrimination based on race where directly practiced by a state and also if practiced by private persons where to some significant extent the state in any of its manifestations had been found to have become involved in it. The prohibited involvement occurred when a state court enforced the racial discriminatory act of a private individual relating to occupancy of residential real property in cases where affirmative relief was sought in aid or furtherance of the discrimination.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted respondents' motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court reversed on appeal, concluding that Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 26 did not conform to U.S. Const. amend. XIV and was therefore void. The court determined that Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 26 provided a purported constitutional right to privately discriminate on grounds that were unavailable under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court found that state action was sufficiently involved because the state took action through its legislature to change its laws to permit private discriminatory practices that were previously restricted. Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 26 was void in its entirety because the right to discriminate was fully integrated, and thus the severability clause did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of a drug-related offense and committed to a state rehabilitation center. While there, defendant was charged with, and pleaded guilty to, possessing heroin in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11500. A writ of habeas corpus was issued.

Defendant was again committed to the center after the trial court suspended the proceedings. After his second commitment, defendant successfully obtained a writ of habeas corpus. Defendant was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings; it sentenced defendant to prison. Defendant appealed after the appellate court affirmed. He asserted that the sentence constituted double punishment for the same offense in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 654, that he had served his sentence through his prior confinement at the center, and that that he was denied equal protection. In affirming, the court modified but adopted the appellate court's opinion. Defendant's commitment for treatment at the center was not a penal sentence. He did not suffer double punishment when he was subsequently sentenced to prison for heroin possession, and his time spent in the center did not constitute time served on a prison sentence. No equal protection violation occurred.  Cal. Penal Code &sect; 2900.1 merely offered an incentive for addicts to complete their treatment; defendant was treated similarly to all addicts who rejected the offered help.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoner was convicted of robbery in Texas and sentenced to a term of five years.

The prisoner then filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus with the court, requesting his unconditional release from custody or to be transferred to the custody of the State of Texas in order to serve his California sentences and a prior Texas sentence concurrently. The court concluded that the prisoner's convictions were valid, but granted the writ of habeas corpus for the sole purpose of transferring the prisoner to the custody of Texas. The court held that the California trial courts had jurisdiction over the prisoner, as the prisoner entered California of his own volition; and that Cal.

The Superior Court of Sacramento County (California) held that the Act violated U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV as well as Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The secretary appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the effective date of the Free Television Act (Act), which banned the business of home subscription television in the state of California, the secretary refused to file the incorporators' articles of incorporation on the grounds that the corporation proposed to engage in an unlawful business. The trial court held that the Act abridged the free speech guarantees of the California and U.S. Constitutions. The court held that communication by television fell within First Amendment protection. The court further held that the Act amounted to total censorship, in advance, because it banned transmission when a charge was made to home viewers and that restriction of such an unlimited potential scope could be imposed only to avoid a clear and present danger of a substantive evil. However, even if true, the Act's statements that development of the subscription television business would have an adverse effect upon existing television stations, would tend to deprive viewers of their freedom of choice, or would tend to create a monopoly, did not demonstrate any clear and present danger of a substantive evil. Any suggested evil was, furthermore, well discounted by improbability.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of Kern County (California) found that the hotel was a public nuisance. The hotel owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The hotel owner was given notice by the city that his hotel did not conform to the city building code. The hotel owner claimed that he was financially unable to accomplish the required repairs and modifications. Over the course of several years, the city made repeated requests of the hotel owner that he comply with the city's ordinance, but the hotel owner failed to take any action with the exception of improving a fire escape. The hotel owner did not deny that the ordinance had been violated but contended that the city exceeded its legislative powers by declaring as a matter of law that the violations constituted a public nuisance. The court held that the city had the power to define by statute the standards by which courts were to judge whether a nuisance existed. The court rejected the hotel owner's contention that state housing requirements had preempted the field of regulation. Finally, the court found no constitutional violation occurred by applying the standards of fire safety incorporated in the code to buildings constructed prior to the code's enactment.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, after the inmate had served greater than the maximum sentence that he could have served had his sentence not been enhanced, the inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus that sought his release from custody. The court denied the inmate's petition. The court held that Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11721 was unconstitutional only to the extent that it purported to constitute the status of narcotics addiction as a crime. The court also held that although &sect; 11721 did not contain a severability clause, the unconstitutional portion of the statute was severable from the remainder of the statute. The court found that there was limited information from the record regarding the previous conviction under &sect; 11721. The court ruled that there was a presumption of regularity to the judgment, which placed the burden upon the inmate to prove that his conviction was not based on the constitutional portion of the statute. The court concluded that the inmate failed to satisfy his burden.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The assessor maintained that because &sect; 20811 limited its operation to school districts in counties with a population exceeding 4 million, it constituted special legislation in violation of the 10th, 28th, and 33rd clauses of Cal.

The court directed the assessor to provide the requested information in the future, holding that: 1) although the time for performance by the assessor of the duties prescribed by &sect; 20811 had long since expired for the fiscal year, the basic issues presented were not moot because the obligation to provide the information recurred annually; 2) the court could not say, as it would be required to do in order to hold &sect; 20811&nbsp;unconstitutional, that no state of facts could reasonably be conceived to justify the classification made; 3) the fact that the assessor might not be able to comply with &sect; 20811 in one comparatively minor respect did not compel invalidation of the section in its entirety; and 4) because the section required the assessor to provide only an estimate of assessed valuation, it did not seem unreasonable to assume that a meaningful estimate of the succeeding year's values could be made by the middle of May.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the writ as moot with regard to the fiscal year, but directed the assessor to comply with the statute by supplying the information in response to future requests by the districts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, prison inmate, brought a petition for habeas corpus. He had been convicted of sales of marijuana in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11531 and was also convicted under the same section in a prior felony conviction. The court questioned whether, if prior to finality of a judgment of conviction, the statute under which petitioner was charged and convicted was amended so as to decrease the punishment, the petitioner was entitled to the benefits of the amendatory statute. The court held that he was, if that were the only point involved in the instant case. But it was not the only point involved. Here, the amendatory statute only in a limited sense ameliorated the punishment. In a very real and practical sense it increased the penalty. Since the amendment, considered as a whole, increased the penalty it could not be applied to petitioner without violating the constitutional inhibition against ex post facto legislation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, cl. 3. The court held that, as applied to petitioner, when considered realistically and as a whole, the amendatory statute increased the punishment, and so could not be made applicable to petitioner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate was convicted of escape without force or violence in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 4530. At the time of his escape, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 3044 provided that no person convicted of an escape could be paroled until he had served at least two calendar years from and after the date of his return to the prison after such conviction. Several months after the act of escape was committed, these two sections were amended to reduce the penalties formerly provided. The court held that since the amendatory statute lessening punishment became effective prior to the date the judgment of conviction became final, it, and not the old statute in effect when the prohibited act was committed, should have been applied. The court stated that when the legislature amended a statute, which lessened the punishment, it had determined that its former penalty was too severe and that a lighter punishment was proper. The court ordered that the Adult Authority fix petitioner's sentence as provided in the amended statute and determine his eligibility for parole accordingly, but denied petitioner's writ because he was not entitled to release.</SPAN></P>

When the officers located the husband, marijuana was found in his vehicle. The husband and wife appealed their convictions for the illegal sale and possession of marijuana and conspiracy. The court affirmed and held that the search of the house was substantially contemporaneous with the wife's lawful arrest. The officers had probable cause to force the door open after they complied with Cal. Penal Code &sect; 844. The search of the car was lawful as well because the husband consented to it. Evidence was sufficient to show an agreement between the husband, the wife, and the third party to sell marijuana and overt acts in furtherance of that agreement.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court determined that statements that defendant made to police officers about his possession and use of the billy club should not have been admitted, because defendant was not informed of his right to counsel.

The court rejected defendant's argument that officers did not discover the billy by means of an illegal entry because the court determined that warrantless entry into defendant's automobile was sustained by extraordinary and exceptional circumstances. Furthermore, the court determined that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12020 was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff contractor filed for bankruptcy. Defendant license board suspended plaintiff's license pursuant to Cal.

Plaintiff sought an order to reinstate plaintiff's license. Plaintiff's request was granted and defendant appealed. The court reversed and held that Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 7113.5 was not unconstitutional and that defendant did not abuse its discretion when it imposed the penalty on plaintiff. Section 7113.5 constituted a proper exercise of the state's police power because plaintiff's bankruptcy related to his license. The penalty was designed to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the public. There was no abuse of discretion in imposing the penalty because it applied to a selected group of creditors who were injured by plaintiff's operation, and there was high public interest in protecting them and making them whole. The penalties required plaintiff to pay pension, health, welfare, and vacation funds that were due to plaintiff's employees at the time plaintiff filed bankruptcy. The payments were preferred claims in bankruptcy.</SPAN></P>

The inmate argued that his constitutional rights were violated by admission into evidence of statements he made before he was advised of his right to counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that when the inmate had been arrested and the police had undertaken a process of interrogation that lent itself to eliciting incriminating statements, the accusatory or critical stage had been reached and the inmate was entitled to counsel. The court held that because the inmate was questioned during the accusatory stage, when he had not been advised of his rights to counsel and to remain silent, the statements should not have been admitted into his trial. The court held that because a court appointed psychiatrist questioned the inmate during the critical stage without the presence of counsel, admission of the psychiatrist's testimony that the inmate admitted guilt was a violation of the inmate's constitutional rights. However, the court held that neither of these violations was so prejudicial as to require reversal. The court granted the writ of habeas corpus to the inmate regarding the penalty phase of the trial and reversed the judgment of the death penalty because the trial court instructed the jury that it could consider that a prisoner serving a life sentence could be paroled.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court then held that each house of a bicameral state legislature had to be apportioned on a population basis. At the time, actions were pending in federal district court regarding reapportionment of the legislature. The court took jurisdiction of the cases; the Supreme Court then determined that the state senate was malapportioned, and the court held that departures in the assembly were large enough to deny equal protection. No explanation existed for giving the City and County of San Francisco five instead of four assemblymen. The court in ordering reapportionment adhered to existing county and assembly district boundaries and refrained from drawing any new lines dividing counties or districts.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a consolidated case, petitioner employer, a city, sought review of two awards of the Industrial Accident Commission (California), which awarded workmen's compensation benefits to respondent pension recipients (recipients), who were a former employee and a widow. The commission held that an estoppel barred the employer's reliance upon Cal. Lab. Code &sect;&sect; 5405 and/or 5406 and refused to allow the employer any credit for the pensions paid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">One of the recipients, a former employee, suffered an injury while on duty as a city fireman for the employer. The employer paid the former employee his full salary for the year following the injury; after that it paid him a disability pension. The statute of limitations, Cal. Lab. Code, &sect; 5405 would have barred the former employee's claim unless the employer was estopped to assert the statute. Another recipient, the widow of a deceased fireman, received a widow's pension from the employer.  Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 5406 would have barred the widow's claim unless the employer was estopped to assert the statute of limitations. City officials, who were assumed to have been authorized agents of the employer, told the recipients that because they received pensions, their filing of claims for workmen's compensation benefits would be useless. The court held that the awards of workmen's compensation benefits to the recipients were annulled. The mere fact that the employer gave erroneous advice did not in itself estop it from asserting the statute of limitations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, an Illinois insurance company doing business in California, was assessed a retaliatory tax and paid the tax under protest. Illinois would have taxed a California insurer that did business in Illinois at a greater rate than an Illinois insurer and the tax assessed against plaintiff by defendant was lower than what the Illinois tax on plaintiff would have been.  Cal. Ins. Code &sect;&sect; 685- 685.3 imposed retaliatory taxes upon foreign insurers whenever their home states imposed taxes on similar California insurers higher than California assessed those states' insurers. Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 14 4/5, subd. (e), allowed plaintiff to deduct from the gross premium tax the amount of real property taxed paid in California and was not violated by &sect;&sect; 685-685.3. Hypothesizing an unconstitutional application of the statute did not save plaintiff from its actual constitutional operation. The statute was properly applied to a company of the discriminating state and the restricted coverage did not show that the future use of the statute would become uncertain, nor would such limited coverage violate the statute's legislative design. Judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Lower court's judgment that retaliatory tax did not violated the California Constitution was affirmed since its constitutionality could not be attacked by hypothetical scenarios; the tax was properly applied to an insurer of a discriminating state and there was no evidence that the future application of the tax would have become uncertain.</SPAN></P>

The accomplices claimed that they were not aware of the principal's actions in the store where the robbery and murder took place as they waited outside in their car. The court found that the trial court erred in admitting the extrajudicial statements of the defendants made during police interrogation while the defendants were under arrest because none of the defendants were warned of their right to counsel or their right to remain silent. Furthermore, where the statements of the principal defendant amounted to a confession and where the statements of the accomplices were the only evidence offered to prove their guilt, admission of the statements was prejudicial and required reversal. The court also found that the two accomplices were deprived of their right to a speedy trial because the prosecution's desire to try all three defendants together in order to strengthen the case against the accomplices, which necessitated extradition of the principal defendant, was not good cause for the delay. Violation of these defendants' speedy trial rights required dismissal of the prosecutions against them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him of driving while addicted to a narcotic drug. The court dealt with the definition of the term &quot;addicted&quot; in &sect; 23105, and found that the trial court erred in its formulation of the term. The court reversed and remanded the cause for a determination of whether the defendant was &quot;addicted&quot; to the use of narcotics. The court concluded that the trial judge used the improper &quot;habitual use&quot; test in finding defendant addicted to the use of narcotics. The court ordered the trial court to determination of whether defendant exhibited the three characteristics of the addiction process: (1) emotional dependence on the drug, (2) an increased tolerance to its effects, and (3) physical dependence manifested by withdrawal symptoms upon sudden termination of drug intake. The court believed that when an individual reached the point that his body reacted physically to the termination of drug administration, he had become &quot;addicted&quot; within the meaning and purpose of &sect; 23105.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">This case concerned the operation and constitutionality of California's quasi-community property scheme. The court reviewed the trial court's interlocutory decree of divorce and the record on appeal and held that: 1.) Because the divorce was granted on the ground of adultery, and it was the property of the adulterous spouse that was being divided as the court deemed just, no valid constitutional objection could be raised; 2.) Changes in the community property system which affect &quot;vested interests&quot; could not constitutionally be applied retroactively but must be limited to prospective application; 3.) It could not be successfully argued that the quasi-community property legislation was unconstitutional because of a violation of the due process clause of the federal Constitution; and 4.) The state's inherent sovereign power included the so called &quot;police power&quot; right to interfere with vested property rights whenever reasonably necessary to the protection of the health, safety, morals, and general well being of the people.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A defendant was charged with first degree murder for the killing of two girls with a sledgehammer. At trial, the defendant raised an insanity defense. Upon a jury verdict, the trial court convicted the defendant of two counts of first degree murder, determined that he was sane at the time of the crimes, and imposed the death penalty. On an automatic appeal pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1249(b), the court reversed and remanded for a new trial. Specifically, the court held that the trial court erred in admitting damaging statements made by the defendant during a custodial interrogation before he was formally charged, but after he was denied an opportunity to speak with his lawyer. In particular, the court found that all of the Escobedo conditions had been met and that it was immaterial that the defendant had spoken with his lawyer several hours before the interrogation. Finally, the court rejected the defendant's argument that the comment rule on a defendant's silence at trial under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 and Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At a joint trial, defendant and a co-defendant were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death.

The court explained that because the justification of the requirement of the right to counsel at the accusatory stage was the prospective purpose of benefiting the overall system of criminal administration by drying up the sources of coercion, no purpose would be served by applying the judicial decisions retroactively. The court, however, concluded that defendant and co-defendant were entitled to new penalty phase hearings because the instruction as to the possible release on parole invited speculative argument to the jury.</SPAN></P>

Here, defendant had the constitutional protection of an absolute right to remain silent; the prosecution could not introduce into evidence defendant's confession unless that right of silence were waived.

The court found that (1) the presence of an element of degree in the definition of a person in imminent danger of becoming addicted to narcotics did not render the statutory language insufficiently certain for due process, (2) while it was insufficient for an individual to have merely begun to experiment with drugs, it was not necessary that defendant actually be addicted in order for the statutory provisions at issue to apply to him, and (3) Cal. Penal Code &sect; 6500 et seq. did not give jurisdiction to entertain commitment proceedings where the statutory provisions for such commitment were not satisfied, insofar as commitment after conviction was not statutorily permitted and there was no express authority for commitment under the circumstances at issue.</SPAN></P>

The prisoner also failed to demonstrate that he did not have an opportunity at trial to present the alleged truth of the matter related to the perjured testimony. Finally, the prisoner raised three additional issues pertaining to the sufficiency of the evidence, the suppression of evidence favorable to the prisoner, and failure to appoint trial counsel, which the court denied because these issues had already been decided by the prisoner's first appeal.</SPAN></P>

The contestant filed an answer opposing the decree. The trial court ruled in favor of the newspaper. On review, the court affirmed. For many years prior to the enactment of legislation defining a newspaper of general circulation, the newspaper conducted its operations in the township, then unincorporated, in a manner entitling it to be a newspaper of general circulation, and it continued to operate in such a manner. The newspaper continued to be qualified as a newspaper of general circulation after the definition was changed because Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 6006 provided an exemption. Thereafter, a proviso was added to &sect; 6006 which resulted in the newspaper losing its status. However, the proviso was eliminated two years later. The newspaper should not be prohibited from relying on an exemption for the sole reason that during some intervening period of time in the past it did not meet another requirement added by the legislature and subsequently eliminated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were arrested for violations of Long Beach, Cal., Mun. Code &sect; 4140.7, in that they had been playing for money, within the city limits, a game of chance played with cards, known as panguingui. Assuming that panguingui was a game of chance, it was one of the games prohibited by the ordinance, but was not a &quot;banking or percentage game,&quot; as that phrase was used in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 330. Defendants attacked the ordinance on the dual grounds that: (1) the phrase &quot;game of chance&quot; was so vague as to render the ordinance invalid, and (2) it was unconstitutional and void because the state Legislature preempted the field of gambling. However, as the ordinance set forth in clear terms what type of game was prohibited, and under what circumstances, it was not void for uncertainty or vagueness. By limiting the general statutes to regulation or prohibition of specifically enumerated activities, the Legislature had not intended to prevent local authority from legislating on those subjects in regard to which the former were silent. Therefore, the state had not occupied the entire gaming field to the extent that the general laws conflicted with an ordinance that regulated games of chance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reasoned that no valid objection to the constitutionality of a statute under the due process clause could properly arise if it was reasonably related to promoting the public health, safety, comfort, and welfare, and if the means adopted to accomplish that promotion were reasonably appropriate to the purpose. The court concluded that such a statute was presumed to have been constitutional; and it must have been deemed to have been enacted on the basis of any state of facts supporting it that reasonably could have been conceived. Accordingly, the court reasoned that the burden was on the party challenging the statute to show that the legislative choice was palpably excluded from any consideration whatever by the legislative body; that it was palpably arbitrary and beyond rational doubt erroneous; that, in short, there was no rational basis whatever for the statute. The court affirmed the judgment upholding the constitutionality, holding that the individual did not make any such showing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction and from the nonappealable order denying his motion for a new trial. The court treated his appeal as one from the order granting probation and reversed the grant of probation with directions. The court held that the prosecutor was advised prior to the convening of the grand jury that defendant would claim constitutional privilege regarding any questions presented, but that the prosecutor asked questions knowingly placing defendant in a dilemma not contemplated by the law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district voted a hospital into existence; however, the bond issue to finance the building of the hospital fell short of the two-thirds approval necessary for adoption. The district then attempted to enter into a &quot;lease-back&quot; arrangement whereby a nonprofit corporation would build the hospital, the district would lease the facility, the project would be financed by bonds and possibly taxes, and the title to the facility would eventually vest in the district. The taxpayer filed an action against the district and the leasing company to have the lease declared void and to have the district enjoined from levying any tax to carry out the lease agreement. The district and the leasing company requested a writ of prohibition to restrain the superior court from taking any further steps in the taxpayer's action, even though the district and the leasing company prevailed at the trial level in that action. In granting the writ, the court concluded that to leave the matter for possible correction on an appeal would be too late, would render that remedy inadequate, and would result in a failure of justice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the writ, finding that relief by way of prohibition was necessary to prevent the frustration of a remedial statutory purpose and the defeat of a valid project for public health and safety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with the murder of his mother and pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. The jury found defendant legally sane and defendant was convicted of first-degree murder. Defendant appealed. One issue on appeal was whether the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict of sanity. The court reviewed the record to determine whether there was substantial evidence to support the jury's verdict of sanity. The court held that the conduct and declarations of defendant, which occurred within a reasonable time before and after the commission of the act, were admissible as proof of defendant's mental condition at the time of the offense. The court determined there was substantial evidence to support the verdict of sanity at the time of the murder because defendant walked steadily and calmly, spoke clearly and coherently, and appeared to be fully conscious of what he was doing at all times.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict of sanity and that the lower court gave proper insanity instructions, but modified the judgment by reducing the degree of the crime to murder in the second degree.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff claimants brought an action against defendant lender to recover the amount claimed from a construction loan fund by a bonded stop notice. The lender filed a cross-action for a declaration of rights of all unpaid materialmen. The Superior Court of Fresno County (California) held that the claimants were entitled to recover from the lender, with equal priority and with priority over all other claims. The lender appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lender contended that the stop-notice claims should not have been allowed because Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1190.1(h) provided for an equitable garnishment of construction-loan funds. On appeal, the court held that the evidence did not support the finding that the claimants were entitled to equitable liens on the loan funds. There was no evidence of any reliance on the loan funds or of any inducement to so rely. The funds earmarked for construction purposes were to be used to pay suppliers of labor and materials who filed claims under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1190.1(h) and superseded any private contract arrangements of the borrower and the lender. The claimants' right to payment arose not simply upon their giving notice of their claims, but upon compliance with Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1197.1. The lender's withholding of the funds until the claimants established their claims was not in breach of its obligations but was in compliance with the statutory requirements. The lender's liability for the stop-notice claims was limited to the amount of the fund against which the claims were asserted and the lender was not personally liable for interest before judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order of the trial court was affirmed in part and reversed in part.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were convicted of violating &sect; 11500 despite the fact that they used peyote in a Navajo religious ceremony. The court reversed defendants' convictions and held that defendants' First Amendment rights had been infringed upon. Specifically, &sect; 11500 imposed a serious burden on the free exercise of defendants' religion, given that peyote played a central role in the ceremony and practice of the Native American Church. Moreover, the State demonstrated no compelling interest that necessitated an abridgement of defendants' First Amendment rights. Contrary to the State's assertions, peyote was not used in place of medical care or given to small children. The State presented no evidence that fraudulent claims of religious immunity would preclude effective enforcement of narcotics laws. Finally, defendants' belief in peyotism was honest and in good faith. Based on the foregoing, defendants' convictions were reversed.</SPAN></P>

In the underlying action, the business owner sought to prevent the highway patrol from issuing parking citations under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 22502 to customer's vehicles parked in front of his place of business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The business owner obtained a preliminary injunction restraining the highway patrol from issuing parking citations under &sect; 22502 against patrons of his business who had parked their northbound vehicles on the left side of the highway, in front of his place of business. The court held that although the businessman had standing to challenge the application of &sect; 22502, the highway patrol had properly applied the section. The court explained that the owner of a business could enjoin the enforcement of an unconstitutional or void statute or ordinance that deprived him of effective access to his customers. However, the highway patrol's interpretation of &sect; 22502 was reasonable under the circumstances. Under the businessman's interpretation, which would have allowed parallel parking on the left if parking on the right was unavailable, patrolmen and highway users would be left without clear standards for determining when right-hand parallel parking was precluded, and dangerous highway hazards could have resulted. The court recognized the weight of the expert judgment of the highway patrol in applying &sect; 22505.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the highway patrol's peremptory writ of prohibition restraining the lower court from proceeding with an action to enjoin the highway patrol from enforcing a section of the vehicle code.</SPAN></P>

The court held that although the orderly administration of justice required defendant to raise the matter of indigence in conjunction with his request for a free transcript, to deny him relief upon the ground that he did not file an affidavit in forma pauperis when he requested the transcript would result in undue hardship, as he did not have the guidance of any statute, rule of court, or decision setting forth the such requirement.

The court found that the overbreadth and uncertainty of the part of the &sect; 41 invoked against the civil servant could not be eliminated by the severance of language, and the only way in which a limitation of &sect; 41 to a proper scope could be attempted was by reading into it numerous qualifications and exceptions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant registrar of voters appealed a decision by the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which held that Cal. Elec.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The municipal court judges asserted that &sect; 25304 was contrary to the provision in Cal. Const. art. VI, &sect; 11 that municipal court judges should be elected by the qualified electors of the district. The court stated that &sect; 11 also declared that, except as such matters were otherwise provided in Cal. Const. art. VI, the legislature should provide the manner in which municipal court judges should be elected or appointed, and Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 25304 related to the manner of the election. The fact that the procedure devised by the legislature required electors who were interested to take the initiative if the electors wished the incumbent's name to be on the ballot did not impose an unreasonable burden upon them. In view of the comparatively small number of electors' signatures required to place the incumbent's name on the ballot, it was apparent that if there was sufficient opposition to the incumbent to have any significant effect at all, there would be no difficulty in obtaining the necessary signatures. The procedures set forth in &sect; 25304 were reasonably designed to accomplish the legitimate purposes of the statute. Thus, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The complaints in the five actions attacked the proceedings of defendant agency, the city, and the council leading up to the adoption of the ordinance approving the final redevelopment plan. The court concluded that the trial court correctly determined that the redevelopment plan should be upheld as not an abuse of discretion, and that the judgments to that effect should be affirmed, with the exception of the award of costs against plaintiffs.

The trial court denied the motion to disqualify on the ground that the contempt proceeding was a continuation of the original action. The court held that although the issues presented in the contempt proceeding were not identical in every particular to the issues previously submitted to the judge, the issue of whether the husband in fact violated the judge's orders was a matter necessarily relevant and material to the issues involved in the original action. The court held that the trial judge was in the best position to pass upon the questions involved. The court held that in domestic relations cases in particular, the contempt function was one of enforcement of the court's orders and the court could not permit a device intended for spare and protective use to be converted into a weapon of offense. The court concluded that the contempt proceeding was a continuation of the original domestic relations action, and that the trial court properly denied the husband's motion under &sect; 170.6.</SPAN></P>

After ten months of treatment, defendant was paroled. Defendant filed an application for writ of habeas corpus. The court denied the petition for habeas corpus. The court determined defendant was not entitled to immediate release from his parole on the ground that he was no longer an addict, where the purpose behind parole was rehabilitation and the need of further followup was necessary if a relapse occurred. The court found that certain conditions of defendant's parole that provided for the deprivation of civil rights were improper because defendant was not sentenced as a felon and had been civilly committed. The court held a provision under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 6451 that did not allow for a defendant to demand a jury trial was invalid, but that defendant was not entitled to discharge from his parole where his remedy was an opportunity to demand a jury trial on the issue of his narcotic addiction as of the time of his commitment.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the action was barred by Cal. Veh.

The court rejected the owner's contention that the statute did not apply to her because she had given compensation for the trip, noting that the statute's language showed no intention to except an owner who had given compensation for a ride. Neither was the court persuaded by the owner's argument that the section was unconstitutional because it made an unreasonable distinction between owners and non-owners who gave compensation, noting that legislation was presumed constitutional unless it was palpably arbitrary and beyond rational doubt erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff widow of a deceased fireman brought an action for declaratory relief as to her entitlement to a widow's pension from defendant city, and defendant former wife brought a cross-action regarding the same pension. The Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) held in favor of the widow and awarded her interest on accrued pension benefits withheld by the city pending the award of the pension.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The former wife was married to the deceased city employee during the time of his employment with the city. The couple was thereafter divorced and the pension had been declared community property; however, no division was made of it. The employee remarried after retirement and died while still married to the widow. The court agreed with the trial court that the widow was the &quot;widow&quot; of the deceased employee within the meaning of that term as it was used in the city charter. The court rejected the former wife's attempt to analogize the situation to one involving life insurance proceeds generated from premiums that were paid for with community property. The court also concluded that it was vital for the city to retain some flexibility and control over pension rights and that such control would have been lost if third parties such as the former wife could have obtained vested interests in such pensions. The court further held that Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3287 supported an award of interest to the widow.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the widow and upheld the award of interest payable to her on withheld accrued pension benefits.</SPAN></P>

IV, &sect; 6 insofar as it related to apportionment of senatorial districts, invidiously discriminated against voters living in heavily populated counties and violated the Equal Protection Clause. The court concluded that, whether or not &sect; 6 was invalid, respondents did not have the power to reapportion the districts. The court concluded that under &sect; 6, the power of the commission to act was expressly conditioned upon the failure of the legislature to reapportion the assembly and senatorial districts at the first regular session following each decennial federal census. The court found that the legislature did not fail to act, but that it enacted a complete reapportionment plan. The court stated that in the event that the plan was held invalid by judicial decision, the legislature, under a reasonable construction of &sect; 6, was entitled to an opportunity to adopt a plan that met the requirements of the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, corporation and union member, brought an action in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) against defendant City of Los Angeles for declaration of rights and obligations under statutes relating to the right of firefighters to join a bona fide labor organization and for an injunction to restrain the city from discriminating against firefighters who were union members.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found the statutes to be unconstitutional and inapplicable to defendant city by reason of its status as a chartered city and denied plaintiffs an injunction. The court found: (1) the plain meaning of both the Labor Code and the Government Code provisions was that unions may organize to represent their members and that an action at law on behalf of such members was one form of such representation; (2) there was a triable issue of fact as to whether there was a reasonable probability that defendant would have continued its discriminatory activities and threat of future action could only have been inferred from that which occurred in the past; (3) a statute which affected only firefighters was not in violation of the provisions of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 21 as a grant of special privilege or immunity because the classification was not arbitrary and was based upon some difference that had a substantial relation to the purpose of the legislation; and (4) the Labor Code provisions and the Government Code provisions were applicable to the City of Los Angeles because the state legislature was attempting to deal with labor relations on a statewide basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner owned a 2.2-acre parcel of land, which she wanted to develop by building garden apartments. The property was situated in a residential area and subject to zoning restrictions, which fixed the minimum lot-size requirement at one acre, and limited the use to a single dwelling. However, most of the surrounding lots were much smaller. The town had repeatedly rejected the property owner's petitions to build the apartments. The property owner argued that because the one-acre restriction was not enforceable as to her property, the single dwelling restriction could not be either. The court held that while the ordinance that imposed a one-acre lot restriction could not properly apply to property which was virtually surrounded by parcels of lesser size, it could restrict the use of the property to a single-family dwelling because that usage was the predominant characteristic of the property in the general area. The ordinances were severable and enforceable. Because the reasonableness of the single-family restriction was fairly debatable, based on the town's interest in maintaining the character of the town, the court did not disturb the decision of the town.</SPAN></P>

Civ. Code pt. 3. tit. 7. The Superior Court of Santa Cruz County (California) denied the utility company's motion to dismiss the eminent domain proceeding as unconstitutional. The utility company then sought a writ of prohibition to restrain the respondent trial court from proceeding with the condemnation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The utility company contended that Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1249 was unconstitutional as applied to public utilities and that in being so there was no method provided by the law for allowing compensation for compulsory improvements made after the date of the summons and that the trial court had no constitutional power to devise a method for such allowance. Therefore, the utility company argued that the trial court was without jurisdiction to proceed on the eminent domain action. The court found that 1) the application of &sect; 1249 to public utility company condemnations was unconstitutional; 2) the trial court properly devised a procedure whereby the value of the utility company's property was to be valued as of the date of trial, rather than the date of summons; 3) the utility company's right to prohibition was not perfected because the company's challenge to the trial court's jurisdiction was inadequate; and 4) the utility company's interests were properly protected in the event that the water district did not have sufficient funds to adequately compensate the utility company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found lying in an intoxicated condition on a private driveway exposed to public view and was convicted of violating a city ordinance. The court granted defendant a writ of habeas corpus. The court held that it was improper to prosecute defendant under the city ordinance. The court found that the city ordinance was void because the legislature adopted a general scheme for the regulation of the criminal aspects of being intoxicated in a public place under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 647(f), which provided that a person was guilty of a misdemeanor if found in any public place under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The court determined that it was immaterial to decide here whether a driveway was a &quot;public place&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 647(f) because it was a place exposed to public view. The court also found, based on other provisions of the penal code, that the legislature by implication provided that intoxication in a place that was not a public place but was exposed to public view should not be criminal. Accordingly, the city ordinance attempting to make certain acts pertaining to intoxication in a public place criminal was in conflict with the state law and was void.</SPAN></P>

Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11501 did not prohibit an offer to sell a narcotic when the drug was not delivered. The court held that delivery was not an essential element of the crime alleged; however, the trial instruction was in error because the intent to make a sale was necessary for a conviction under &sect; 11501. Here, the jury could have reasonably concluded from the evidence that defendant had not intention of selling the drugs to the agent; thus, he was not subject to the same penalties imposed by &sect; 11501.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer arrested defendant after locating coins in a sock while searching the car in which defendant was riding pursuant to the investigation of an area robbery that had occurred 20 minutes before the search. The car had been proceeding erratically, and the police officer thought the driver's physical characteristics and attire matched the description of the robber. The court found, contrary to the State's contention of reasonable cause for arrest and justifiable search, that the officer did not have reasonable cause to arrest the driver because there could have been more than one man in the area matching the description, the robbery occurred 20 minutes prior to the stop, the driver was driving toward the robbery scene as opposed to away from it, and the officer had no information that the robber had an automobile or a confederate. Although the officer had cause to stop the car for investigation pursuant to its erratic course, the court affirmed dismissal of the information, ruling that once a reasonable explanation was given (that the occupants were unfamiliar with the area and were lost), the officer lacked further cause to arrest the driver or search the automobile.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an automatic appeal pursuant to Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the guilty verdict on the murder and kidnapping charges and the jury's finding of sanity, noting that the fact defendant testified he thought his acts were justified at most created a conflict in the evidence, and did not prove insanity. The court rejected as meritless defendant's speedy trial claim as well as his contention that he properly moved to disqualify the judge, finding that none of the stated reasons for disqualification was sufficient to establish the requisite bias and prejudice. Furthermore, the failure of the trial judge to appoint counsel for the self-representing defendant was not in error, as defendant had no absolute right to the services of an attorney in a purely advisory capacity. The court accordingly affirmed, holding that the trial judge had had the legal right to seek expert assistance to inform him as to the mental condition of defendant before he was required to express whether he had the &quot;doubt&quot; as to that condition, as that term was used in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1368.</SPAN></P>

The citizen claimed that &sect; 4430.30's prohibition against the use of stationary sound trucks impinged the First Amendment right to free speech by preventing the publication of grievances against certain employers. The court held that because the use of the sound truck provided an effective means of communication, it fell within the constitutional protection of free speech. However, its use was also subject to specific regulation of its ill effects on the safety and tranquility of the public. The court found that &sect; 4430.30's blanket prohibition against the use of a stationary sound truck exceeded its justification. The prohibition was not limited to the elimination of loud or raucous noise nor was it necessary for the prevention of traffic hazards. A complete message could not be conveyed by a moving truck. The ordinance's absolute obstruction of the use of the sound truck to convey a complete message was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the board's &quot;revised procedure&quot; simply reenacted the language of &sect; 16565, choosing to ignore the fact that the board was limited by the appropriate provisions of the state and federal constitutions and prior case law. The court noted that the board made no attempt at all to avoid the constitutional defects held to exist in the state legislation or to recognize the limitations placed on its regulations by the court. It therefore granted the application for mandamus and ordered that a peremptory writ of mandate issue, directing the board to act on the application without answer to the questionnaire.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The writ was granted. The court held that the board's regulations were unconstitutional, noting that it had already addressed this once. A peremptory writ of mandate issued, directing the board to act on the applications for use of the high school auditorium without requiring an answer to the questionnaire.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board denied the organization's application to use the school's auditorium on ground that the organization refused to file a statement of information as prescribed by Los Angeles, Cal., Bd. of Educ.

The organization refused to sign the statement and filed suit, questioning whether the board had the legal right to make compliance with the rule a prerequisite to an otherwise lawful use of the school premises. The court denied the writ, holding that Rule 1316 was not invalid. The rule was not the type of prior restraint ordinarily referred to as an unconstitutional limitation upon freedom of speech or assembly. That the board had both the right and duty to predetermine that school premises would not be used in contravention of the law was found in the board's general power to hold, maintain, and use the property for educational purposes and in the specific provisions of the Civic Center Act, Cal. Educ. Code &sect;&sect; 16551-16566. Los Angeles, Cal., Bd. of Educ. R. 1316 did not subvert the presumption of innocence or invert the burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

There was mutuality in the contract, and the court found that the bonds issued to fund the completion of the water project were lawful and did not make the contract invalid.

Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11721 by the unlawful use of and addiction to narcotics, and as an alternative to sentencing was committed to an institution under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 6450 as a narcotic addict. Petitioner applied for a writ of habeas corpus and the court denied his request. The court found that no judgment of conviction had been entered, that petitioner was not being held under any penal sanction, and that he was being restrained involuntarily for compulsory treatment and rehabilitation. The court found that petitioner was not imprisoned as a criminal but was held as a sick person and that it was a permissible exercise of the state's power to regulate narcotic drug traffic. The court found that the facility in which petitioner was detained was not a prison. The court held that the legislature's choice of the figure of six months for the minimum period of confinement did not appear to be unreasonable and that despite the five-year maximum, the term of confinement was essentially still for an indeterminate period.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was injured by a third party while working as a state highway patrolman.

The trial court awarded the system a lien in an amount equal to the sum the system had already paid the employee pursuant to his disability retirement. Both the employee and the system appealed, and the court reversed the holding and remanded the cause. The court found that Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) on an information charging him with possession of a narcotic (heroin) in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11500. The trial court also found to be true the charge that defendant had been convicted of violating the same section in 1955. Thus, probation was denied and defendant was sentenced to an increased term as a second offender. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the power to dismiss charges was vested exclusively in the courts by Cal. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1 and art. III, &sect; 1, and that Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11718 was therefore invalid. The court found that the charge of a prior conviction in the present case had not been dismissed pursuant to legislative authority. The trial court found that the charge was true and it was therefore bound to impose the sentence prescribed by law. The trial court could no more dismiss this charge without statutory authority than it could dismiss a charge against any defendant convicted of murder, arson, rape or any other crime. The court determined that to dismiss the charges in the face of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11718, however, was a flagrant usurpation of legislative power. Such would have exalted form over substance to hold that broad constitutional principles of separation of powers and due process of law permitted vesting complete discretion in the prosecutor before the case began, but denied him all such discretion once the information was filed.</SPAN></P>

Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 382 by plaintiffs, holders of deeds of trust, against defendants, financial institutions and related entities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners and plaintiffs were holders of trust deeds that were individually granted to more than 2,000 individuals in an investment scheme by defendant financial institutions wherein each investor was promised a 10 percent return on his investment. The grantor of the deeds of trust went bankrupt and the notes secured by the deeds of trust were defaulted. Plaintiffs filed an action on behalf of themselves and all other owners of trust deeds to recover on the notes. Petitioners objected to plaintiff's prosecution of the class action, and the trial court overruled their objections. On review, the court granted plaintiff's demurrer and denied petitioner's writ petitions. The court ruled that plaintiff's class foreclosure action was valid under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 382 and that a community of interest existed because all notes and trust deeds were identical save for amounts, and each parcel was part of the same tract of land. The court found that the same defenses could be asserted against all trust deed holders and that petitioners were not denied due process because all members were ascertainable and would be provided an opportunity to argue for redress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied petitioners' writs challenging plaintiffs' class foreclosure action and granted plaintiffs' demurrer because the class action represented a community of interest where all the notes and deeds were identical except for amounts, each parcel was part of the same tract of land, and all holders were provided with notice.</SPAN></P>

Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 9547.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board required the business owner under &sect; 9547 to file a surety bond after receiving evidence that numerous liens were filed against the business owner by business creditors. When no bonds were produced, the business owner's dry cleaning license was revoked. The trial court upheld the board's decision, but the court reversed on appeal, holding that although &sect; 9547 was not unconstitutionally vague and did not unconstitutionally delegate legislative power to the board, the regulations enacted by the board impermissibly enlarged the scope of persons protected by &sect; 9547. Under the wording of the enabling statutes regarding the regulation of the dry cleaning industry, the purpose was to protect only customers, rather than to protect suppliers or other creditors of a licensee. The small allowable recovery indicated only customers were to be protected for the loss of clothing. Since the regulation purported to provide coverage for creditors as well as customers, it was invalid. Thus, the terms of the bond demanded by the board to benefit general creditors was invalid, and the judgment was reversed with directions to order the board to set aside its decision revoking the license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence in support of the prisoner's convictions was that, in each case, she went from her living room to her bedroom in her own home for the purpose of having sexual intercourse with a male to whom she was not married, in violation of &sect; 41.07. The court held that the state had adopted a general scheme for the regulation of the criminal aspects of sexual activity and determined, to the exclusion of local legislation, when sexual intercourse between persons not married to each other was criminal. The penal code sections of the state law covering this area were so extensive in their scope that they clearly showed that the legislature intended to adopt a general scheme for the regulation of this subject. The court found, therefore, that the legislature had determined by implication that the prisoner's conduct was not criminal in California. Thus, &sect; 41.07, which attempted to make sexual intercourse between persons not married to each other criminal, was in conflict with state law and was void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The excavating company owned a large parcel of land which was bordered by a rock and gravel excavation site on one side and residential property on others. The land was zoned for agricultural and residential use, with rock and gravel excavation being specifically excluded. The trial court found on behalf of the City. On appeal, the court determined that the trial court did not err in its findings and conclusions. The land was not useful as agricultural or residential land, because the soil was of poor quality and the land was subject to flooding. However, the exclusion of rock and gravel excavation had a basis in protecting the public health. The air pollution, traffic and other dangers resulting from the excavation would be harmful to the surrounding population, which consisted of a high number of individuals with respiratory ailments. The City's comprehensive zoning program was constitutional. An exercise of police powers such as zoning did not constitute a taking. The zoning was not discriminatory in its operation because there were significant differences in the adjoining land which did operate as a rock and gravel excavation site, and the excavation company's land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed. The adoption by the City of a comprehensive zoning plan looking toward the containment and eventual elimination of nonconforming uses accorded with recognized zoning objectives under well settled legal principles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a prior decision the court held that the doctrine of governmental immunity no longer shielded governmental entities from liability for torts for which their agents were liable.

Stat. ch. 1404, which provided that the doctrine of governmental immunity from tort liability was re-enacted as a rule of decision in the state and applied to causes of action arising before and after its effective date. Section 3 of the act stated that it would expire after the 1963 legislative session. The court held that the 1961 act temporarily suspended the cause of action for personal injuries against the hospital district, but did not destroy it, and was a reasonable exercise of the police power. The prior decision had recognized a new cause of action that imposed considerable financial obligations on governmental agencies and the legislation temporarily suspended enforcement of that right pending further study and legislative action. Absent further legislation, tort claims against governmental entities would be continued and the superior court would be restrained from proceeding further.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 1182(c), only those &quot;standard conditions of labor&quot; which did not affect either wages or hours. The court ruled that deductions for cash shortages not due to an employee's dishonest or wilful act or culpable negligence were properly characterized as standard conditions of labor. The court held that the legislature did not intend that subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) of &sect; 1182 be mutually exclusive. The court held that &sect; 11380 did not violate constitutional due process or equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the writ. On appeal, the court reversed, and held that there was no relationship between the experience requirements of the statute and the legislative effort to correct ethical abuses in the profession.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff teacher filed a petition for mandate, alleging that his dismissal from employment without notice or hearing and the revocation of his teaching credentials were invalid actions. The Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California) entered judgment in favor of the teacher. Defendants, State Board of Education and the Board of Education of the City and County of San Francisco (boards of education), appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1945, the teacher was charged with a misdemeanor, &quot;vagrancy lewd.&quot; After pleading guilty, he was sentenced and paid a fine. In late 1948 to early 1949, the teacher received a general elementary school credential and was employed as a teacher by the San Francisco school district. He acquired tenure and remained a teacher in the district until the date of his dismissal. In 1952, sections were added to the education code, which in general prohibited the employment in public schools of persons convicted of certain sex offenses. Thereafter, the teacher was dismissed and his credentials were revoked due to his 1945 misdemeanor. On appeal, the court held that the new legislation,&nbsp;Cal. Educ. Code &sect;&sect; 13207, 13255, did not apply retrospectively to a person such as the teacher who was convicted of a sex offense prior to the enactment of the legislation. The court ruled that no statute was to be given retroactive effect unless the legislature had expressly so declared. The court found that nothing in either section pointed in the direction of retroactive application and that certainly none of its language constituted an express declaration that the statute was to operate retroactively.</SPAN></P>

The builder's assignors paid the connection charges. The builder brought an action to have the ordinances declared unconstitutional and to have the payments refunded. The trial court declared the ordinances unconstitutional and awarded the builder $ 102,700 paid under the ordinances on the grounds that they were revenue measures and that the city was not authorized to enact them under Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 12. The city filed an appeal, alleging that the ordinances were a valid exercise of the taxing power, authorized by Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 5471, and the police power, authorized by Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11. The court reversed the decision of the trial court. The court determined that the ordinances was a valid exercise of the taxing power and that the builder did not sustain the burden of showing the ordinance, as applied, discriminated against its assignors. The court did not reach the issues of whether the ordinance was a valid exercise of the police power or whether formal protests were necessary to recover the payments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In support of its application for a writ, the carrier argued that the accident victims' motion for inspection should have been denied because there was an insufficient showing of good cause, the statements of the independent witnesses were exempt from discovery by reason of privilege, and that the statements were the work product of the litigant or its attorney, and were therefore exempt. The court ruled that the trial court properly ordered the disclosure of the statements because (1) the accident victims made a sufficient showing of good cause to support the order of the trial court, (2) the mere inadmissibility of the material was not, of itself, a bar to discovery under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 2016(b), (3) the carrier's privilege claim was unavailing because its action in gathering and transmitting the witnesses' statements to its attorney did not create an attorney-client privilege, (4) the carrier's work product claim was likewise unavailing because it did not show that work product was equated with privilege in the state, and it did not show that the reasons underlying the doctrine would have been applicable to the proceeding.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was arrested for kidnapping for purpose of robbery, subjecting victims to bodily harm, robbery, rape, and sex perversion. He pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, but he was convicted and given the death penalty and his motion for a new trial was denied. An automatic appeal was taken. The court affirmed, holding that the evidence as to defendant's sanity at the time he committed the crimes charged could be regarded as conflicting because medical reports indicated that he was hostile and it was difficult to obtain information from him. Defendant's wife testified that her husband underwent periodic spells of physical and sexual cruelty when he would do strange things, such as burning his arms, for which he would later apologize; but, it could not be said that the evidence failed to support the finding that defendant was legally sane when he committed the crimes and at the time of trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, a city and a county, appealed a decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which found in favor of plaintiff foreign airline in its action to recover personal property taxes paid under protest on its airplanes flown exclusively in foreign commerce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The foreign airline used one United States port several times a year for entry into the United States. Its airplanes were registered one-third each in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, where they were taxed. The airplanes engaged exclusively in foreign commerce. The city and the county in the United States levied an apportioned personal property tax on the airplanes for the time that they were at the United States airport. The airline successfully protested and received a refund of its taxes. The court affirmed on appeal, finding no error. The court held that the exclusively federal nature of the field of international commerce required it to apply the &quot;home-port&quot; doctrine, and thus to hold that no jurisdiction save that of domicile had any authority to levy a personal property tax on the airplanes. It did not matter whether the home port actually levied any tax. Under the home-port doctrine, based either on the Commerce Clause or the Due Process Clause, the city and the county had no taxing authority to exercise. Airplanes were similar to ships. The court also found that a treaty with Sweden would, in any event, prevent taxation on the one-third of the airplanes registered there.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) dismissed an action by plaintiff, a race track patron, for an injunction against his future exclusion or forcible ejection by defendants, race track owners, from their race track and denied recovery on the race track patron's cause of action for statutory, general, and special damages for alleged wrongful ejection and assault and battery. The race track patron appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that: (1) because the patron had been convicted of bookmaking, the race track owners were duty-bound under Cal.  Bus. &amp; Prof.  &sect; 19561.5 to eject him; and (2) the patron had become a trespasser upon his refusal to leave the track, and no more force was used in ejecting him than was necessary. The trial court also found that the patron's exclusive remedy respecting future ejection was that provided by section 19561.5 -- an administrative hearing before the racing board. Because the patron had not pursued this remedy, the court dismissed his injunctive cause of action for lack of jurisdiction. The patron urged that section 19561.5 was unconstitutional and that the administrative remedy was inadequate. The court affirmed. The court held that: (1) section 19561.5, which barred only those convicted of crimes directly related to the activities regulated, was based upon a rational classification of persons having a substantial relation to a legitimate legislative objective and therefore was constitutional; and (2) the administrative hearing did not furnish an inadequate remedy merely because the patron could not have qualified for relief under it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The buyers purchased an apartment complex in Nevada. By agreement of the parties, the buyers refinanced their obligations and paid a substantial part of their indebtedness to the seller in exchange for the seller's promise that he would provide in his will that upon his death all their indebtedness to him would be canceled. When the seller died in California, he did not provide for the cancellation of the buyers' balance and the buyers continued to make regular payments under protest. The buyers brought an action against the executrix to have the note cancelled and the property reconveyed to them. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the executrix. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment, reasoning the laws of Nevada applied and that the lower court improperly determined that the parties' contract was subject to the California statute of frauds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court. Protection of the buyers' rights under a valid contract precluded interpreting the general language of the statute of frauds to destroy such rights despite possible applicability of the statute arising from the movement of one or more of the parties across state lines.</SPAN></P>

The court held that because &sect; 383b was patterned on a similar New York statute it was entitled to the same construction given by the New York courts on the meaning of kosher. The court concluded that the reference to every Jewish law and custom had to be construed to include only such Jewish laws and customs that were generally recognized among the orthodox Hebrew religious requirements for the preparation of meat products.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A prisoner was arrested twice for intoxication. Later he appeared in court in an obviously intoxicated condition. His cases were continued, and bail was set for $ 500 per case.

He was granted a continuance to prepare a motion to disqualify the judge but shortly thereafter, was returned to jail in default of bail in the previous two cases, and bail was set at $ 100. The jailer denied the prisoner's request to call a bail bondsman. The prisoner filed a petition for habeas corpus, alleging that his bail was illegally high and that the denial of his request to call a bail bondsman violated his constitutional rights. The court held that the bail pending appeal in the previous two cases was not illegally high because its purpose was to assure a defendant would attend court when required to and also that he would be sober. However, the prisoner was unconstitutionally deprived of his rights under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants claimed that the negligence of appellee's staff caused appellant patient additional injuries. Appellee demurred claiming it was immune from tort liability as it was a state agency exercising a governmental function. The trial court sustained the demurer. The court reversed. It found that the legislature had adopted a statute that allowed the state to sue and be sued and that a similar statute applied to hospital districts such as appellee. The court held that although those statutes have been construed as providing only a waiver from suit and not a waiver of substantive immunity, their continuous reenactment indicated a clear legislative purpose to remove all procedural obstacles when the state was liable. As such, the court held that the rule of governmental immunity from tort liability must be discarded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision to sustain appellee hospital district's demurrer based on immunity from tort liability. The legislative purpose behind continuously reenacting statutes that allowed the state and hospital districts to be sued was clearly to remove all procedural obstacles when the state was liable and therefore the rule of governmental immunity from tort liability was discarded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The union's application was denied by the board because they had refused to furnish the &quot;statement of information&quot; as required by Cal.

The union refused to furnish the prescribed statements primarily on the ground that such test oath requirement abridged both the state and federal constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and assembly under the U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV; Cal. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 9, 10. The union sought a writ of mandate and the court issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing the board to act upon any pending or future application by the union to be allowed to hold a public meeting or meetings at the certain junior high school auditorium without requiring a &quot;statement of information&quot; in the form prescribed by Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 16565. The court held that the power of the board to refuse the use of the school to an applicant upon making the finding required by Cal. Educ.

An assessment exceeding the cost of a proposed improvement, so as to furnish revenue to the city, violated the general principle of equality stated in Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 1. Nor did one of the local ordinances assume to limit or relate a charge for outlet facilities to the cost of the subject improvement. The charges were not fixed with specific reference to the costs. The improvement was not to be of local benefit to the subject assessment district. The city could not be permitted to divert special assessment funds for general taxation purposes.

The court held that: (1) defendant's affidavit of prejudice to disqualify the trial judge contained only conclusions and was thus insufficient; (2) impeachment evidence was properly excluded as defendant failed to lay a proper foundation for introducing a prior inconsistent statement, (3) the deputy's testimony was primary evidence and the tape recording was not the best evidence; (4) evidence of defendant's relationship with his mistress was admissible to establish bias and the limiting instruction was sufficient; (5) an improper comment by the State was harmless; and (6) defendant was not entrapped as there was substantial evidence that the criminal intent originated with defendant given that it was he who first broached the topic of a bribe.</SPAN></P>

The trial court's instructions were to the effect that a conclusive presumption, which no other evidence in the case could contradict, would apply if there were a failure to show that there was not a reasonable possibility of access to mother. The court reversed and held that the court's explanation of the term &quot;cohabiting,&quot; with regard to legal presumptions, was error. The instructions defining the scope of the conclusive presumption were too broad in that &quot;cohabiting,&quot; as used in Cal.  Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 1962(5), should properly have been construed as the living together of a man and woman ostensibly as husband and wife. The result of blood tests were not to be used to controvert the conclusive presumption of paternity, but if the conclusions of all the experts were that the alleged father was not the father, the question of paternity should have been resolved accordingly. Where the tests taken established that mother's husband could not have been the father, the rebuttable presumptions were conclusively rebutted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lessees held leasehold interests in certain lands and improvements owned by the city. The county assessed their leasehold interests without deducting the present worth of rentals for the unexpired terms as allowed by &sect; 107.1 for certain holders of possessory interests on the ground that that &sect; 107.1 was void as inconsistent with the California constitutional requirement that all property be assessed at its full cash value. The lessees paid the assessed taxes under protest and filed an action to recover the disputed amounts, and the trial court, finding that &sect; 107.1 was unconstitutional, entered judgment for the county. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that although the first paragraph of &sect; 107.1 was invalid because it improperly classified leasehold interests in tax-exempt property as personal property within the meaning of Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 14, the elimination of that paragraph in no way disturbed the scheme of taxation set forth in the remainder of Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 107.1.

They submitted a contract to plaintiff that would have required him and his four barber employees to join defendant's organization. Defendants did not represent any of plaintiff's employees and the employees did not wish to join the union or to be represented by defendants. Plaintiff refused to sign the contract, which led to defendants' peaceful picketing in order to secure the union shop agreement. The trial court enjoined defendants from picketing plaintiff's barber shop. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court, finding that peaceful picketing for recognition by a union that does not represent a majority of the employees was not an unfair labor practice. The court found basic to the rights guaranteed to employees under 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 7 to form, join, or assist labor organizations is the right to engage in concerted activities to persuade other employees to join for their mutual aid and protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Four days after his arraignment, petitioner was convicted of vagrancy and for appearing in a public place in an intoxicated condition. Petitioner's motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment were denied. Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus. The court granted certiorari and set aside the convictions. The mere change of the date on which the vagrancy offense was alleged to have been committed did not require the trial court to grant petitioner a continuance. However, petitioner was otherwise deprived of the effective aid of counsel in that the trial court failed to give petitioner at least five days in which to prepare for trial after his plea was entered as required by statute. Further, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 647(11), the vagrancy statute under which petitioner was convicted, was so lacking in its definition of &quot;common drunk&quot; that each defendant was left to the vagaries of individual judges and juries. Thus, the statute was unconstitutional vague, uncertain, and incapable of being uniformly enforced and petitioner was entitled to a discharge from custody by reason of his conviction thereunder.</SPAN></P>

Section 1549.1 authorized the Governor to surrender any person charged in another state upon the demand of the executive authority of that state.  Cal.

On certiorari to the United States Supreme Court, the court's judgment was reversed and remanded. On remand, the court held that the master contract and the member-unit contracts were valid and lawful, and that the trial court's judgment was correct.

On further review, appellee corporate and individual landowners contended that under state law the contracts were invalid and that the districts lacked capacity to enter into the contracts with the federal government. The court held that state law expressly conferred legal capacity upon the districts to enter into contracts with the federal government for project water. The court determined that the districts were not violating their fiduciary duty by entering into contracts with the federal government that contained a 160-acre limitation and noted that the irrigation projects were subject to reasonable federal regulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, a convicted criminal, challenged decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which upheld the constitutionality of respondent city's criminal registration ordinance, Los Angeles, Cal., Municipal Code &sect;&sect; 52.38 to 52.53 (ordinance), in his action for declaratory relief and for an injunction against respondents, a city, its police chief, and a city attorney.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The convicted criminal filed an action for declaratory relief and for an injunction to prevent enforcement of the ordinance. He alleged that the ordinance violated the Due Process Clause, the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and the Equal Protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. He also alleged the ordinance violated Cal. Const. art I, &sect;&sect; 4, 11, 13 and 21 and art. IV, &sect; 25(33). The trial court found the ordinance was constitutional, both on its face and as applied to the convicted criminal. On appeal, the court found the rules related to municipalities' police power under Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11 demonstrated the city was without power to enact the ordinance. The court found that the ordinance conflicted with state law. The state preempted the field of criminal registration by passing sex offender registration statutes that were less extreme than the city's, by passing laws for habitual offenders, and by clearing criminal records. The overall requirement of criminal registration for more than sex offenders placed the ordinance within a field that the state preempted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the finding upholding the constitutionality of the city's criminal registration ordinance and remanded.</SPAN></P>

The license was revoked for a violation of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 24200(e).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A hearing officer found that the licensees' premises were established as a resort for lesbians and homosexuals and determined that grounds were therefore established to revoke the license under &sect; 24200(e) and also that to continue the license would have been contrary to public welfare and morals within the meaning of Cal. Const. art. XX, &sect; 22. The court reversed the judgment with directions. Caselaw interpreting other statutes had held that mere proof of patronage by homosexuals, without proof of the commission of illegal or immoral acts on the premises, was not sufficient to justify revocation of a license. The language of &sect; 24200(e), however, unambiguously made such conduct grounds for revocation and could not be interpreted otherwise. It was therefore unconstitutional. The record did not justify the conclusion that the license's revocation could be justified on constitutional grounds. Although the record included evidence of public displays that manifested sexual desires by patrons of the premises, the revocation was not grounded on that evidence but on the finding that the premises were a resort for homosexuals. That reason was insufficient for revocation of the license.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court judgment that denied the licensees' application for mandamus and directed the trial court to grant a peremptory writ of mandate directing the department to set aside its order revoking the license.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 2099, declared that it was the public policy of the state to reimburse, where possible, persons whose boats, nets, and other fishing equipment were rendered valueless by the anti-netting bill. The court issued the writ, holding that because the appropriation promoted the purposes of the Fish and Game Preservation Fund, which were public in character, there was no violation of Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 31, which prohibited a gift of public funds. Although the Board was not given the express authority to examine and adjust claims after an appropriation had been made, the court found that it was clearly implied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant state department of alcoholic beverage control challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which held that &sect;&sect; 55.5, 55.6, 55.65 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, 1935 Cal. Stat. ch. 330, p. 1123, and Cal. Admin. Code tit. 4, &sect; 99(a), (b), (f), were unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The liquor licensee filed a proceeding in mandamus to challenge a temporary suspension of its license by the department. The trial court held that Cal. Admin. Code tit. 4, &sect; 99(a), (b), (f), and &sect;&sect; 55.5, 55.6, 55.65 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act (act), 1935 Cal.

The department appealed, and the court reversed. The act's purposes, which were to prevent price cutting in the sale of alcoholic beverages and to promote temperance, were proper legislative objectives. The means of effectuating the act's purposes, by having each producer or wholesaler establish the retail price of its own brand, were reasonable, and the classification made by regulating retail, but not wholesale, prices was reasonable because the legislature could reasonably conclude that the larger number of retailers made price stabilization more necessary than for wholesalers. There was no unlawful delegation of legislative power because private contracts were not legislative in character. The provisions were therefore not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant, who had previously been convicted of this same offense, asserted that the testimony of a police officer established entrapment and on appeal sought the introduction of additional evidence to establish that defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for unlawfully selling, furnishing, and giving away marijuana, under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11500, an offense for which he had previously been convicted. The court affirmed the lower court's decision, denying defendant's application requesting that the testimony of a police officer be admitted on appeal in order to establish the defense of entrapment. In reaching this decision, the court refused to decide whether an appellate court in a criminal case could request the addition of evidence, but found that defendant had failed to establish that the requested evidence was unavailable at trial or would be anything other than cumulative. The court noted that under state law, evidence that a defendant had previously committed similar crimes or had a reputation of engaging in such crimes was not admissible on the issue of entrapment. It therefore found that the prosecution's inability to prove defendant's prior criminality was of little significance. The court also found that an officer's actions in allowing defendant the opportunity to commit a crime did not constitute entrapment.</SPAN></P>

The judgment holders contended that the insurance company's cancellation clause was ambiguous and contrary to the state's public policy. They also contended that the insurance company's failure to return or tender the unearned premium rendered the cancellation ineffective. The court disagreed with the judgment holders' contentions. The court concluded that the language of the cancellation clause was plain and unambiguous and it did not violate the state's public policy as expressed through the legislature.

No one who advocated the overthrow of the government should be certified under &sect; 6064.1. On his first application, the bar examiners had determined that the applicant had not shown he had good moral character as required by &sect; 6060(c) or that he did not advocate the overthrow of the government. In its reversal, the United States Supreme Court held that there was no evidence in the record justifying the bar examiners' findings and noted that he was not denied admission for refusing to answer questions. On remand, the bar examiners refused to certify the applicant for his refusal to answer questions it found to be material. The court found that because the refusal to certify was based upon the applicant's refusal to answer questions about his activities, and not upon those activities themselves, it was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the applicant's petition for review of the bar examiners' decision and denied his direct application for admission.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court had an inherent power to modify or vacate the injunction upon a showing that there had been a change in the controlling facts upon which the injunction rested, that the law had been changed, modified or extended, or where there the ends of justice would be served by modification.

On appeal, defendant contended that the transcript did not present a reasonably accurate and complete record of the evidence and other oral proceedings but was a fabrication of falsities constructed through the fraudulent and conspiratorial collaboration of the trial judge, the prosecuting attorney, and a substitute court reporter. The court concluded that the corrected report's transcript was substantially accurate and sufficiently complete in every respect to permit a fair review of the appeal from the judgments of conviction. The court rejected defendant's arguments that the court's acceptance of such transcript denied him constitutional rights. Further, the court held that defendant was not surprised or hindered in his defense by ensuing police testimony concerning his self-incriminating statements. The court held that the State had not imposed unconstitutionally cruel or unusual punishment on defendant.

The director contended that he had no duty to execute the printing orders on the ground that the printing contract did not become effective because he did not approve it and that no funds had been appropriated for the textbooks due to a restrictive budget provision. The board argued that the legislature could not validly interfere with the ultimate selection of textbooks made by the board by a restrictive provision in the budget. The court held that the restrictive budget provision violated the prohibitions of Cal. Const. art. IX, &sect; 7 because it was not merely a curtailment of curriculum but was a prohibition against the particular books named and the legislature could not take away the board's right of ultimate selection. Because the director originally took the position that he would honor the printing requisitions if the restrictive provision were held invalid, the court limited the writ to a consideration of the requisition without regard to or consideration of the budget restriction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A county ordinance prohibited the sale of so-called &quot;crime comic books.&quot; The superior court upheld the ordinance. The court reversed. The ordinance was an unjustifiable abridgement of the right to freedom of the press because no showing was made of a clear and present danger of a substantive evil justifying the suppression of the comics. The record failed to disclose a close, causal connection between the substantive evil claimed, juvenile delinquency, and the circulation of crime comic books in general. Further, the ordinance was too broad because it failed to draw any distinction between various accounts of crime. As written, Bugs Bunny, Woody Woodpecker, and Treasure Island accounts would have been forbidden by the ordinance. In addition, the ordinance denied the dealers equal protection because it established arbitrary and unreasonable exemptions. Finally, the ordinance failed to establish a clearly denied standard of guilt and, therefore, violated standards of due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer, supported by a majority of his employees, desired to enter into a union shop agreement with the union, but a local ordinance prohibited such agreements.

The court rejected the union's argument that the ordinance was invalid because the field of labor relations had been preempted by federal laws and concluded that the state's regulation of the field was not so complete as to preclude local regulations. However, the court found that the ordinance was invalid because it contained unseverable provisions which conflicted with the legislatively declared general labor policy of the state supporting the full freedom of employees for self-organization and for voluntarily selecting, and negotiating agreements through, their own employee committees or agencies. Therefore, the court concluded that the employer did not have a cause of action under the ordinance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff corporations challenged a judgment from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which had ruled that the county board of equalization erred in sustaining assessments against the corporations based on the present worth of the use of land for the unexpired term of a lease.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff corporations brought these actions to recover taxes on possessory interests in tax-exempt lands owned by the city. Judgments for defendants were entered after their demurrers were sustained, and plaintiffs appealed. The issue was whether the value of a possessory interest in tax-exempt land under the capitalization of income method of valuation was the present worth of the use of the land for the unexpired term of the lease or that worth less the present worth of rentals to become due. Plaintiffs contended that the county board of equalization erred in sustaining assessments based on the present worth of the use of the land for the unexpired term of the lease. The court affirmed. No distinction could have been made between rent and the cost of improvements that reverted to the lessor, for both were part of the purchase price of the leasehold, and no deduction could be made for that purchase price. The court held that a leasehold is not less valuable because it has not been paid for in advance, and to draw a distinction between rent paid and rent to be paid confuses the equity the lessee has in the leasehold with its value.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment from the trial court, which had denied the corporations relief in their attempt to recover taxes on possessory interests in tax-exempt lands owned by the city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus to secure his release from custody following his arrest for violation of San Francisco, Cal., Police Code &sect;&sect; 1119 and 1156.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was arrested after parking his taxicab in a stand designated for another's exclusive use, in violation of San Francisco, Cal., Police Code &sect;&sect; 1119 and 1156, which established exclusive stands and prohibited others from standing therein. Petitioner filed a writ of habeas corpus, challenging the ordinances' constitutionality. The court rejected respondent municipality's argument that the remedy was improper where petitioner was released on bail, as petitioner remained a constructive prisoner subject to restraint by penal authorities. However, the court discharged petitioner's writ by finding that the ordinances were a proper exercise of police power. The ordinances were rationally related to facilitating police supervision and preventing disorderly and aggressive passenger solicitation by competing companies. Furthermore, granting stands to one permittee was not invalidly discriminatory. Since respondent could deny use of its streets to all but one carrier, it could validly direct that each of several taxicab companies use separate stands.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner's writ was discharged, as ordinances providing for exclusive taxicab stands and prohibiting their use by others was a valid exercise of respondent municipality's police powers.</SPAN></P>
