<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from and sought habeas corpus relief from a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) that found her guilty of contempt of an order enjoining her from distributing maps on a public road pursuant to a municipal code regulation which plaintiff claimed was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was convicted of violating a municipal ordinance that banned the sale of printed materials upon defendant city's roadways after she sold maps to the public on a parkway. The conviction was later reversed on the ground the ordinance was unconstitutional. However, when prosecution was again sought, the ordinance was found constitutional, and the trial court entered an injunction against plaintiff prohibiting her from selling the maps on any street. After violating the order, plaintiff was found in contempt. She appealed the contempt order and also petitioned for habeas corpus relief. The court reversed the contempt judgment and issued a writ of habeas corpus. The map sales were not removed from U.S. Const. amend. I protection by the commercial speech doctrine because plaintiff's activity was only the sale of printed information itself, not its advertisement. Further, the ordinance was in excess of defendant city's police power because it did not merely regulate traffic but rather banned the sale of constitutionally protected material. However, the court proposed a way of curing the ordinance's unconstitutional effect, which was by deleting a particular cross-reference.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order enjoining plaintiff from selling maps on a public street and finding her in contempt and also granted her petition for writ of habeas corpus. The sale of maps did not fall within the commercial speech exception to freedom of speech protection. Further, the ordinance banning the sale of maps was an unconstitutional exercise of the defendant city's police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal petitioner was convicted of murder. The jury was dismissed and a mistrial declared as to the special circumstances phase of the trial, however, when the jury was unable to agree on the special circumstances allegations. Petitioner contended that he should not be retried for the special circumstances charges because the U. S. Supreme Court had held that death penalty statutes which did not provide for consideration of mitigating circumstances in the decision to impose capital punishment violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. On appeal, the court concluded Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 190 - 190.3 made death a mandatory punishment for first degree murders encompassed by the special circumstances without consideration of evidence of mitigating circumstances as to the offense or the personal characteristics of defendant. The statutes afforded no specific detailed guidelines as to the relevance of such evidence in determining whether death was an appropriate punishment, and they permitted arbitrary imposition of the death penalty in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U. S. Constitution. The peremptory writ of prohibition was issued.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) that was in favor of defendants in plaintiff's challenge to defendant school district's regulations pertaining to the sale and distribution of underground school newspapers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a high school sophomore, wrote for a newspaper distributed to students but produced independent of the school system. After an issue was published containing an article accusing defendant principal of lying, defendants prohibited distribution of the newspaper pursuant to the authority granted them under defendant school district's regulations which were promulgated in light of Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 10611. The trial court denied plaintiff's requests for relief, and she appealed. The court reversed and remanded. Any regulation prohibiting student expression violated the constitutional rights of students absent a showing that the students' activities materially and substantially disrupted the work and discipline of the school. Section 10611 did not authorize school districts to establish systems of prior restraint in respect to the distribution of prohibited categories of expression listed in the statute, nor did it authorize school districts to ban the sale of printed materials by students which were otherwise entitled to be distributed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment in favor of defendants in plaintiff's suit challenging defendant school district's regulations prohibiting distribution of an underground newspaper was reversed and remanded. The statutory authority relied on by defendants did not actually authorized them to establish a system of prior restraint and did not permit them to prohibit distribution of otherwise legitimate materials.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Santa Cruz County (California) that denied their petition for a writ of mandate challenging the criminal proceedings pending against them for violation of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 2141 on the ground that statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs engaged in the practice of midwifery without holding a certificate to practice midwifery. Criminal charges were filed against plaintiffs for violation of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 2141 which prohibited the unlicensed practice of the healing arts. Plaintiffs petitioned for a writ of mandate claiming &sect; 2141 was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the petition, and plaintiffs appealed. The court affirmed. In interpreting &sect; 2141, the court applied the general rule that a specific provision should be construed with reference to the entire statutory system of which it was a part, in such a way that the various elements of the overall scheme were harmonized. In light of the total statutory scheme governing the practice of &quot;healing arts,&quot; the court concluded that &sect; 2141's prohibition against unlicensed persons treating a &quot;physical condition&quot; was intended to encompass midwifery. As for the constitutionality of &sect; 2141, the court held that it was not unconstitutionally vague because an accused could reasonably be held to understand by its terms what conduct was prohibited. Further, &sect; 2141 did not, as plaintiffs claimed, prohibit constitutionally protected conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment denying plaintiffs' petition for a writ of mandate declaring the statute prohibiting the unlicensed practice of healing arts as unconstitutional was affirmed. The statute could reasonably be interpreted as prohibiting the unlicensed practice of midwifery. Further, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because plaintiffs were sufficiently put on notice by the statute's terms of what conduct was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant civil servant sought review of judgment denying a petition for administrative writ of mandate compelling civil service reinstatement in favor of respondent state personnel board in connection with an administrative dismissal. Appellant contended respondent's termination failed to comply with due process because punitive measures were imposed prior to the time he was afforded a hearing. The court determined such retroactive application of a decision was proper, holding due process was complied with if a civil servant was provided with preremoval safeguards of notice of the proposed action, reasons therefore, a copy of the charges, and materials upon which the action was based. The court reasoned that, at all time prior, employees who filed a written answer to notice of punitive action were afforded a substantive hearing, and therefore, retroactive application of the decision did not require respondent to hold hearings for all persons disciplined prior to the decision. The court concluded it was error to deny appellant damages from the time of actual dismissal until the date the decision was filed.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners sought a peremptory writ of mandate barring respondents from enforcing &sect;&sect; 85200-85202 against them. The court granted the petition. The United States Supreme Court recently held that limitations on expenditures by or on behalf of a candidate for federal office without proof of an overriding governmental interest infringed upon U.S. Const. amend. I's guarantees of free speech and association. The court held that the principles expressed in that decision were equally applicable to the initiative process. When U.S. Const. amend. I rights were affected, a strict scrutiny test was applied, and under this test, restraints would be upheld only if incidental to the promotion of a substantial or compelling governmental interest, unrelated to speech and unattainable by means less intrusive upon U.S. Const. amend. I rights. The court determined that no compelling interests were shown to justify &sect;&sect; 85200-85202's limitations; therefore, the sections were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

However, the Commission determined that &sect; 1202.3 was unconstitutional on the ground it unlawfully delegated discretion to private litigants to require closing of crossings merely by commencing a proceeding under &sect; 1202. The Commission further ordered petitioner to pay the costs of installing and maintaining protective devices. Petitioner sought review, and the court annulled the Commission's decision. The court held that the standard of public convenience and necessity were acceptable reasons for granting power, and this standard had been repeatedly applied in utility cases. The court looked to the language of &sect; 1202.3 and determined that the standard for compelling crossing improvement was a finding of necessity and convenience.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff applicant, a white male, appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Yolo County (California), denying an order admitting him to defendant university because, although defendant's special admission program discriminated against him because of his race in violation of the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, he would not have been selected even if there had been no special program for minorities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant university used a special admission program with a racial classification intended to assist minorities, which barred plaintiff applicant, a white male, because of his race. The court held that the program violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV because the purpose of the racial classification did not serve a compelling state interest and rigid scrutiny showed that there were other reasonable ways to achieve the state's goals by means imposing a lesser limitation on the rights of the group disadvantaged by the classification. Defendant did not meet its burdens to establish that a program that discriminated against white applicants because of their race was necessary to achieve an integrated student body and improved medical care for minorities, and to demonstrate that those goals could not be achieved by means less detrimental to the rights of the majority. Because plaintiff demonstrated that defendant had unconstitutionally discriminated against him, the burden should have shifted to defendant to prove that the special admission program did not result in his exclusion, which defendant conceded it could not do. Plaintiff, therefore, was entitled to an order that he be admitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's denial of an injunction ordering plaintiff applicant's admission to defendant university, but it affirmed the determination that the special admission program was invalid because its racial preference for persons less well qualified for the study of medicine violated the constitutional rights of nonminority applicants who were denied admission. The trial court was directed to order plaintiff's admission.</SPAN></P>

He sought a writ of habeas corpus, contending that the provision of former Cal.

The court discharged the order to show cause and denied the writ of habeas corpus, but directed the Adult Authority to grant parole consideration to petitioner without regard to the provisions of the former statute, because it constituted both cruel and unusual punishment under the California Constitution, based on its overbreadth in absolutely prohibiting parole for substantial periods of time without regard to the gravity of the particular offense, the nature of the offender, or the existence of possible mitigating circumstances. The court further concluded that the former law was unusual in its severity compared to other punishments levied in California for far more serious crimes and disproportionately long compared to similar offenses in states.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner prisoner appealed from the denial by the Court of Appeal (California) of a writ of mandate to order respondent trial court to vacate a default judgment against petitioner in a civil action, arguing that, because he was incarcerated, he had been denied the right to attend the trial and defend himself and the right to counsel in violation of due process and equal protection under U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A default judgment was entered against petitioner prisoner, who had been denied permission to attend the trial and denied right to counsel. The trial court refused to vacate the default judgment, and the court of appeal refused to issue a writ of mandate. The court decided that petitioner was unconstitutionally deprived of his right of access to both counsel and the courts, that the appointment of counsel, while not an absolute right, was only feasible method of granting access rights to indigent prisoners, and that proceeding by writ of mandate was proper. The state could not carry its burden of demonstrating a compelling state interest to justify the denial of both the right to counsel and the right to attend the trial and defend. The court concluded that such unqualified deprivation violated due process and equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7(a). Respondent trial court had a duty to determine whether petitioner had been denied meaningful access to the courts, and failure to do so was grounds for writ of mandate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff arrestee attacked a police officer who was beating plaintiff's wife.

A writ required a clear, present, ministerial duty, and a clear, present, beneficial right to its performance. The court found that defendants, municipal court judge and police officials, had no such duty. To comply with plaintiff's demand would violate Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 6200, for destroying public or court records. Absent the duty requirement, the court did not consider the right. The court held that incursions into individual privacy, if justified by a compelling interest, were not prohibited. The purposes for consulting records of arrests not resulting in conviction law enforcement, criminal justice, and protection from recidivist offenders were a compelling interest, which, given the available safeguards, outweighed plaintiff's legitimate concern of improper uses of his record.</SPAN></P>

After the jury began its deliberations, a juror requested to be excused from the panel. The trial court questioned her extensively and she stated that she was involved emotionally in the case and could not decide the case on the evidence and the law. The trial court dismissed the juror for good cause under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1089 and substituted an alternate juror. The jury continued its deliberations and found defendant guilty of three counts of first degree robbery. He appealed. The court affirmed and held that substitution of an alternate juror after final submission of the case to the jury was constitutional under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. However, it was error not to instruct the jury to begin its deliberations anew after the substitution. The court concluded that the error was harmless and not prejudicial because the case against defendant was very strong. There was no reasonable probability that a more favorable verdict would have been returned if the jury had been properly instructed following the substitution.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs sought to sue defendants in California, but were unable to obtain personal jurisdiction over them.

The property attached consisted of defendants' liability insurance company's obligation to indemnify and defend them. The insurance company was located in California. The superior court granted the attachment, and defendants specially appeared to file motions to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction, and to quash, vacate, or discharge the attachment, which were denied. Defendants' application for a writ to the court of appeals was denied. On appeal, the court concluded that the obligations of defendants' liability insurer to defend and indemnify them were contingent and uncertain, and not of such a nature as to be subject to attachment so as to confer on the court below quasi in rem jurisdiction.

Respondent, by way of a demurrer to the petition for mandate, asserted that the Act and respondent's resolutions suffered from numerous constitutional infirmities and refused to issue the requested bonds without an appropriate order from the court. The court concluded that the Act, construed to incorporate the provisions of Cal. Const. art.

The court found that the Act and petitioner's resolutions did not violate the constitutional prohibition against the gift of public funds and extension of public credit.

Plaintiff denied any liability under defendants' policy and filed a declaratory relief action to determine the extent of its liability. The trial court granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and defendants appealed. The court found that the pilot exclusion clause was unambiguous. Defendants could not have expected plaintiff to afford coverage without regard to the identity and qualifications of those persons entrusted with flying the aircraft.

A trial court found defendant had failed to take any steps to attempt to alleviate the segregated condition.

Defendant appealed from the judgment contending the segregated condition of its district's schools should properly be characterized as de facto rather than de jure and thus it owed no constitutional duty to alleviate such de facto school segregation. The reviewing court found the findings in the case adequately supported the trial court's conclusion that the segregation was de jure in nature. However the court stated that all public school districts bore an obligation under the state constitution to undertake reasonably feasible steps to alleviate school segregation, regardless of the cause of such segregation.

On appeal, defendant argued that it had no constitutional duty to alleviate segregation without such a finding.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile appealed from an order that committed him to the California youth authority following a conviction of misdemeanor assault. The question at issue was whether a misdemeanant between the ages of 16 and 21 could constitutionally be committed to the youth authority for a term potentially longer than the maximum jail term that might have been imposed for the same offense if committed by a person over the age of 21 years. The reviewing court concluded that the selective process that permitted the extended incarceration of youthful misdemeanants constituted a denial of equal protection of the law. Because of defendant's commitment to the youth authority, defendant remained incarcerated and faced a potential period of confinement several times longer than the longest jail term that might have been imposed. The court assessed defendant's equal protection claim by first finding that defendant's personal liberty was a fundamental interest. The court then applied a strict scrutiny standard and found Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1770 was unconstitutional. Therefore the court modified the decision so defendant was released from the youth authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">California voters approved a bond issue to provide funds for the future acquisition of park land and recreational and historical facilities. Plaintiff taxpayer filed a suit alleging that defendant, the Director of the state Department of Parks and Recreation (department), had illegally authorized the department to expend public funds to promote the passage of the bond issue. Plaintiff sought to have defendant repay the funds to the state treasury. The trial court sustained defendant's demurrer. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that in the absence of clear and explicit legislative authorization, a public agency could not expend public funds to promote a partisan position in an election campaign. Although the department had statutory authority to disseminate fair information to the public relating to the bond election, plaintiff specifically alleged that public funds were expended for &quot;promotional,&quot; rather than &quot;informational,&quot; purposes, and so stated a valid cause of action. The court concluded that defendant could be held personally liable to repay expended funds only if he failed to exercise due care in authorizing the expenditure of the funds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlords brought a class action against defendant city contending a charter amendment regarding rent control was void. The trial court declared the amendment void and enjoined defendant from enforcing the amendment because defendant was not faced with a serious public emergency which was a constitutional prerequisite to the imposition of rent controls under the police power. Defendant appealed from the decision. The court found that the charter amendment transgressed the constitutional limits of the police power, not because of its objectives, but because certain procedures it provided imposed heavy burdens upon landlords not reasonably related to the accomplishment of those objectives. The amendment required a blanket rollback of all controlled rents and prohibited any adjustments in maximum rents except under a unit-by-unit procedure. The rollback provision imposed hardship on the landlords. Furthermore, the charter amendment violated the requirements under the police power. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend and entered judgments of dismissal. Appellants challenged that judgment and the court reversed. The court held that the abatement in the present action must be directed to particular books or films which have been adjudged obscene following a fair and full adversary hearing, rather than against the premises in which the material is sold, exhibited or displayed.

The chase ended in Los Angeles County. Appealing from the Ventura County judgment, defendant contended that the separate prosecutions in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties violated Cal. Penal Code &sect; 654. The court held that joinder of the prosecutions was precluded by Cal. Penal Code &sect; 777. The court further held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 783 was inapplicable because the offenses were committed outside the getaway car at an identifiable spot along the highway; therefore, venue for each offense was in the county where it was committed. The court also held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering the sentences imposed run consecutively to sentences imposed in previous proceedings because defendant's assault on the police officer was a particularly aggravated offense. The court, however, stayed the execution of defendant's firearm possession offense because his possession of the officer's revolver was not antecedent and separate from his use of it in assaulting the officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In each of three separate trials, for each of three separate robberies, defendant received a sentence of five years to life. The first two sentences were to be concurrent, and the third was to be consecutive to them. To the resultant minimum aggregate term of 10 years were added years of imprisonment imposed pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022.5, because defendant used a firearm in the robberies. Under Cal.

Accordingly, defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction in the third trial, on the ground that he was denied equal protection of the law. The court affirmed the judgment, on the ground that &sect; 3024(d), was concerned with, and limited to, the minimum sentences imposed for the underlying felonies and had no application to the additional terms imposed under &sect; 12022.5.

Penal Code &sect; 315, however, no competent evidence of the circumstances surrounding the offense was introduced at the board hearing.

Although defendant did receive evidence of the circumstances surrounding the &sect; 316 conviction, the trial court concluded that a conviction based on a plea of nolo contendere could not be the basis for discipline.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART) sought damages from several petitioner contractors, who provided allegedly defective equipment and faulty services. Petitioners filed change of venue motions, under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 394, to transfer the case out of respondent Superior Court of Alameda County. Respondent denied the motions for change of venue, and ordered a separate trial on certain causes of action related to an accident on one of BART's trains. Petitioners appealed. On appeal, the court directed respondent to order a change of venue to a neutral county for all causes of action except those related to the accident and held that one defendant was not doing business in Alameda County as defined in &sect; 394 and was entitled to a change of venue. In order to avoid multiplicity of litigation, the court directed all causes not related to the accident removed to the same neutral county. As to the causes of action related to the accident, the court held that &sect; 394 would have been invoked only if a nonresident party sought a change of venue.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Town of Los Altos Hills formed a special assessment district to pay for capacity rights to a sewer system used by a portion of the town. That part of town had not produced enough tax revenue to pay for a contract which obligated defendant to pay a fixed sum for capacity rights. After a public hearing, defendant levied assessments on properties in the district. Plaintiff property owners sought, under Cal. Sts. &amp; High. Code &sect;10400, a judicial declaration that the assessment district and its acts were illegal, and an injunction to prevent any further assessments. The trial court denied plaintiffs any relief, and plaintiffs appealed. The court affirmed and held that the assessment district was legal, the sewer system accrued benefits to the assessed properties, and the assessments were not disproportional to the benefits to plaintiffs' properties. Defendant had authority, under the Municipal Improvement Act of 1913, Cal. Sts. &amp; High. Code &sect; 10000 et seq., to create sewer assessment districts.

The court held that where an out-of-state seller conducted a substantial mail order business with residents of a state imposing a use tax on such purchasers and the seller's connection with the taxing state was not exclusively by means of the instruments of interstate commerce, the slightest presence within such taxing state independent of any connection through interstate commerce permitted the state to impose on the seller the duty of collecting the use tax from such mail order purchasers and the liability for failure to do so..</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cal. Civ.

The court reversed the trial court's judgment, holding that the amendment to &sect; 5118 required retroactive application and the retroactive application, while it did deprive respondent of her property, did not violate her constitutional right to due process because it was necessary to abrogate rights in marital property that derived from the patently unfair former law. Although legislative enactments are presumed to operate prospectively, the court determined that retroactive application was consistent with the legislative intent, as evidenced by the probable unconstitutionality of the former statute and a letter of legislative intent published in a Senate resolution after enactment of the amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state official was enjoined from interfering with the candidacies of non-attorney judges seeking reelection, which petitioner appealed on the basis that the non-attorney judges were not qualified pursuant to Cal.

The court found that the term &quot;vacancy,&quot; as used in the statute, applied to vacancies arising in the course of a fixed term and those arising at the expiration of a fixed term even though the incumbent continues to hold office until the appointment of a successor. The court also held that its interpretation of &sect; 71701 did not discriminate against the non-attorney judges, as there were no members of the supposedly favored class, which the non-attorney judges proposed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner California Agricultural Labor Relations Board filed a writ of mandate to review the decision of respondents, the Superior Courts of Tulare and Fresno Counties (California), which issued various orders enjoining enforcement of Cal. Code Regs. tit. 8, pt. II, ch. 9, &sect;&sect; 20900-20901, which permitted qualified access to agricultural property by farm labor organizers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner agricultural labor board sought a writ of mandate to compel respondent trial courts to vacate orders enjoining regulations under Cal. Code Regs. tit. 8, pt. II, ch. 9, &sect;&sect; 20900-20901 that were adopted by petitioner, which granted a qualified right of access to growers' premises by labor organizers. Growers, the real parties in interest, filed actions attacking the validity of the regulations and seeking to prevent their enforcement. Respondents enjoined enforcement of the access regulations, and petitioner sought a writ of mandate requiring respondents to vacate their orders. On appeal, the court granted petitioner's action for writ of mandate. The access regulation was constitutional as it did not deprive real parties in interest of their property rights without due process of law, or constitute a taking without compensation. Incidental damages to property from governmental activities were not considered a taking of property. Further, the regulation was within the scope of authority conferred under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 11373, and was reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the regulation under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 11374.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted petitioner agricultural labor board's action for writ of mandate. The court held that an access regulation was constitutional because it did not violate due process, and did not constitute a taking of property rights without compensation. The regulation was otherwise valid because it was within the scope of authority conferred, and was reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers found contraband on defendant, who they volunteered to drive to his destination. The trial court, on remand, affirmed the decision of the appellate court vacating the trial court's motion to suppress order. The court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court held that it was not bound by the law of the case doctrine to follow the appellate court's ruling because its misapplication of the controlling law resulted in defendant's subsequent guilty plea and conviction, which otherwise would not have occurred. The pat-down search was impermissible because nothing in the evidence could have led the officers to believe that defendant was armed and dangerous. The court held that the officers should have informed defendant that he had a right to refuse the ride, and that if he accepted the ride, he would have been subject to a pat-down search for weapons. Because defendant was not presented with this option and did not consent to the search, the pat-down was an unreasonable invasion of defendant's privacy in violation of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 and U.S. Const. amend. IV. Thus, the contraband seized as a result of the search was inadmissible in evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court held there were ample grounds for finding that Cal. Civ. Proc.

Code &sect; 1110, appellate jurisdiction over the superior court judgment that denied plaintiff's request for a writ of prohibition. The court held that &sect; 311 was, as already judicially construed, sufficiently specific in its definition of what constituted obscene material. The court ruled that plaintiff could not allege error by the fact that the statute required respondent to carry a greater burden of proof than was imposed under the United States Constitution. The court relied upon a controlling precedent which determined that &sect; 311 satisfied the requirement of specificity under the Miller test by prohibiting patently offensive depictions of hardcore sexual conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of possession of marijuana for sale. He appealed his conviction on the basis of an allegedly illegal search and seizure. During the pendency of his appeal, he moved for an order of release on appeal. In arguing for release, counsel noted that petitioner had made all court appearances and that the conviction would likely be reversed on appeal. The trial court denied the motion and the lower appellate court denied his subsequent application for bail pending appeal. Petitioner then sought a writ of habeas corpus to obtain a release on appeal. The court denied his petition, holding that Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, which ensured to defendants in non-capital cases the availability of release on bail as a matter of right, only applied to preconviction bail. Further, the court held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1272 did not violate the equal protection clauses of the federal or state constitutions. Finally, the court held that because the trial court did not give a statement as to its reasons for denying bail, it could not determine whether that court abused its discretion. Accordingly, petitioner was permitted to file a new application with the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged was rape, forced oral copulation, burglary, and assault. Six months later, the prosecution was granted a three month continuance. Petitioner sought extraordinary writ relief, and a peremptory writ was issued directing the trial court to set aside its order and to enter a new order denying the motion. The prosecutor was then unable to proceed as a witness was unavailable. The trial court dismissed the case. A new complaint alleging nearly identical offenses was filed the same day. A preliminary examination was held, and petitioner filed a motion to suppress evidence. The prosecutor argued that res judicata and collateral estoppel barred relitigation of the motion, which had been previously denied. The information was set aside because the trial court determined that the failure to hear the motion denied petitioner a substantial right. A third action was filed, and petitioner sought extraordinary writ relief, contending that the filing was barred because the charges had been twice dismissed pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1387. The court denied the petition because the statute was not vague and ambiguous and one prior dismissal was due to excusable neglect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which, pursuant to Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 23182, ordered appellant to refund moneys paid by respondent savings and loan for the appellant's business license tax. Appellant contended that &sect; 22182 was an unconstitutional attempt by the legislature to regulate a municipal affair of a charter city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent savings and loan challenged appellant city's business license tax for violating Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 23182, which imposed a tax on net earnings of financial institutions in lieu of all other state, county, and municipal taxes and licenses. The superior court entered judgment in favor of respondent ordering appellant to refund the taxes paid because in an area of statewide concern, the state legislature could curb the taxing power of a charter city. Appellant sought review contending that its power to tax for revenue purposes could be limited only by an amendment to the constitution or to its charter. The court noted that the home rule doctrine under Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5(a) granted chartered cities the authority to manage local affairs while restricting the state's power to interfere with municipal matters. Because the power to impose taxes to raise revenue was a municipal affair pursuant to a direct constitutional grant, the court reversed the judgment holding that a statewide concern analysis was irrelevant to the business license tax imposed by appellant.</SPAN></P>

After the appellate court affirmed the denial of appellant's motion, the matter was reversed by the United States Supreme Court and remanded to the appellate court for further proceedings. On remand, the court affirmed again, holding that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's motion because the McCarty holding never indicated that state courts were divested of subject matter jurisdiction to divide military retirement benefits, that appellant agreed to the division, and that the McCarty holding was not retroactive.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court considered three issues involving interpretation of the agreement. First, was the arbitration provision unconscionable and therefore unenforceable; second, were the arbitrators empowered to award punitive damages; and third, were awards of attorney fees and costs authorized? The court held that unconscionability of an arbitration provision or another contractual clause must be measured at the time the agreement was made and there was no inherent unconscionability in the parties' arbitration agreement. The court further held that the arbitrators' award of punitive damages was not, as a matter of law, in excess of the arbitrators' powers.

After defendant denied plaintiff's request, plaintiff filed an action pursuant to Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code 30434, in the trial court for a refund of taxes paid, under protest. The trial court denied defendant's request. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the Act did not violate proposition 13, the single subject rule, applicable to initiatives.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff safety activist prepared and distributed a pamphlet on public hearings and issues regarding the use of polybutylene pipe for drinking water. Defendant oil company was the manufacturer of the resin found in the pipes. Defendant sought to enjoin trade libel and obtain declaratory relief against plaintiff and the laboratory involved in the testing. After defendant settled with the laboratory, its motion to dismiss plaintiff was granted. Plaintiff filed a lawsuit for malicious prosecution against defendant and was awarded damages in the trial court. The court affirmed the judgment and stated that injunctive relief against further dissemination of plaintiff's report constituted a prior restraint of publication and its issuance was barred by U.S. Const. amend. 1, and that statements made in the context of public debate on a matter of public health could not be enjoined. The action for declaratory relief lacked probable cause because defendant sought a scientific declaration concerning its product rather than a declaration of a legal right. The court found that no reasonable attorney would have believed that there was a legal basis for defendant's actions against plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that charges made by respondent for costs relating to some facilities were inappropriate, but that the charge of depreciation to the operation and maintenance account on those facilities was appropriate. The trial court held that appellant did not carry its burden of proving that respondent violated the article. The court affirmed without comment the trial court's ruling that depreciation was properly included. The court held that policy and fairness dictated that respondent carry the burden of proving compliance with the article in order to insure accurate record keeping on the part of respondent.

The court affirmed the judgment for respondents holding that appellant did not present competent evidence showing the restrictions were unreasonable or enforced in an unfair and discriminatory manner. The court held that the restrictions were reasonable and enforceable under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1354. The court determined that because the restrictions on use and alienation were justified by legitimate purposes of public policy to provide affordable housing, and were authorized by Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient challenged a judgment from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) that, in plaintiff's medical malpractice suit against defendant doctor, reduced plaintiff's award of noneconomic damages to conform to the cap provided for in Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3333.2. Plaintiff contended that the trial court erred in applying &sect; 3333.2 after plaintiff's comparative fault was factored into the damage equation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In her medical malpractice action against defendant doctor, plaintiff patient appealed a judgment that reduced plaintiff's award of noneconomic damages to conform to the cap on such damages as provided for in Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3333.2. The cap was applied after the award, which exceeded the $ 250,000 cap, and was reduced by plaintiff's comparative fault. The court reversed the judgment. The court noted that it was constrained to adhere to the jury's determination that plaintiff's noneconomic damages were in an amount that exceeded the statutory cap. The court further observed, in apparent agreement with plaintiff, that a medical malpractice patient could, as did plaintiff, suffer more than $ 250,000 in noneconomic damages but was precluded from recovering any more than that amount. Thus, the court ruled, it was error to apply the cap after plaintiff's damages had been reduced by her comparative fault; the cap should have been applied before comparative fault was factored into the damages equation. The court reasoned that to permit such a reduction in plaintiff's recovery amounted to a punishment for her comparative fault that was not the policy behind comparative fault analysis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed a judgment that reduced plaintiff patient's noneconomic damages award to conform to the statutory cap for such damages in plaintiff's malpractice action against defendant doctor. The cap was no more than a limitation on plaintiff's recovery, and it should have been applied to plaintiff's award, which exceeded the cap, before the award was reduced by comparative fault. Plaintiff was entitled to the maximum award under the cap.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a publishing company and its subsidiary, by a writ of supersedeas, appealed an order from the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), issuing a preliminary junction that restrained defendants from conditioning the employment of plaintiff job applicants, and of any other member of the named class seeking employment with defendant subsidiary, upon submission of mandatory urinalysis testing for drugs and alcohol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff job applicants obtained a preliminary injunction restraining defendants, a publishing company and its subsidiary, from conditioning employment of certain categories of job applicants upon submission to mandatory urinalysis testing for drugs and alcohol. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 1 recognized a right to privacy and was intended to protect that right from both governmental and private intrusion. However, in the context of private action, the test was whether the conduct complained of so substantially burdened plaintiff's right of privacy that it was constitutionally unreasonable. Because employers were authorized to condition employment on results of a medical examination under Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, &sect; 7294.0(d) and Cal. Gov't. Code &sect;&sect; 12920, 12921, 12926, and 12994, and a urinalysis was a routine part of any medical examination, job applicants should reasonably anticipate such testing. The testing was only slightly more intrusive than other aspects of the job-seeking process; the subject applicants were given advanced notice of the testing; and the procedures used minimized the intrusiveness of the drug-screening program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order granting the preliminary injunction was reversed. While defendant subsidiary's preemployment drug and alcohol testing program did intrude upon a recognized expectation of privacy, it did not so substantially burden the right to privacy that it was constitutionally impermissible; nor was the program otherwise unlawful. Plaintiff job applicants had no likelihood of prevailing on the merits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed a decision of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California) in so far as it limited the relief granted to the imposition of civil penalties and an injunction against future unfair business practice in an action against defendants, property owner and associated corporations, for violating San Francisco City Subdivision Code &sect; 1385. Defendants cross-appealed the adverse judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state brought an action for unfair business practice against defendants, property owner and associated corporations, seeking injunction, restitution and civil penalties for failure to comply with San Francisco Subdivision Code &sect; 1385. Defendants were involved in the sale and resale of condominiums to persons who did not meet the income requirements and without having first been offered to the city in violation of San Francisco Subdivision Code &sect; 1385. The trial court ruled against defendants, enjoined them from future violation of the code, and awarded the maximum statutory civil penalty. The trial court, however, denied the state's other forms of injunctive relief and the state appealed. Defendants cross-appealed on the trial court's adverse judgment. The court reversed the trial court's decision insofar as it denied the state further injunctive relief because the trial court erred in determining that it lacked the power to enforce any remedy other than a preventative injunction and statutory penalties. The court affirmed the judgment in all other respects and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed in part and affirmed in part.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a Mexican national juvenile, challenged the order of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which authorized a California juvenile court to transfer him to Mexican juvenile officials in Mexico, under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 738.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Mexican national juvenile was caught stealing in San Diego and made a ward of the juvenile court. Pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 738, appellant was returned to Mexican juvenile authorities. Appellant challenged the validity of Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 738, contending that it was unconstitutional because it violated the U.S. Const. art. VI, Supremacy Clause and the Compact Clause, U.S. Const. art. I &sect; 10. On appeal, the court affirmed the order returning appellant to juvenile authorities in Mexico, holding that &sect; 738 did not require nor invite any form of agreement with any foreign power. The court reasoned that &sect; 738 did nothing more than permit California to order the removal from its borders of alien minors who had conducted themselves so as to come within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. The court concluded that there could be no doubt but that California has such power and that federal preemption did not apply. The court noted that appellant neither availed himself of a formal deportation process nor did he request the court to stay the enforcement of its order to return him to Mexico pending review of his appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the juvenile court, holding that the federal preemption did not apply to bar California from ordering nonresident juveniles returned to their country of origin, especially when the juvenile is first presented to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for processing through the federal deportation system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand from the United States Supreme Court, petitioner sought reconsideration of his writ of habeas corpus application seeking relief from a judgment of contempt for failure to pay child support. Petitioner alleged that Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1209.3, which required the trial court to presume prima facie evidence of contempt after proof of non-compliance with a court order, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was found in contempt for failure to pay child support and sentenced to a period of probation. Petitioner filed an application for habeas corpus relief, alleging that Cal. Civ. Proc.

The court initially granted the application, and the prosecution filed an application for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, which was granted. The United States Supreme Court remanded the case back to the court. On remand, the court denied the application for habeas corpus. The court held that the prosecution was not required to show ability to pay as an element of the contempt, instead, inability to pay was a defense that petitioner had the burden of pleading and proving. The court held that the act of raising the defense did not put too harsh a burden on petitioner, and once the defense was raised, the burden would shift to the prosecution to rebut petitioner's claims and prove his ability to pay.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After remand, the court denied petitioner's habeas corpus application because the presumptions raised by the civil procedure code were not unconstitutional, petitioner could raise his inability to pay as a defense to the contempt presumption, petitioner had the burden of pleading and proving his inability to pay, and, if petitioner successfully raised the defense, the burden would shift to the state to disprove petitioner's claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal by defendant state attorney general, the court found that the trial court had not abused its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction, sought by plaintiff health care providers, preventing the implementation of Assemb.

It found that the trial court's determination that greater harm would result from implementing the law than from not implementing it was supported by substantial evidence and thus would not be overturned. Noting that the choice to have an abortion was protected under the privacy right of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, and could not be intruded upon absent a compelling state interest, the court held that the privacy right did not distinguish between children and adults. It concluded that there was sufficient evidence for the trial court to find that plaintiffs could prevail at trial because plaintiffs had demonstrated that they could prove that the state interests cited by defendant, protecting minors from harm and preserving the parent/child relationship, were protected as well or better under existing law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state alleged that appellant juvenile came under the provisions of Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.

The court held that appellant's departure from his parents' home did not constitute an escape within the meaning of &sect; 871.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case addressed the constitutionality of policies and practices followed by state officials in disseminating arrest record information to public employers and licensing entities. Plaintiffs brought actions challenging a range of policies implemented by the defendants, various state officials. The trial court entered a judgment granting in part and denying in part plaintiffs' requests for declaratory and injunctive relief. On review, the court affirmed in most respects and concluded that dissemination of arrest records to authorized agencies for employment, licensing and certification purposes significantly affected plaintiffs' right to privacy guaranteed by the California Constitution. It also rejected defendants' contention that state officials were merely a conduit for information and had no duty whatsoever to verify, update, or censor information received before disseminating it. According to the court, because dissemination of arrest record information impinges on the fundamental privacy rights of Californians, defendants could disseminate such information only when it served a compelling state interest, such as for evaluating persons seeking employment as peace officers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's decision granting in many respects plaintiffs' requests for declaratory and injunctive relief pertaining to defendant state officials' dissemination of arrest records was substantially affirmed, with certain modifications.

It held that respondents, as residents and taxpayers, had standing to bring the action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant developer sought review of a judgment entered by the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California) that granted respondent architect's motion for an order enforcing settlement under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 664.6. On appeal, appellant contended that the offer and acceptance made before the referee was not made before the court as required by that section.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent architect filed suit to foreclose on a mechanic's lien for work it completed on a condominium complex under construction by appellant developer. At a mandatory settlement conference held before a referee, appellant offered to settle the matter for a cash amount and waiver of the lien. Respondent subsequently accepted that offer. After appellant failed to execute payment, respondent obtained a judgment that ordered enforcement of the settlement under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 664.6. On appeal, the court noted that Cal.  Civ. Proc.  &sect; 664.6 required that the settlement offer had to be made &quot;before the court&quot; in order for enforcement under that section and that Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 639 limited the powers of a referee. No provision of that section in turn authorized a referee to conduct settlement proceedings. The court thus concluded that the offer made before the referee did not transpire &quot;before the court&quot; within the meaning of Cal.  Civ. Proc.  &sect; 664.6. As the statutory predicates for the enforcement of the agreement were not reached, the judgment entered in favor of respondent was reversed, and costs of appeal were awarded to appellant.</SPAN></P>

The settlement conference before the referee wherein agreement was reached between parties was not a judicially supervised proceeding as required under the applicable statute, and therefore, the trial court erred when it enforced the parties' alleged settlement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city brought suit against appellant theater owners to enjoin violations of local ordinances and a public nuisance. Following trial, the court found that appellants had violated a local ordinance prohibiting topless dancing in premises licensed to sell alcoholic beverages and issued a permanent injunction. Appellants argued on appeal that the state had not delegated authority to respondent under U.S. Const. amend. XXI to regulate such conduct, that topless dancing was protected conduct under the state constitution, and as an establishment primarily devoted to theatrical entertainment, the theater in question was exempt from the local ordinance banning topless dancing. The court reversed the lower court's judgment and remanded the case for further determination. The state had not delegated to respondent its expanded powers under the U.S. Const. amend. XXI; thus, the respondent's authority to regulate conduct in establishments licensed by the state to sell alcoholic beverages derived solely from its general police power. Accordingly, the local ordinances could not be presumed valid under U.S. Const. amend. XXI.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a trial court decision that convicted defendant, after a jury trial, of violating Cal. Penal Code &sect; 69. Defendant contended that the trial court committed err in not giving a &quot;unanimity&quot; instruction to the jury as to the &sect; 69 charge in light of the prosecution's failure to elect a specific &sect; 69 offense upon which to rely in proving the charge, erred in not giving a clarification instruction as to the constitutionally allowable application of &sect; 69, and erred in failing to properly instruct the jury regarding requisite intent necessary to convict under &sect; 69. The court reversed. The trial court was required to giving an &quot;unanimity&quot; instruction in conformity with Cal. Jury Instructions - Criminal No. 17.01 because defendant was accused of but one offense and the evidence was susceptible of proving the commission of more than one offense. The prosecution failed to make an election regarding the specific offense. The trial court erred by not instructing the jury that the phrase &quot;any threat&quot; in &sect; 69 applied only to threats of unlawful violence. The trial court also erred by failing to properly instruct the jury on the degree of intent necessary for a &sect; 69 conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, city council member, sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California), which denied his petition for a writ of mandate to compel respondent, town, to give him a copy of a tape recording of a closed session hearing he did not participate in due to a conflict of interest. Appellant based his claim on Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 54956.9 and respondent opposed it based on Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 87100.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, town, held a town meeting, including a closed session to discuss with its attorney a matter in litigation. Appellant, town council member, voluntarily left the council during the closed session because of a conflict of interest. Appellant subsequently asked the town clerk to permit him to listen to the tape of the closed session. She refused and appellant filed a petition for a writ of mandate to require the town to make the tape available to him. The superior court found that because appellant was disqualified from acting or participating in the discussion between the council and its attorney, he had no greater right to the tape than the public at large. The superior court also held that disclosure to appellant would constitute waiver of the attorney-client privilege. The court agreed and affirmed the superior court's judgment denying the writ. The court held that Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 87100 prevented appellant from participating in the closed session and the superior court properly denied access to the tape of that hearing in order to forestall the appearance of possible improprieties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that appellant, town council member, was prohibited from obtaining a tape recording of a closed session between the council and its attorney, where the council met to discuss litigation related to a matter in which appellant had a conflict of interest. Therefore, the court concluded that the superior court properly denied appellant access to the tape recording of the closed session, and affirmed the denial of the writ of mandate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Santa Clara County removed appellant mother's three children from her custody because allegations of child abuse were substantiated. The trial court found that appellant was not fit for reunification with her children pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 232 and Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 361.5(b)(2). The court stated that vagueness occurs when a legislature states its proscriptions in terms so indefinite that the line between innocent and condemned conduct became a matter of guesswork. The court found that appellant failed to examine whether there was a constitutionally protected interest at stake to which her claim of vagueness would apply and that there was no question of appellant's having sufficient notice of the proscribed conduct in &sect; 361.5(b)(2) so as to avoid it. The court also found that there was no improper purpose underlying the statutes because they had a rational relationship to the purpose of ensuring the well being of children whose parents were incapable of caring for them. The court affirmed the orders because it found sufficient evidence of the findings in the testimony of two psychologists' opinion of appellant's mental state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged a decision by the trial court that ordered blood tests to determine the paternity of a minor child and established a 99.1 percent probability that appellant was the father of the minor child. The child was born eight days before her mother separated from her husband. The trial court applied Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 621, disregarded the results of the blood tests, and determined that husband was the child's father. Appellant challenged the parternity order. On appeal the court reversed the order because the trial court's application of the presumption of &sect; 621 was unconstitutional.&nbsp;Section 621 provided that when a wife was cohabiting with her husband, who was not impotent or sterile, the wife's child was presumed to be a child of the marriage. The minor child had no available mother, the man the court determined was her legal father was a stranger to her, and her most important psychological relationship was with a sibling to whom she was presumed biologically unrelated. As a result, the court concluded the statute's classification did not serve the interests it was designed to protect. Accordingly, the court held that application of &sect; 621 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court's application of a statutory presumption of paternity was unconstitutional where the statute's classification did not serve the interests it was designed to protect because application would lead to a custody situation that was contrary to the child's best interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, religious organization, sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Orange County (California) that awarded respondents, mother and daughter, compensatory and punitive damages in their action for false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, libel, and wrongful death after respondent daughter ran away to live in appellant's commune.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, religious organization, challenged the judgment in favor of respondents, mother and daughter, in respondents' action seeking damages that occurred when respondent daughter ran away to join appellant, and appellant's leaders assisted her in her efforts to remain hidden from her parents. The court reversed the judgment with respect to respondent daughter, but affirmed the award in favor of respondent mother. The court found that respondent daughter was not falsely imprisoned because she was of sufficient age to consent and no force or physical threat of force was used against her, nor was she inflicted with emotional distress because no force or fraud was used against her. The court found that appellant's official position letter was false and defamatory with respect to respondent mother because it implied that she beat her daughter. The court also found that appellant intentionally inflicted emotional distress on respondent mother because its leaders assisted respondent daughter in her efforts to run away, lied about their involvement, and refused to disclose respondent daughter's whereabouts. The court found that the punitive damage award was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the extended statute of limitations under Cal. Ins. Code &sect; 11580.2(g) did not apply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant uninsured motorist hit another car, injuring three persons and damaging their car. The injured persons were covered by plaintiff insurer. One party settled her claim with plaintiff under Cal. Ins. Code &sect; 11580.2(i) within one year of the accident. The other two parties preserved their right to pursue their uninsured motorist claims under &sect;11580.2(i) by filing suit against plaintiff within one year of the accident, and later settled their claims with plaintiff. Plaintiff sued defendant for subrogation for the amounts plaintiff paid to the injured parties. Defendant contended that the three-year statute of limitations under Cal. Ins. Code &sect; 11580.2(g) did not allow plaintiff to prosecute claims of its insureds to which it became subrogated where the one year statute of limitations applicable to the insureds' personal claims against defendant had expired. The trial court found in favor of plaintiff. The appellate court affirmed and held that the extended limitations period of &sect; 11580.2(g) was intended to protect plaintiff's subrogation rights. The court held that &sect; 11580.2(g) served a legitimate state purpose and was constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the subrogation statute allowed plaintiff to seek subrogation from defendant for benefits paid to plaintiff's insureds, whom defendant injured in an accident, within three years of paying those benefits, despite expiration of the one year statute of limitations for insureds' claims against defendant.</SPAN></P>

Appellants had been only partially successful in their complaint to have women admitted to the county mounted patrol unit in that the unit was ordered to either cease operating as an arm of the county sheriff's department, and thus in violation of the equal protection clause of the constitution, or admit women members. Respondents chose to cut ties with the sheriff's department. The trial court held that appellants were not the prevailing party and denied the motion for fees. The court reversed and held that petitioners did prevail as the alternative relief they requested was granted.

Appellant claimed that respondent's involuntary placement, even though she was nonviolent and objected to the commitment, was provided for in recent case law with an alternative and nonstatutory vehicle for judicially committing developmentally disabled adults to a state hospital. The court found that the only proper party to bring a petition for involuntary commitment was one legally authorized to seek commitment as provided in Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.

The court held that persons of common intelligence would necessarily conclude Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 1635(b)(7) required decking to be secured before an employee worked upon it. A less restrictive meaning or application would have seriously endangered employees and conflicted with the mandate of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 6300 et seq. Substantial evidence negated the existence of a &quot;well-devised employer safety program.&quot; Plaintiff's practice was insufficiently distinct from the improper procedure engaged in by the injured employees.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his second degree murder conviction, arguing he was prejudiced by an improper jury instruction regarding second degree felony murder. The court held that the jury instruction on felony murder was erroneously overbroad because it allowed the jury to use an inapplicable underlying felony. A second degree felony murder jury instruction could not be given when based on a felony that was an integral part of the homicide and that was included in fact with the homicide. The court found that although defendant committed three assaults with a deadly weapon, and that one of the felonious assaults could not have been used as the felony underlying felony murder, the jury instructions failed to differentiate between the assaults. As the court could not determine whether the jury relied on an improper or proper felony to convict defendant of felony murder, and as it was clear that the jury could have relied on a felony murder theory in convicting defendant, the imprecise jury instruction prejudiced defendant. Defendant's conviction was thus reversed because there was reasonable doubt as to whether defendant would have been convicted under proper instructions.</SPAN></P>

Appellants asserted that the ordinance was invalid because the city attorney did not explain its impact on existing law.

The appeals court held that &sect; 5025 did not apply because it governed pre-election activities. Further, the court held that appellants' attempt to use a prohibitory mandamus was improper. The court addressed the appellants' challenge to the fairness of the election process. The court affirmed. The court concluded that the election contest remedy was not available to appellants because they failed to prove they were electors of East Palo Alto under Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 20021.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs owned land designated as coastal zone on certain state maps and subject to certain regulations.

The land's location in the coastal zone on the state maps was controlling over descriptive language in the statute defining the coastal zone, Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 30103(a). The court held that plaintiffs failed to show that the available procedure of asserting the invalidity of permit conditions through a petition for writ of administrative mandate was not a fair forum. The court held that one plaintiff had waived objection to development conditions by complying with them, and failing to exhaust its administrative remedies by filing an action for administrative mandamus before or with its claim for inverse condemnation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his arrest for masturbating in front of two young boys, petitioner pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of annoying or molesting children under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 647.6. Defendant was granted probation on the condition that he register as a sex offender. Petitioner filed for a writ of habeas corpus challenging the registration requirement. The court denied the writ, finding that the registration requirement was not cruel and unusual punishment.  Cal. Penal Code &sect; 647.6 was enacted to protect children from sexual offenders, and violation of &sect; 647.6 indicated an abnormal sexual interest with respect to children. Lack of physical contact was not dispositive. The fact that petitioner sought out young children in the neighborhood two days in a row, touched their belongings to get their attention while he masturbated, and admitted to having an addiction to exhibitionism, supported the finding that he was likely to repeat the incident. There was not sufficient evidence of disparity in punishments in the same jurisdiction, or other jurisdictions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee's complaint alleged that defendant union negligently breached its contract by inadequately representing him before, during and after disciplinary proceedings against him. The trial court ruled that the union owed plaintiff no duty and dismissed his complaint after its demurrer was sustained without leave to amend. The issue on appeal was whether a labor union, voluntarily representing one of its members in a disciplinary hearing before a municipal civil service board, had a duty of care and, if so, the nature of such duty. After review, the court concluded that the union owed plaintiff a duty akin to that of fair representation and such a duty would be breached if the union acted arbitrarily, discriminatorily or in bad faith. The court found that the trial court erred in finding no duty and that the complaint either already stated or could have been amended to state a claim for the breach of its duty to provide the equivalent of fair representation. Because the trial court improperly sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, its judgment was reversed and the case remanded with directions to enter an order granting plaintiff time to amend his complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), which held unconstitutional appellant's ordinance restricting the sale of appellee's sex-related tabloid from city newsracks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city argued trial court error in ruling its ordinance unconstitutional because the ordinance, which restricted the newsrack locations for selling appellee's sex-related tabloid, was legitimately aimed at bolstering the effectiveness of existing legislation on adult entertainment activity and at restricting access of minors to adult newspapers. The court disagreed, noting first that the latter targeted tabloid &quot;speech&quot; and was, thus, content-based and impermissible. Moreover, the ordinance, also aimed at preventing urban blight, was not content-neutral. No independent studies demonstrated that newsracks, as opposed to bookstores and theaters, had a secondary and negative impact on neighborhoods; nor was this content-based ordinance justified by a compelling state interest, as it was not narrowly drawn and limited to obscenity or matters deemed harmful to minors by statute, but applicable even to benign publications. Because the relationship between ordinance and legitimate state interest was tenuous, the ordinance was constitutionally impermissible. Appellate attorney fees were justified when fees for a successful prosecution had already been awarded appellee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed holding unconstitutional appellant city's ordinance restricting to certain locations sales of appellee's sex-related tabloid from city newsracks, as ordinance was neither a content-neutral attempt to prevent urban blight nor a content-based effort that was justified by compelling state interest or narrowly drawn and limited to matters deemed harmful to minors by statute.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment on the basis that, generally, requirements relating to the time within which an act had to be done were directory rather than mandatory or jurisdictional, unless a contrary intent was clearly expressed. The court stated that the consistent legislative intent of Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 16075 was to address the problem of uninsured motorists by speedily removing them from the road, not to make a mandatory time period for a hearing, and that the statute imposed no penalty on respondent for failure to meet the statute's time requirements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent candidate received a winning percentage of the votes cast for the position of district supervisor. Appellant contestant, a registered voter, challenged the election on the ground that respondent was not a registered voter in the district at least 30 days before the deadline, as required by Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 25041. The trial court refused to invalidate the election based on the failure to comply with the requirements of &sect; 25041. The court reversed the judgment. In so ruling, the court held that strict compliance with &sect; 25041 was required, and the fact that respondent missed the deadline for registering by two days rendered him ineligible to run for office. In reaching the conclusion that strict compliance with &sect; 25041 was required, the court relied on the use of the term &quot;shall&quot; in reference to the registration requirement indicating that the provision was mandatory. Moreover, applying strict scrutiny test, the court found the registration requirement in &sect; 25041 to be constitutional because it was narrowly designed to promote the state's interest in regulating the election process to insure only qualified residents were put before the electorate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant inmate was arrested on an outstanding warrant, and a search incident to his arrest produced tar heroin in his pocket. Appellant contended that the sentence imposed upon his conviction was an illegal sentence, violative of the double-the-base-term provision of Cal. Penal Code &sect;1170.1(g) and violative of the U.S. and California Constitutions. The court found that Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11370.2(a) was enacted to add additional penalties where the person found to be in possession of drugs had also possessed drugs for sale in the past and where that person had suffered a prior conviction for possession for sale. The court found that a reading that &sect; 1170(g) precluded imposition of the three-year sentence enhancement under &sect; 11370.2(a) would negate its stated purpose. This would also have been inconsistent with the legislative intent. Accordingly, the judgment and sentence was affirmed because the plain language of &sect; 11370.2(a) meant that a person in defendant's situation should have an additional three-year enhancement added to any term of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment of conviction for possession for sale and sentence was affirmed because the sentence imposed did not violate a double-the-base-term provision or the U.S. and California Constitutions when the legislative intent was to punish the person who possessed drugs for sale and had suffered a prior conviction for possession for sale.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a 17 year old minor, was convicted of attempted first degree murder. Defendant appealed, alleging that his sentence of life with the possibility of parole was indeterminate and that therefore he was eligible for commitment to the California Youth Authority (CYA). The court disagreed, noting that the sentence was clearly within the reach of Cal.  Welf. &amp; Inst.  &sect; 1731.5, which excluded from CYA commitment of juveniles sentenced to imprisonment for life; nowhere did the statute distinguish between those who were or were not eligible for parole. Defendant also argued his sentence violated the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const. amend VIII and Cal. Const. art I, &sect; 17 because defendants convicted of first degree murder, rather than attempted murder, had a sentencing advantage in being eligible for commitment to CYA. The court noted disparities in sentencing, but held defendant's sentence was constitutional. First, eligibility for CYA commitment did not guarantee that a defendant would be committed there. Also, defendants ineligible for CYA commitment could still be housed there and participate in its programs until they reached 25 years of age.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner's application for a writ of prohibition restraining further proceedings was denied. However, the state supreme court issued a transfer order directing the court to issue an alternative writ requiring respondent WCAB to cease and desist or to show cause why a preemptory writ should not issue. After a hearing, the court discharged the writ and denied relief to petitioner. The court held that the judicial power vested in respondent WCAB pursuant to Cal. Lab.

The affidavits and documents in support of the order to show cause established a prima facie showing of contempt sufficient to justify its issuance under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1209.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner grand jury was engaged in a murder investigation. The prime suspect in the murder was represented by an attorney, who retained the assistance of private investigator The grand jury learned that the private investigator knew of the identity of an eyewitness to an argument between the suspect and the victim before her murder, and it subpoenaed the investigator to disclose the information. The trial court ruled that all information in the private investigator's possession relating to the case was subject to the attorney-client privilege. The grand jury petitioned for writ of mandate. The court sustained the decision of the trial court denying the interrogation, but not solely on the attorney-client privilege, but because of the pre-indictment nature of the case. It held that the right to counsel under the U.S. Const. amend. VI, unimpeded by interference of the prosecution, together with the privilege against self-incrimination, under U.S. Const. amend. V, precluded the questioning sought by the grand jury. It held that the investigator's work product was privileged. The court denied the writ of mandate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A private corporation entered into a contract with a defendant agency to purchase a new hospital facility. The corporation then entered into a contract with plaintiff contractor to construct the building. Plaintiff was initially told that the project was a private project. However, six months after plaintiff commenced performance, defendant agency informed plaintiff that it considered the project a public works requiring compliance with prevailing wage law, Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 1720 et seq. Thereafter, plaintiff filed suit for declaratory relief, and the trial court entered summary judgment in plaintiff's favor. On appeal, defendants, agency and officials, argued that a public agency was unable to avoid the wage law provisions by contracting to purchase the completed project from a private third party rather than contracting directly. The court affirmed. The court ruled that the trial court's determination that defendant's adjudication was accomplished without adherence to due process was justified because no notice and hearing procedure was utilized. Moreover, defendant agency was estopped from denying that the project was private because plaintiff relied on that representation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Superior Court of Napa County (California) which convicted defendant of rape and simple assault.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought to exclude for purposes of impeachment evidence of three prior felonies. The trial court deferred the matter, although it stated it would rule before trial. However, a new judge determined that he would not rule until after defendant testified. Defendant did not testify and he was found guilty of rape and simple assault. The trial court enhanced his convictions for having a prior serious felony conviction. The court of appeal affirmed. Postponing a ruling on the motion to exclude the use of prior convictions to impeach until after defendant testified was unusual because it impinged upon his right to testify or not to testify. The threat of impeachment was a coercive force that would compel a defendant to testify against his wishes. However, based on controlling case law, the court found that the trial court was allowed to wait. That law found that a trial court must have known the precise nature of a defendant's testimony in order to balance its probative value against prejudicial effect. Such knowledge was unknowable if a defendant, as in this case, did not testify.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal affirmed the conviction of defendant for rape and simple assault.

The trial court could do this because it could not have known the precise nature of defendant's testimony in order to balance its probative value against prejudicial effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff uninsured motorist was involved in an automobile collision and obtained an arbitration award as recompense for personal injuries caused by the negligent driving of defendant. Alleging personal injuries arising from the same collision to himself, defendant sought and received money from his insurer under his uninsured motorist protection. Plaintiff was without notice and had no access or involvement in those proceedings. The trial court thereafter nullified the arbitration award and entered judgment in favor of defendant and plaintiff appealed. The court determined that 1983 Cal. Stat. ch. 1252, &sect; 10, failed to provide any procedure to protect plaintiff's interest in the arbitration award. The court concluded that ch. 1252 could not reach those remedial or deterrent objectives by allowing an unbridled private power to assault the uninsured motorist's protected property rights in direct violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. Therefore, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners sued respondent state water board, alleging that respondent's plan to prevent increased surface runoff was unconstitutional and resulted in a regulatory taking of their property without just compensation. Appellants sought review after the lower court granted judgment on the pleadings to respondent. The appellate court affirmed the judgment, finding that the plan was constitutional. However, the court modified the judgment to dismiss the taking claim on the ground that it was not ripe for review because appellants failed to seek just compensation or an administrative determination. The court found that Cal. Water Code &sect; 13170 permitted respondent to adopt a water quality control plan and that the Federal Water Pollution Control Act did not preclude it from utilizing broader authority than mandated to regulate nonpoint sources of pollution. As such, the court found that respondent's waste discharge permit system was constitutional. Because the plan enabled each landowner to show that his building proposal, though in excess of that permitted, did not increase water discharge, the court found that appellants were not denied due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment to one of dismissal with respect to appellant landowners' claim that a plan by respondent state water board amounted to a regulatory taking because appellants did not seek a determination from respondent or just compensation, both prerequisites to alleging a taking. The court affirmed the remainder of the judgment, holding that the plan did not exceed respondent's statutory and constitutional authority.</SPAN></P>

When a storm dumped several inches and flooded the area, many buildings on certain portions of appellant's camp were destroyed. Appellee, the County Flood Control District, passed a regulatory interim ordinance which prohibited temporarily certain uses of appellant's land which was previously flooded until studies were performed on any likelihood of reoccurrence. The ordinance prohibited the reconstruction of buildings only on certain portions of appellant's land, and allowed other use of that land. Appellant filed an inverse condemnation action and claimed an unconstitutional taking had occurred under Cal.Const. art. I, &sect; 19. Particularly, appellant claimed appellee was liable under Cal. Govt. Code &sect; 835. This &sect; 835 action was dismissed by the trial and appellate court, and the Supreme Court of California ruled that compensatory damages could be awarded if a taking occurred, but remanded to the appellate court the issue of whether there was a taking. The appellate court held that no taking occurred where the regulatory action was temporary, intended to advance public safety interests, and allowed certain uses of appellant's land.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Real party in interest claimant successfully moved for the return of currency seized during his arrest on a domestic matter, arguing that a precondition of a forfeiture was a drug-related arrest and further that there must have been probable cause at the seizure of property for forfeiture. The people sought a writ of mandate to overturn the lower court's order. The court found that the government had the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence, under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11488.4(i)(4), that the property was subject to forfeiture within Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11470. The court concluded that state law did not require a drug arrest to sustain a forfeiture. The court ruled that the issues of constitutionality and of statutory probable cause for the forfeiture were satisfied, because the initial seizure was part of a legitimate search for a weapon followed by a protective inventory search, and there was probable cause to believe the money was the fruit of narcotics transactions in light of all the evidence. Petition was granted, instructing the trial court to vacate its order and to deny real party in interest's request for return of the currency.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which entered a judgment of conviction after a jury found appellant guilty of two counts of receiving stolen property. Appellant challenged the trial court's instruction as to the evidentiary effect of his possession of recently stolen property, contending that the instruction unconstitutionally shifted the burdens of proof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, appellant was convicted of two counts of receiving stolen property and challenged his conviction, contending that Cal. Jury Instructions - Criminal No. 2.15 assumed the property was &quot;recently&quot; stolen and deprived the jury of the opportunity to decide that fact, that the evidence did not warrant giving a bracketed portion of the instruction referring to &quot;false statements,&quot; and that the instruction was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's order, holding that it assumed the jury determined whether the property was &quot;recently&quot; stolen before it considered the inference of guilt permitted by the instruction, and that the jury reasonably could have concluded that appellant's possession of a stolen car within one month of the theft lead to an inference that he knew of the car's &quot;recently&quot; stolen nature. Evidence of appellant's intentionally false statement regarding the property's ownership warranted reference to the &quot;false statements&quot; portion of the instruction. The court held that the instruction did not compel the jury to find guilty knowledge based on slight corroborative evidence, and that there was no constitutionally suspect presumption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment convicting appellant of two counts of receiving stolen property, because the jury instruction at issue did not deprive the jury of an opportunity to decide an essential fact, the trial court did not err in giving certain portions of the instruction which were supported by sufficient evidence, and the instruction did not create a constitutionally suspect presumption of guilty knowledge.</SPAN></P>

Respondent superior court denied the motion, finding by clear and convincing evidence that the prior conviction was constitutional. Petitioner sought a writ of mandate against respondent, and the court denied the for writ because respondent used a higher standard of proof than was required due to the fact that the parties did not waive jury trial on the allegation. The court held that petitioner's motion was the equivalent of a Cal. Penal Code &sect; 995 motion requiring the pretrial challenge to be based upon reasonable cause to bind over for trial on the special circumstance allegation. The court held that the actual determination of a prior conviction's constitutional validity was a jury question to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, of which such proof could consist of custom and habit evidence, under Cal.

Defendant reaffirmed its earlier resolution approving the project without imposing any additional mitigation measures. On appeal, at issue was whether defendant abused its discretion in reapproving the project by failing to consider additional mitigation measures in the areas of child care, open space, and housing. The court found project-specific or cumulative impacts on the availability of child care programs were not environmental impacts and, therefore, defendant had no duty under CEQA to condition project reapproval on exactions from the project sponsor in this area.

The entry of a judgment implementing a court's order occurs routinely for a number of valid reasons.  Smith's implicit quarrel with the judgment here is that it removes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">all</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> the defendants when only a single defendant brought the motion.

Petitioner argued that the extension deprived him of a vested right to the repose of the cause of action under the previous one-year period.

On review, the court again denied the writ, finding that enlargement of limitations operated prospectively unless a statute expressly provided otherwise, which &sect; 340.1 did. The legislature had the power to retroactively extend a civil statute of limitations to revive a cause of action time-barred under a former limitations period.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Six defendants were charged with theft in an oil-stealing scheme. A preliminary examination commenced on a 25-count complaint. The magistrate granted motions to suppress that were made by defendant A, oil company representative, and defendant B, distributor. The case was dismissed without prejudice on the state's motion. The state's second complaint alleged 70 counts based on the same transactions. Defendants challenged the propriety of the second filing under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1538.5(d), and requested application of collateral estoppel. The second magistrate rejected the arguments, denied renewed motions to suppress, and held defendants to answer. Thereafter, defendants A and B moved to dismiss plaintiff 's information filed in the trial court. The trial court allowed all defendants to join the motions, which were denied. No contest plea agreement was reached. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgments of conviction, concluding that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1538.5(j) applied, the second filing and issue relitigation were proper, and the trial court erred in finding that other defendants had standing to challenge the search of defendant B's business.

Another defendant, an oil company representative, had standing to object to the search of his home, but his challenge was without merit because state law allowed for refiling of the complaint when he had not been held to answer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent satellite disk owners had placed disks on the roofs of their homes. Appellant city subsequently enacted an ordinance that regulated the antennas in a residential zone. The ordinance required an owner to obtain a conditional use permit. Respondents applied for permits. Appellant conditioned the issuance of the permits on relocation of the antennas to the ground and in a way that the antennas would be screened from street and surrounding property views. Administrative appeals were exhausted. Respondents filed a class action suit to restrain enforcement of the ordinance and for damages. Respondents argued the ordinance was a violation of 47 C.F.R. &sect; 25.104. The trial court granted a preliminary injunction that restrained appellant's enforcement of the ordinance, which was affirmed on appeal. The court determined that appellant's ordinance did not enact specific screening or placement requirements for the antennas which gave unduly broad discretion to administrative officials in light of the Federal Communication Commission's requirements that aesthetic objectives had to be clearly defined and take into account respondents' federal rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The preliminary injunction in favor of respondent satellite disk owners was affirmed.

In each suit, the trial court entered judgments favorable to the respondents. Petitioner sought appellate review, and the matters were consolidated before the appellate court. On review, the court noted that petitioner conceded that L.A., Cal., City Charter &sect; 12 precluded the discharge of permanent employees except for written cause. As such, the issue for determination was whether the particular termination procedures employed satisfied due process requirements of a full and fair disciplinary hearing. In reversing the judgments for respondents, the appellate court concluded that respondents were afforded a hearing and an opportunity to refute the charges before an administrative committee. The appellate court rejected respondents' argument that a panel reviewing a departmental disciplinary decision must be able to override the department's decision of what it believes to be an appropriate penalty; rather, due process was satisfied where the reviewing body determined whether sufficient evidence upheld the findings of misconduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city leased a ship and appurtenant real property to respondent lessee. At the time the lease was executed, 40 years was the maximum term permitted under appellant city's charter for the lease of appellant city's real property. Both parties were aware that a charter amendment would appear on the ballot one month later which, if approved, would extend the maximum term to 66 years. The parties provided in the lease that the term of the lease would be extended if the charter amendment was approved. Voters approved the charter amendment. Appellant county's tax assessor valued the lease three years later but revalued it two years later on the basis that the automatic increase in the lease's term from 40 to 66 years was a reappraisal event. Respondent was granted a refund of the additional taxes it paid. The judgment was affirmed because the automatic extension of the term of possession under the provision of the original lease did not constitute a second change in ownership within the meaning of Cal. Const. art. XIII A, &sect; 2. Indeed, the evidence showed the assessor had from the beginning interpreted the parties' intent to be to create a 66-year lease, not a 40-year lease.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the trial court granting plaintiff injunctive relief preventing defendant from using any information learned through its examination of plaintiff's product. The court reversed and held that the product had already been sold on the open market and was not a trade secret. The uncontradicted evidence showed that plaintiff sold the product to the public. In addition, the court rejected the contention that defendant breached or participated in a breach of the software licensing agreement because the preliminary injunction did not refer to the software and the license did not prevent a buyer from operating the machine, disassembling its hardware, studying its functions, and comparing it with other machines. Moreover, the internal padlocks could not protect the secrecy of a machine because it had been disclosed to the public and nothing that an examination of the machine discloses can be a trade secret. In addition, the law did not prohibit reverse engineering, but rather encouraged such efforts by giving to the competitor who invests substantial resources the opportunity to hold in legally protected confidence the results of its labor.</SPAN></P>

The court initially determined that appellants were free to challenge the consent judgment because there was no clear and compelling evidence that appellants had waived their fundamental rights. The court affirmed the denial to vacate the judgment regarding restrictions on the decoration of appellants' residence and the time period during which they could be displayed because it found that the content neutral restrictions were reasonable. It reversed the denial regarding restrictions on the advertising of the residence, which it found was a prior restraint on speech, because it held that the restrictions were not narrowly drawn to protect respondent's interests.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant college and intervenor chain bookstore appealed the order of the Superior Court of Marin County (California), which granted summary judgment to plaintiffs, privately owned bookstores, and granted a permanent injunction that prohibited defendant and intervenor from operating a full scale bookstore on campus property. Defendant and intervenor claimed that Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 81676 was unconstitutional as applied by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant college contracted with intervenor chain bookstore to manage its campus bookstores. The trial court granted summary judgment to plaintiffs, privately owned bookstores, on plaintiffs' request for a permanent injunction and restrained defendant and intervenor from selling any books, except textbooks necessary for college course work, because it was beyond defendant's authority to operate a full scale bookstore on campus under Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 81676. The court affirmed order and held that &sect; 81676 included language of limitation because it covered the sale of textbooks, not books in general, and the usual and ordinary meaning of textbooks was books used in the study of a given subject. Defendant and intervenor also argued that the trial court's application of &sect; 81676 made them suppressors of U.S. Const. amend. I rights. The court held, however, that defendant's and intervenor's bookstores were not public forums in spite of being open to the public, thus, &sect; 81676 as applied was not unconstitutional. Finally, the court held that injunctive relief was appropriate because it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the amount of compensation that would afford adequate relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs, privately owned bookstores, and the injunction issued against defendant college and intervenor chain bookstore because of the plain language of the statutory law and because campus bookstores were not public forums; thus, the statutory limitations placed upon the operation of the bookstores did not offend either state or federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the implementation of the wage reduction did not sever the causal relationship between the dispute and petitioners' decision to leave work, and that petitioners went on strike because they chose to do so.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city passed an ordinance, Montclair Municipal Code &sect; 3-5.504, that imposed a 6 percent tax on the price of an admission ticket to any event. Appellant theater corporations filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that the admissions tax impermissibly burdened their rights under the U.S. Const. amend. I without adequate justification. The trial court held that the tax was constitutional and entered judgment for respondent. On appeal, the court reversed because only a very small percentage of businesses in the city paid the tax and because 90 percent of the admissions tax burdened only four businesses. Here, appellants' uncontradicted evidence demonstrated that the tax was not targeted to all businesses but only to those engaged in protected speech. The court held that a statute challenged under U.S. Const. amend. I must be tested by its operation and effect and found that the burden of the tax fell disproportionately upon businesses engaged in protected speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">County voters approved Proposition 62, a statutory initiative providing that a local ordinance imposing general taxes after the proposition's effective date was valid only if adopted by a two-thirds vote of the legislative body. Appellee county brought suit seeking a declaration that the proposition was unconstitutional for violating the referendum provisions of Cal. Const. art. II, &sect; 9(a). The trial court entered judgment declaring the initiative unconstitutional, and appellant county controller sought review, arguing that the voter approval requirement for local tax enactments was an initiative authorized by Cal. Const. art. II, &sect; 8, rather than an invalid referendum. In affirming, the appellate court concluded that the future tax provisions amounted to a constitutionally proscribed referendum. Referendums were directed to enacted statutes or ordinances that had not yet taken effect, and the state constitution expressly provided that the referendum powers reserved to the people did not extend to tax levies. County voters had no referendum power to repeal a tax ordinance, and they could not do so indirectly by labeling their attempt an initiative rather than a referendum.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed, as the state constitution mandated that referendum powers reserved to the people did not extend to tax levies. Where the statutory initiative affected the validity of recently enacted local taxing ordinances, it was a constitutionally proscribed referendum and thus invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted plaintiff health center a preliminary injunction against defendant anti-abortion citizen protesters. One of plaintiff's clients was recognized by a defendant who revealed her identity and purpose.

Plaintiff claimed defendants were violating its clients right to privacy. The trial court refused the requested order but amended the preliminary injunction by enjoining defendants from identifying or disclosing the identity of anyone entering or leaving the center. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court judgment, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to enter the injunctive order because plaintiff's claim of privacy was based on mere recognition on public streets and its clients had no reasonable expectation of anonymity on public sidewalks and streets. The court held that plaintiff failed to show that defendants had ample alternatives for communicating to their target audience in a public forum.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant inmate of escape with force and violence in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 4532(b). Defendant appealed, alleging his right to a jury trial was violated because the information, jury instructions, and verdict form did not present force as an element of forcible escape but as a separate allegation to be found true. He claimed because that procedure required the jury to render a special verdict from which the trial court drew the legal conclusion of guilt, it violated his right to a general jury verdict of guilt. The court affirmed, holding that by finding defendant guilty of simple escape and that he used force, the jury applied legal principles to the facts, leaving the court to make operative the jury's verdict. Thus, there was no interference with defendant's constitutional right to a jury trial. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in refusing to accept his Alford plea. The court noted that defendant made statements to the court raising the question of whether any plea would be voluntary; therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to accept the plea.</SPAN></P>

Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 6362, and rejected appellants' U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV attack on Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 1590 (1975) (formerly Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After exhausting their administrative remedies before respondent State Board of Equalization, appellant, publisher and printers, sought a refund of sales tax collected on printing charges on grounds that appellant publisher's advertising guide was a newspaper or periodical under the Sales and Use Tax Law, Cal.

The trial court upheld the denial of the refund, and rejected the constitutional attacks on the validity of &sect; 1590. Appellants sought review. The appellate court found that the distinction in &sect; 1590 was content-neutral. Moreover, commercial speech was accorded less protection than noncommercial speech. The appellate court affirmed the trial court judgment because respondent was permitted to treat commercial speech differently than noncommercial speech in &sect; 1590 and the differential tax treatment accorded advertising guides was rationally related to a legitimate state interest and did not violate equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that the order constituted a delegation of judicial power in violation of Cal. Const. art. III, &sect; 3, that the order denied appellant due process, and that the order was not supported by substantial evidence. The court affirmed and held that respondent, which was acting as the probation officer, acted as an arm of a court in the best interests of the minors. The court held that a nonjudicial board or officer may be authorized to perform quasi-judicial powers to determine facts and exercise discretion. The court held that there was no due process violation because respondent was charged with the burden of representing the state in seeking the best interests of the children. The court held that there was ample evidence to support the order because the children felt neglected, unloved, and angry at appellant. The court held that forced contact would not be beneficial to the children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff client retained defendant attorney to institute a medical malpractice action and the parties executed a contingent fee agreement. As a requirement for defendant's representation, plaintiff waived the protection of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 6146, which placed a limit on contingency fee agreements. After the malpractice suit was settled and costs deducted, defendant took 40 percent pursuant to the agreement and refused plaintiff's request for a refund of the fee that exceeded that permitted under &sect; 6146. Plaintiff filed a suit against defendant for violation of &sect; 6146. Defendant argued that the prescribed fee limitations precluded retention by injured persons of adequate counsel because it was not economically feasible. The trial court held plaintiff had waived protection of the statute. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and held that plaintiff had not and could not waive protection of &sect; 6146 because such waiver was precluded by Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3513, whereby the legislature precluded contingency fee agreements providing for rates in excess of the limits set in the statute.

Plaintiff contended that the court abused its discretion in not permitting the amendment and incorrectly applied the law. The court on review found that a party who waited 18 months before attempting to amend, and then did so only after trial had commenced, and who offered no excuse for the failure, could hardly complain when the request to amend was denied. The court held that it could not say that trial judge abused his discretion. The court also held that the trial court correctly determined that the Renton test had to be applied to plaintiff's zoning scheme.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mental patient filed an action against defendant police department in which she sought to regain weapons confiscated pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 8102. Plaintiff also sought to have the statute declared unconstitutional. The trial court ordered the return of plaintiff's property and dismissed plaintiff's constitutional claim. Upon review, the court reversed. The court held that Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 8102 was unconstitutional because it did not provide plaintiff with a sufficient remedy to regain possession of her property to satisfy due process requirements under U.S. Const. amend. XIV; Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The court reasoned that the statute did not contain the proper provisions for a hearing because it failed to provide adequate notice of time and place. The court found the statute's provision that provided a property owner could retain his or her property by filing an action in a superior court was not sufficient notice of a hearing because it required the owner to institute the action rather than the department. The court held that a statute permitting peremptory seizure of property required a provision within its own ambit for administrative review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, city and administrator, allowed an unlit menorah to be displayed in the city hall rotunda near a decorated Christmas tree, and appellant taxpayer filed a lawsuit for injunctive and declaratory relief. The trial court granted respondents' summary judgment motion and dismissed the matter. The court affirmed because under the three-part test, the display did not violate the establishment clause of U.S. Const. amend. I. The court found that the display had a secular purpose of providing cultural and educational development, did not have an inherent religious significance like other objects, and did not show excessive entanglement between religion and government in the context of the rotunda's regular use for historical, cultural, and artistic displays. The court found that the display did not violate the state constitution under the &quot;preference&quot; test because there was no lack of comparable recognition of other religious symbols, and the menorah did not focus attention of a religious doctrine or portray a central tenet of religion. The court found that the unlit menorah was more of a museum piece than a religious symbol.</SPAN></P>

The court found that charging defendant with, and sentencing him under, the more severe of two overlapping enhancement statutes did not violate his equal protection rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee and the old board of hospital directors entered into a contract that required immediate termination of appellant employee and provided for payments to appellant employee. The contract contained an arbitration clause and provided for attorney fees to the prevailing party. Subsequently, appellant new board voted to rescind that agreement, and appellant employee filed suit. Respondent taxpayers filed a complaint for declaratory relief, that original contract expired and that the amendment to the contract and the buyout agreement were void and unconstitutional. Appellant employee filed a petition to compel arbitration. The trial court denied the petition pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1281.2(b), (c). On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that respondents' allegations of appellant employee's violations of the Cal.

Code &sect; 23152 in the Municipal Court for the Santa Barbara Judicial District of Santa Barbara County (California), challenged their enhanced sentences, arguing that the use of their prior convictions within the past seven years under Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order enhancing the sentences of appellants, who were each convicted of drunk driving under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23152. Noting that the last time appellants pleaded guilty to drunk driving, Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23102(d) provided for enhanced punishment of a person previously convicted of drunk driving within the past five years, the court held that Cal. Veh. Code &sect;&sect; 23165, 23170, and 23175, extending the period to seven years, were not ex post facto laws. All three statutes, it noted, were in force before appellants' present convictions and apprised them of the consequences of a new violation. It also rejected their arguments that that the prior convictions expired once the five years passed, that their earlier plea bargains amounted to a promise that the convictions would be used for only five years, and that their not being informed that the law could change violated their due process rights. Finally, it rejected appellants' arguments that the seven-year statutes were being applied retroactively, finding that this would be the case only if the statutes had been enacted after their offenses and before sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment denying his petition for writ of mandate to prevent the California Department of Motor Vehicles (department) from suspending his driver's license based on two convictions for driving under the influence. Appellant claimed that the second conviction, which occurred in Minnesota, was unconstitutional because the Minnesota record was silent with respect to appellant's express waiver of his constitutional right of confrontation. The court found that such a waiver could not be presumed from a silent record. The court therefore reversed the judgment and directed the trial court to issue a writ of mandate commanding the department to rescind its suspension order. The court further explained that before the department may suspend appellant's driving privileges on the basis of an out-of-state conviction, appellant must be allowed to challenge the constitutionality of the conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted appellant of numerous charges including rape, oral copulation by force, sodomy, and assault by means of force. Appellant sought review, alleging the application of Cal. Civ. Proc. Code 198(b), requiring jurors to have sufficient knowledge of the English language, deprived him his right to an impartial jury under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, in that his jury was not one drawn from a representative cross-section of the community. The court disagreed and affirmed the convictions. The court noted that to prove deprivation of an impartial jury, appellant was required to show that non-English-speaking citizens were a distinctive group in the community, but that appellant failed to provide any proof for that assertion. There was no showing that non-English-speaking citizens acted as a class or shared a common perspective. Furthermore, appellant's assertion that such jurors should not be excluded and should have been provided with personal interpreters placed too heavy a burden on the court and on other jurors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's convictions were affirmed because the statute at issue requiring the exclusion of potential jurors who did not possess sufficient knowledge of English was not unconstitutional, and appellant was not denied his right to a jury comprising a representative cross-section of the community. The matter was remanded for resentencing in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

License revocation was based on alleged child molestation both on and off the day care center premises. The court affirmed the trial court decision. Based on the competent testimony of a child witness, there was substantial evidence that molestation occurred on-site. The Department was authorized to revoke appellant's license on the basis of child molestation accusations that did not occur on-site because there was substantial evidence that misconduct was related to the operation or maintenance of a child day care center. Such alleged off-site misconduct was inimical to the health, morals, welfare, or safety of an individual who received services for the child day care center. The alleged off-site molestation was relevant to the issue of license revocation. Revocation of appellant's license did not improperly interfere with appellant's right to marry a suspected child molester under the rational basis test.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insured challenged an order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), prohibiting appellant's attorney from representing her in a certain capacity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent insurance company filed an action for declaratory relief alleging that appellant insured's continued employment of inexperienced counsel to represent her in an underlying action was a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and her duty to cooperate with her insurer. The trial court held in favor of respondent, and appellant sought review. The court held that an order, pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 2860(c), that terminated counsel's participation as counsel paid by the insurer was directly appealable as the equivalent of an injunction disqualifying current counsel from acting in a Cumis capacity. The court further held that the provisions of Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 2860 were not unconstitutional on due process, equal protection or separation of powers grounds.  Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 2860(c) applied to Cumis counsel retained by an insured prior to the effective date of &sect; 2860(c) because it was a codification of existing law and was procedural in nature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of a concealable firearm by a convicted felon, various drug offenses, and a prior prison term. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1538.5, which the trial court denied. Defendant appealed the denial of his motion to suppress, arguing that the warrantless search of his car was not a lawful parole search. The court reversed and held that the officer possessed reasonable suspicion to conduct the parole search. However, defendant was entitled to suppression of the evidence seized because the officer did not possess probable cause to believe that contraband or evidence of a crime would be found in defendant's vehicle trunk. Moreover, the court found that because the vehicle was already impounded, the officer had ample time to attempt to secure a warrant, but he chose to rely on the parole condition as his authority for the search. Further, the prosecution failed to establish that the search was necessary for effective parole supervision, that it was related to legitimate parole administration rather than ordinary law enforcement, or even that the parole agent had prior notice of the search.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the denial of defendant's motion to suppress. The court held that reasonable suspicion existed to justify a parole search, but the officer did not possess probable cause to justify the search of defendant's trunk. Further, the court found that neither the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule nor the inevitable discovery doctrine applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a complaint after being involved in an automobile accident that occurred on May 9, 1981.

On that date, respondent's attorney appeared and, at appellant's behest, sought to continue the trial to November 14, 1986. Respondent's attorney was to give notice to appellant of the new trial date but neglected to do so. Neither attorney appeared for trial and respondent moved for dismissal under the five-year statute. Appellant sought relief under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 473 on grounds of surprise, inadvertence and excusable neglect, as well as on grounds of estoppel and waiver. The trial court granted respondent's motion for dismissal. A motion for reconsideration was denied. The court affirmed the dismissal, holding that failure to monitor dates crucial to his lawsuit did not constitute a cause beyond his control so as to trigger application of the impossible, impracticable, or futile exceptions of &sect; 473.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal because the failure to appear at trial or know the date of trial constituted lack of diligence, did not involve circumstances beyond appellant's control, and did not rise to the level of impossibility, impracticability, or futility.</SPAN></P>

Respondent nonresident made a special appearance by moving to quash the service of summons on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction and inconvenient forum. The trial court granted the motion, holding that the suit should be commenced in Nevada. Appellant contended the trial court erred inasmuch as the conception, birth, and rearing of the minor in California constituted sufficient grounds to maintain personal jurisdiction over respondent pursuant to the specific statutory authority found in Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 7007 and under general due process principles. The court reversed the judgment, finding that section 7007 satisfied due process requirements and lawfully subjected respondent to the jurisdiction of California. The court found that respondent's sexual act resulting in the birth of a child imposed a substantial burden upon the mother and upon the state because the mother was impecunious. Therefore, the court held that it was reasonable the state should exercise judicial jurisdiction over respondent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landlord challenged a judgment from the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), which denied his writ of administrative mandamus and affirmed respondent board's decision to lower the tenants' rental rate and assess a penalty against appellant in the form of reimbursement to the tenants of overpaid rent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landlord rented a family residence to tenants and increased their rental rate over the next few years. Thereafter, the tenants filed a petition with respondent board claiming that appellant charged excessive rent and had not registered the property as required by local ordinance. The tenants sought a rate adjustment and reimbursement. Following a hearing, in which appellant testified that his costs exceeded the rent charged, respondent set a new rental rate, concluded that tenants overpaid appellant, and authorized the tenants to withhold the rent until the overcharged amount was satisfied. Appellant challenged respondent's decision and petitioned for a writ of administrative mandamus, which the trial court denied. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed the judgment. First, the court held respondent did not exercise, nor did the underlying statute authorize, judicial power contrary to the Cal. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1. Further, the court held that appellant was not denied a fair return on his investment by respondent's decision. The court reasoned respondent acted in accordance with the ordinance in denying appellant's introduction of evidence regarding his expenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment denying appellant landlord's writ for administrative mandamus and affirming respondent board's decision to reduce the tenants' rent and the tenants' entitlement to reimbursement of overpaid rent. The court held that respondent acted within its capacity and only acted in its ministerial capacity when determining the rental reduction and penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of assault with a deadly weapon. After the jury returned a verdict on one of the counts, the trial court substituted an alternate juror for one of the jurors that had deliberated. Defendant appealed and argued that after a jury rendered a verdict, the trial court could not excuse a juror, substitute an alternate, and allow the changed jury to deliberate for other verdicts. The court affirmed. The court held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1089 allowed the substitution of a juror at any time before or after final submission of a case to the jury. The court held further that it was constitutional under both the U.S. and California constitutions to substitute jurors after deliberations began. However, an instruction had to be given to the jury to begin fresh deliberations and not resume old ones. Per federal precedent, failure to give such an instruction was an error. Here, the trial court had given the proper instruction by using Cal. Jury Instructions, Civil No. 17.51. The court also gave weight to the case not being close on the facts and identification being the only issue.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected his argument, and upheld his sentence. It held that appellant had failed to show that similarly situated persons were treated unequally, inasmuch as the legislative scheme subjects all defendants convicted of a serious felony who had a prior serious felony conviction to enhancement under the section appellant was sentenced under, regardless of the washout provision of other sentencing statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a police officer who, subsequent to his appeal of termination of his appointment, was retroactively reinstated to all his benefits as a police officer.

On appeal, the court determined that defendant did not have permit to carry the gun at the material time. It noted that although defendant was retroactively reinstated to his benefits pursuant to Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 19584, nothing suggested that the statute retroactively entitled defendant to non-benefits emoluments, such as carrying a concealed weapon on his person without a permit. Furthermore, the court held that the statute did not excuse defendant from compliance with the law during the period of suspension or termination. It affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer issued a surety bond securing the workers' compensation obligations of employer on October 28, 1975.

Employer filed a petition in bankruptcy and the self insurers' security fund (fund) was ordered to assume its workers' compensation obligations. Fund sought reimbursement from insurer for the employer's obligations based on injuries occurring prior to issuance of the insurer's bond. The trial court sustained demurrers of respondent department of industrial relations, without leave to amend, based on a lack of jurisdiction. The court held that Cal. Lab.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county sought to prevent respondent club from playing the game pai gow in respondent club's gaming establishments based on Cal. Penal Code &sect; 330, which made percentage games illegal. The trial court granted a permanent injunction restraining and enjoining appellant from preventing the playing of pai gow in respondent's gaming establishments. The court reversed the judgment. The court found that although the term percentage game was not statutorily defined, that term had been the subject of judicial interpretation. Percentage game was defined as encompassing any game of chance from which the house collected money calculated as a portion of wagers made or sums won in play, exclusive of charges or fees for use of space and facilities. The court found under the injunction, respondent was allowed to charge a rental fee from the participants in the game based on the amount each participant wagered. The court concluded that it was a percentage game and violated Cal. Penal Code &sect; 330.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the challenged provision of &sect; 1596.871(e) was constitutional as applied. The court ruled that this statutory classification was rationally related to the legitimate government purpose of protecting day care children from any potential risk of harm by denying a license to applicants who were either themselves convicted of certain felonies or who had such felons working or residing on the proposed day care premises. The court determined that this provision was narrowly drawn to limit the scope of the disqualification to only those convicted of specified felonies and not to all crimes. No exemption under &sect; 1596.871(e) applied to appellant's husband because he was convicted of armed robbery, a specified disqualifying violent felony.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 666, with a prior burglary and robbery under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 211, and the denial of his motion to suppress evidence of his prior conviction of first degree burglary. Two store employees accused defendant of leaving the store without paying for cigarettes. One of the employees reached into defendant's pocket and found a pack of cigarettes. Defendant was detained in the back room of the store until police arrived. Defendant argued that the search was illegal because the employees were performing a public function. The court held that the search was illegal under state law because detention of defendant until police arrived constituted state action, but that Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 28(d) required that federal law be applied to exclusion of evidence question. The court affirmed the judgment and the suppression of evidence and held that federal law did not require exclusion of the evidence because no official of the government, federal or state, had any connection with the wrongful seizure or any knowledge of it until after the fact.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed because federal law applied to the exclusion of evidence obtained while defendant was held until the police arrived for stealing cigarettes, and did not require exclusion because no official of the government, federal or state, had any connection with the wrongful seizure or any knowledge of it until after the fact.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court did err in failing to obtain a separate jury waiver from defendant on the special circumstance allegation. However, employing the harmless error analysis, the court found that the error was harmless as defendant had counsel and was sentenced by an impartial adjudicator. Moreover, the record established the correct sentence was imposed not only beyond a reasonable doubt, but beyond a shadow of a doubt. With respect to his confession, the court found no evidence that defendant's Miranda waiver and confession were anything but knowingly and voluntary. The court followed the United States Supreme Court holding that a noncoercive confession obtained following the provision of a Miranda warning would not be excluded even though it followed a noncoercive admission obtained without the benefit of a Miranda warning. The judgment below was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff boat owners filed an action against defendant San Diego Unified Port District seeking declaratory and injunctive relief pertaining to a notice to remove boats from a harbor. The trial court dissolved a temporary restraining order and denied plaintiffs' motion for a temporary injunction. On appeal, plaintiff contended that San Diego, Cal., Unified Port District Ordinance 1200 was unconstitutional and void. The court rejected these contentions and found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a temporary injunction. The court held that defendant was authorized to adopt all ordinances and resolutions to carry out its duties delegated to it as trustee over the tidelands and submerged lands of the San Diego Bay. Defendant's regulation of anchorage was a proper exercise of the powers under its enabling act. Inconvenience to plaintiffs and a diminution of value of plaintiffs' vessels did not constitute a taking or damaging of the property or an improper exercise of defendant's powers.

The court held that because the district attorney's policy and the trial court's acquiescence in that policy clearly offended the separation of powers doctrine, a peremptory writ was required. The peremptory writ directed the trial court to adopt and enforce its own procedures for readiness or settlement conferences within the limits of court rules.

The court granted petitioner her habeas corpus relief and found that the statute was overbroad and violated the free speech protections of U.S. Const. amend. I and Cal. Const. art.

Thus the court found the statute objectionable because it treated a telephone call made midday to the complaint department of a large retail store identically with a telephone call made to a private residence at 3 a.m. The court also found that just because petitioner's actions did not constitute protected speech did not mean that she did not have the right to bring a constitutional challenge to the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner city adopted a parcel tax consisting of an annual flat fee assessed against city property holdings. Its stated purpose was to raise revenue that would be deposited in the city's general fund to provide revenue to maintain and enhance municipal services. After the tax was approved by the city's voters as Measure M, respondent, the city's finance director, declined to enforce it on the ground that it violated the constitutional requirement that all property be taxed according to value. The city maintained the tax was a valid excise tax and sought a writ of mandate to compel respondent to enforce and collect the tax. The court denied the petition. Based on its incidents, and from the natural and legal effect of its language, Measure M was a tax on property. The tax was imposed on all property regardless of the use to which the property was put and it was due annually at fixed times. Measure M failed to apportion the tax by the type and extent of municipal services used. As a property tax, Measure M violated Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect;1, which provided that property was required to be assessed at the same percentage of fair market value. The parcel tax was a flat fee tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who was due to be released after serving a term of years for a forcible rape conviction, was required to accept inpatient treatment under a new statutory scheme, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 2962, because the trial court found him to be a severely mentally disordered offender. The statute was expressly retroactive and mandated a potentially onerous change in his terms of parole, without requiring a determination of whether he constituted a danger to the public. Appellant argued that the statute was unconstitutional. The court determined that the statute had overwhelmingly more penal attributes than therapeutic. As such, it violated constitutional ex post facto protections. Furthermore, the court held that the statute violated the equal protection clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because it did not require proof of any present dangerousness to the public by mentally disordered offenders, as required for other adult persons involuntarily committed for mental health treatment. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and held that appellant was entitled to parole without reference to the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of indefinite confinement was reversed because it was overwhelmingly more penal than therapeutic and was thus violative of ex post facto protections. Moreover, the applicable statute also violated equal protection because it mandated involuntary confinement and treatment of former prisoners who were mentally ill without proof of dangerousness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff developer sought review of a judgment that denied issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate directing defendant city to reinstate a conditional use permit. Pursuant to Fort Bragg, Cal., Municipal Code &sect; 18.76.100, use permits automatically expired if work had not commenced or a use established within one year of the issuance of the permit. The court found that the development project involved complex governmental and financial commitments and plaintiff was proceeding with a good faith intent to commence upon the proposed use, even though there had not been any actual construction at the site. The court held that it was unreasonable for the trial court to apply a standard concerned with the extent of construction alone to determine if the use permit automatically expired. Regarding the permits validity, the court held that defendant could not arbitrarily revoke the permit without cause, notice, and a hearing. Because plaintiff was not afforded notice of defendant's intention to consider revocation, any attempted revocation was a nullity. Accordingly, the judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court divided the parties' property pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 4800.2. The court found that &sect; 4800.2 abolished the rule that separate property contributions to community assets were presumed gifts to the community in the absence of a contrary agreement or understanding. The statute applied to proceedings commenced on or after January 1, 1984, and proceedings commenced before January 1, 1984, to the extent proceedings as to the division of the property were not final on January 1, 1984. The court found that there was not a sufficient basis for impairing vested property rights because the application of &sect; 4800.2 depended upon the date of the acquisition of the property in dispute. Because the trial court applied &sect; 4800.2 to property acquired before January 1, 1984, the court reversed and remanded the award to respondent of his separate property contribution to the residence. The court held that without a finding that the parties agreed to preserve a separate property interest, appellant's vested property interests were impaired without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted judgment to respondent. On appeal, appellants contended that Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 23013 was unconstitutional as a transfer of elected official's duties to an appointed official. The court rejected this contention, finding that Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 23013 did not infringe upon electoral power because the voters ratified the transfer of the county jail management away from appellant sheriff. Furthermore, appellant sheriff's duties were modifiable by the legislature because the legislature possessed plenary power to define appellant sheriff's duties. Therefore, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 23013 was not in conflict with the state constitution. The elimination of a portion of appellant sheriff's responsibilities did not infringe upon separation of powers because Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Orange County (California), which denied appellant declaratory relief and found that Proposition 62, a statewide statutory initiative passed in November 1986 which added Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 53720-53730, was constitutional. The initiative nullified appellant's utility users' tax unless the municipal electorate approved the levy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city enacted a utility users' tax effective January 1, 1987. California voters approved Proposition 62, a statutory initiative, in 1986. Sponsored by respondent political movement, the initiative added Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 53720-53730. As of November 15, 1988, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 53727(b) prohibited collection of a general tax enacted after July 31, 1985, unless a majority of appellant's voters approved it within two years of the date of the initiative. If voter approval was not forthcoming, any utility users' tax revenues realized after November 15, 1988, were offset by a reduction in appellant's property tax allocation. Appellant sought a declaration that Proposition 62 was unconstitutional and an injunction to restrain respondent county from withholding property tax monies. The trial court found in favor of respondents. The court reversed and held that Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 53727(b) was unconstitutional under Cal. Const. art. II, &sect; 9(a). The court further found that the severability clause contained in Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 53730 provided that the remainder of the proposition did not survive after finding partial unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions of residential burglaries and his prison sentence of 18 years and 4 months entered by the Superior Court of Fresno County (California). Among other things, defendant argued that the trial court erroneously denied his motions to suppress his confession as involuntary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two days after his arrest during an interview, defendant confessed to the charged burglaries and admitted involvement in other burglaries. At the time of the interview, defendant was suffering from heroin and cocaine withdrawal and had not slept since his arrest. Before he confessed, the officers told him if he worked with them they would give him some medication, take him outside, and get him some food other than jail food. At the interview, defendant did not have difficulty speaking, and the officers did not have to repeat any questions. Defendant was convicted of burglary, theft, and unlawful driving with a vehicle. He was sentenced to 18 years and 4 months in prison. The court affirmed and held that under the totality of the circumstances, the record supported the trial court's finding of voluntariness insofar as the issue of drug withdrawal was concerned. Further, the court held that the inducements that were purportedly offered were not the type that would have motivated defendant sufficiently to render his statement involuntary. However, the court remanded for resentencing and held that the trial court should have stated its reasons for imposing consecutive prison terms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions of residential burglaries because defendant's confession was voluntary. However, the court vacated defendant's sentence and remanded for resentencing after preparation and consideration of a new probation officer's report because the trial court failed to state reasons for imposing consecutive terms.</SPAN></P>

Rather, the trial court instructed the jury under Cal. Jury Inst. No. 2.13 and Cal. Jury Inst. No. 2.71, which, in effect, told the jury that the statements could be weighed and considered in resolving the issue of guilt. The court reversed the convictions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county filed suit against defendant school district for payment of the cost of an unsuccessful recall effort of certain members of the governing board of trustees. The trial court granted summary judgment for defendant, and plaintiff appealed. The court, in affirming the trial court's decision, interpreted the election and education statutes involved. The court held that Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 5424 referred only to the costs of an election that was held. Section 5424 said nothing about costs expended in preparation for an election, whether held or not. The court found that the legislature was aware of this distinction because other related statutes differentiated between the &quot;preparation for&quot; and the &quot;holding of&quot; elections and allocation of costs of these services between the county, local districts and municipalities.  Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 5303, Cal. Elec. Code &sect;&sect; 10000, 23524. The court found that the language of &sect; 5424 was clear and unambiguous and was susceptible of only one interpretation. The language of the section did not require districts within a county to pay costs expended by the county to determine that a recall election would not be held.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant was not required to pay the pre-election expenses of a recall election of school board trustees that was not held because the plain language of the statute did not provide for defendant to pay those expenses.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeal affirmed. The Sales and Use Tax Law, Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 6001 et seq., as applied to appellant was constitutional. Appellant pursued evangelistic goals by means including the sale of bibles, religious books, religious tapes, and other religious and nonreligious materials in the state of California. The determination whether such activities were religious or purely commercial was difficult to make, but the distinction was vital. The trial court properly found that appellant was a &quot;retailer&quot; within the meaning of the tax laws and that it had a sufficient nexus to California to allow imposition of the sales and use taxes. Neither the California Constitution nor the California Sales and Use Tax Law exempted religious organizations generally from sales and use taxes, other than for the serving of meals. California could justify limitations on religious liberty in the form of taxes as essential to accomplish an overriding governmental interest.</SPAN></P>

Respondent people argued that the statements were properly admitted under the newly enacted Proposition 8. The court noted that Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 28(d), known as Proposition 8, prohibited the exclusion of relevant evidence in any criminal proceeding with the exception of the application of any existing statutory rule of evidence relating to privilege or hearsay. The court agreed with respondent that Proposition 8 made the federal constitutional standard the sole determinant of admissibility. Under that standard, the court held that the trial court properly admitted the statements because there was no evidence of police misconduct when appellant invoked his right to remain silent and the second interview was conducted after an overnight interval and after appellant indicated his willingness to talk.

Respondent refused to issue the subpoenas until petitioner submitted the affidavit of materiality required by Cal.

Petitioner refused to submit the affidavit and sought a writ of mandate to compel issuance of the subpoenas, contending his equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7(a) were violated because the same requirement did not apply to witnesses in civil actions. The court denied the writ, finding that the distinction between criminal witnesses in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1330 and civil witnesses under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1992 did not constitute an equal protection violation because the legislative intent in the distinction pertained to the compensation of the witnesses and not the rights of the litigants.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction for involuntary manslaughter, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 192(b), in the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California). Defendant argued that the jury was incorrectly instructed in a matter of law and that the verdict was contrary to the evidence and the law regarding justifiable homicide, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 197(4). Defendant encountered a burglar and chased him, firing shots at the ground in front of the burglar. One of the shots ricocheted, striking and killing the burglar. The court looked to the use of deadly force to defend against the commission or attempt to commit a &quot;forcible and atrocious&quot; crime, which at common law included nighttime burglary. The court found defendant's conviction for involuntary manslaughter was not supported by the evidence and held that crimes which were felonies at common law were forcible and atrocious as a matter of law. Thus, the use of deadly force by private citizens to apprehend felons fleeing from the commission of common law felonies was justified under &sect; 197(4). The conviction was reversed, and the lower court was directed to enter a judgment of acquittal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment convicting defendant of involuntary manslaughter was reversed because the evidence did not support the conviction. The court held that crimes which were felonies at common law were forcible and atrocious as a matter of law and, therefore, justified deadly force by private citizens. The lower court was directed to enter a judgment of acquittal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent landlords sought to evict their tenants and remove controlled units from rental residential housing use. Appellants, City of Santa Monica and the Santa Monica Rent Control Board, filed suit for injunctive and declaratory relief, contending the evictions violated Santa Monica, Ca., City Charter art. XVIII, &sect;&sect; 1806 and 1803, were not authorized by the Ellis Act, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 7060 et seq., and the Ellis Act violated Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect;&sect; 5 and 7. The trial court denied appellants' application for preliminary injunction against two respondents, holding that the evictions were authorized by the Ellis Act and appellants failed to show the likelihood of prevailing on the merits. The reviewing court affirmed, holding that the Ellis Act preempted portions of appellant city's removal and eviction controls. The court found that &sect;&sect; 1806 and 1803 were invalid to the extent they conflicted with the Ellis Act by prohibiting residential landlords from evicting tenants in order to go out of the rental residential housing business.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During their marriage, appellant ex-wife and respondent ex-husband purchased a home. Respondent used his inheritance as a down payment. After filing for dissolution, the parties sold the house, and the trial court determined that the proceeds were respondent's separate property pursuant to Cal. Civil Code &sect; 4800.2. On review, the court found that prior to the enactment of &sect; 4800.2, the law was that separate property contributions to community assets were deemed gifts to the community absent an agreement to the contrary. However, &sect; 4800.2 provided that a party was entitled to reimbursement for separate property contributions toward the acquisition of community assets unless the contributing party executed a written waiver. While the court found that uniform treatment of property was a worthy goal, its advancement alone did not justify disrupting property rights that were acquired under the previous settled law. Therefore, the court found that the house should have been treated as a community asset, subject to equal division between the parties. The matter was reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The application was forwarded to an office which was to hold a lottery if the number of prior permitees were fewer than 150 under Cal. Fish &amp; Game Code &sect;&sect; 8568(b), 8570.

In so ruling, the appellate court noted that defendant was not a signatory to the contract. Further, defendant's foreclosure did not cause it to step into the shoes of the property owner.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Parolee was released from prison, and he killed decedent. Plaintiffs, decedent's kids and heirs, brought a wrongful death and civil rights suit against defendants, parole agent and state. The trial court sustained demurrers as to all claims based on conduct misleading decedent into believing parolee was not dangerous and left intact the claim based on state psychologist's failure to warn decedent of danger. Plaintiffs sought a writ of mandate seeking to compel reversal of the trial court's rulings. The wrongful death claim involved issues of breach of duty, proximate cause, and immunity. The civil rights claims involved issues of whether defendant state could be sued and whether defendants pursued an official policy under color of state law that caused decedent's death. The appellate court denied the petition for writ of mandate because there was no recognized cause of action for misleading advice as no duty was breached, defendant state could not be sued under Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 because it was not a person for purposes of &sect; 1983, and, since defendant parole agent's actions were not part of an official state policy, no federal cause of action existed.</SPAN></P>

The petition was denied because the provision of misleading advice was not a breach of duty, defendant state could not be sued because it was not a person under statute, and no federal cause existed where defendant parole agent's acts were not the result of an official state policy.</SPAN></P>
