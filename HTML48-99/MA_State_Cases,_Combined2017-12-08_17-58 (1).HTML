</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts set forth in an order questions regarding the constitutionality of a bill entitled &quot;An act requiring a period for voluntary prayer or meditation in public schools,&quot; that would have amended Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71, &sect; 1A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order presented the questions of whether the bill would have been constitutional under Mass. Const. art. II and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court concluded that, if enacted, the bill would have violated both U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV. The effect of the statute would have been to return prayer to the public schools. Such a bill would, if enacted, come into clear conflict with the prohibitions of the establishment clause of amend. I. The court decided that the addition of the words &quot;or meditation&quot; was of no constitutional significance. Neither the fact that the opening period may sometimes result in silent meditation, nor that its observance was by a student volunteer, could have served to free it from the limitations of the establishment clause. Therefore, the court answered the question regarding the constitutionality of the bill under the federal constitution and determined that the bill would have been unconstitutional and it was unnecessary for the determination of whether the bill was constitutional under the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant school committee appealed from a judgment entered by the Superior Court Department, Essex (Massachusetts), which held that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 76, &sect; 1, required it to provide transportation to private school students under the age of 16 years to the extent that it was provided to public school students. Plaintiff Attorney General filed a cross-appeal. The court ordered direct review on its own initiative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Attorney General sought to enforce &sect; 1. The trial court held that the school committee lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of that provision and required it to provide transportation to private school students. On appeal, the court found &sect; 1 to be constitutional and affirmed the trial court's judgment. Section 1 required school committees to provide students attending private schools in fulfillment of compulsory attendance requirements the same transportation privileges as those afforded to public school students. The &quot;aid&quot; to private schools proscribed by the Massachusetts Constitution had to be more than minimal. Rather, only &quot;substantial assistance&quot; was proscribed. Because busing was a community safety measure that was not entirely dissimilar from fire or police protection and played no role in the education process, any benefit provided to the schools was remote and did not constitute substantial aid. However, a measure of reasonableness on the transportation of private school students was implicit in &sect; 1. Therefore, the school committee was only required to provide transportation to schools that were the same distance as or closer than the public school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which required the school committee to provide transportation to private school students. The matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant tenants appealed the judgments of the Boston Division of the Housing Court Department, Massachusetts, which evicted the tenants from public housing based upon violent acts committed by the tenants' sons. The tenants' cases were consolidated and heard on direct appeal. The tenants claimed to have protected property interests in their right to public housing and contended that eviction violated their constitutional rights to due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both tenants' sons were living with them when the sons firebombed other units in the housing projects. The tenants contended that eviction violated their due process rights because they were not personally responsible for the firebombings. The court held that their leases stated cause for termination in general terms, not limited to conduct of the tenants, but included household members' conduct. The court held that Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 121B, &sect; 32, required a showing of cause before the tenants could be evicted. The court held that in the case of eviction for conduct of a household member, the tenant was presumed to be aware of the problems and able to exercise some influence to avoid the problems, but could avoid eviction if special circumstances indicated that the tenant could not have foreseen the misconduct or was unable to prevent it by any means available. The court held that eviction did not violate the tenants' due process rights because the tenants' interests in remaining in low cost public housing were outweighed by the public interest in safety in public housing projects. The proper standard of proof in the evictions was a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments of the lower court evicting the tenants from public housing and granting possession to the housing authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, savings banks, savings banks association, and cooperative banks (banks), initiated an action for injunctive and declaratory relief as to their claim that the bank excise levied by defendant revenue commissioner (commissioner) pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 63, &sect; 11 was unconstitutional and also illegally applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The banks based their action for injunctive and declaratory relief upon the following claims: (1) that the excise is unreasonable and in violation of Mass. Const. Part II, ch. 1, &sect; 1, art. 4; (2) that the commissioner exceeded her authority in abiding by her long-standing interpretation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 63, &sect; 11, as forbidding the banks to deduct as an &quot;operating expense&quot; the dividends or interest paid to depositors; (3) that &sect; 11 was discriminatorily applied contrary to the state and federal constitutions; and (4) that one aspect of &sect; 11 impermissibly interfered with interstate commerce. The court determined that each of the claims was without merit and accordingly concluded that the excise was constitutional; therefore, the banks' requests for relief were denied. The court held that the income-based portion of the excise tax was reasonable because it fairly measured the present existing value of the franchises of the banks, as the value of transacting business as a savings or cooperative bank was not in any surplus that might have been accumulated, but rather in the benefits that were enjoyed by the depositors and borrowers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court directed the entry of a judgment denying injunctive relief and declaring the challenged banking statute to be constitutional as applied to the banks, and that the commissioner did not exceed her authority in construing &quot;operating expenses&quot; not to include payments made in the form of interest or dividends to depositors or holders of certificates of deposits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers sought review of an order of the Appellate Tax Board, Suffolk County (Massachusetts), which denied their request for an abatement of paid income tax. In an action against the State, they contended that the gain included within an installment payment received for an earlier sale of real estate was not taxable pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 62, &sect; 2(a) because that statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When taxpayers sold land under an installment agreement, the gain on the sale was not taxable under the state's income tax laws. However, because the taxpayers reported the sale on the installment basis for federal income tax purposes, the State assessed taxes on the amount of the gain received in a later installment payment. Their applications for abatement were denied. On appeal, the court affirmed because Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 62, &sect; 2 was constitutional, and the taxpayers were not entitled to an exemption. The statute was constitutional as it taxed only that portion of the gain that was reported, at the taxpayer's election, during the tax year in question. Hence, it was not applied retroactively. The recognition of the gain for federal tax purposes was the taxable event under the statute. There was no equal protection violation because all state taxpayers were required to use their federal adjusted gross income for state taxation purposes, and the statute was not enacted specifically to tax installment payments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the Board's determination that the taxpayers were not entitled to an abatement of state income tax paid on income received as part of an installment sale.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the taxpayers argument that the commissioner's guidelines were not reasonably calculated to achieve full and fair cash valuation and that it was error for the trial court to have declared them void. The court affirmed the judgment except by modifying the declaration of rights. The court looked to the validity of the commissioner's certification procedures. The court found that the commissioner should have included certain classes of parcels in her study, but the court found that she made a good faith effort. The court further found that the commissioner should not have relied on a study of certain property at less than full and fair cash value using a factoring process that had been declared illegal. The court noted that the taxpayers only avenue of relief lay with administrative remedies. Finally, the taxpayers were without relief under &sect; 98 for errors because such an action could not be maintained unless the tax was wholly void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been drinking at a barroom. The victim and a friend of defendant became involved in a fight outside the bar. After the fight, defendant entered the victim's van, thrusted a knife near the victim's throat, and ordered him to drive. The victim acceded to the demand until defendant told him to pull over. Before the van came to a stop, defendant stabbed him repeatedly. The judge presiding at defendant's jury trial was over 70 years of age and was sitting by virtue of the recall statute,&nbsp;Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 32, &sect; 65G. Defendant argued the unconstitutionality of the recall statute. He charged the trial judge with shifting the burden of proof in his jury instructions because the trial judge stated that, as a general rule, it was reasonable to infer that a person intended to do all the natural and probable consequences of his conduct. The court upheld the convictions. The attorney general was the proper party to test the constitutionality of the recall statute. The charge spanned 30 pages, and in at least eight instances, the trial judge stressed that the burden was on the Commonwealth to prove all elements beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff student filed suit against defendants, architect and company, for injury he sustained to his hand when a glass door to a student center designed by defendants shattered. Plaintiff's suit was filed more than 15 years after defendants designed the building and more than eight years after the enactment of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, &sect; 2B, a statute of repose that barred tort actions arising out of the design or construction of real property furnished more than six-years prior to suit. The trial court found that plaintiff's claims were barred by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, &sect; 2B and granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. Plaintiff appealed and the Massachusetts Supreme Court ordered direct review on its own initiative. In affirming the decision, the court held that Mass. Gen.

The drivers sought construction of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 20F, para. 6, inserted by 1978 Mass. Stat. ch. 478, &sect; 41.</SPAN></P>

The drivers appealed to the appeals court, and the court consolidated the cases and transferred them on its own motion. The court remanded to the district court, holding that the words &quot;normal appellate review&quot; in &sect; 20 F referred to a de novo trial in the jury-of-six session, which was the procedure applicable to misdemeanor prosecutions in general. Section 20 did not provide for a hearing if an offender elected a noncriminal disposition to the charged offense, but if the offender elected a criminal proceeding, then the preliminary hearing before the clerk-magistrate functioned as an opportunity for the offender to be heard to oppose the charges. Under &sect; 20 the offender could elect such preliminary hearing within four days of receipt of the citation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Massachusetts House of Representatives adopted an order containing a question to be submitted to the Massachusetts Supreme Court regarding the constitutionality, under Mass. Const. amend. art. 44, of provisions of H. 5528 (Mass. 1982). The bill, if enacted, would have amended Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 62, &sect; 5(a) to provide low income vanishing exemptions from state income taxation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Massachusetts House of Representatives asked the court's view of the constitutionality of changes to the state tax law pending before the legislature. The existing law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 62, &sect; 5(a), prohibited state income taxation rates that reduced annual income levels to less than $ 3,000 for individuals and $ 5,000 for married couples. H. 5528, if enacted, created so-called vanishing exemptions from state income taxation that grew smaller as income increased. The court noted that Mass. Const. amend. art. 44 required the application of state income tax at a uniform rate throughout the state upon incomes derived from the same class of property, but authorized &quot;reasonable exemptions and abatements.&quot; The court deemed the vanishing exemptions &quot;reasonable exemptions&quot; for purposes of art. 44. The monetary amounts were reasonable, as was the scheme of gradations, because it favored those least able to contribute to the cost of government and related closely to the ability to pay. Except as applied to taxpayers in the lowest ranges of the brackets whose income was near the borderline, the court held that H. 5528 complied with Mass. Const. amend. art. 44.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court responded to the question from the Massachusetts House of Representative by stating that the proposed bill, which created vanishing exemptions from state income taxation, generally were reasonable exemptions from state income tax that did not violate the requirements for tax uniformity contained in the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) when a death resulted from the statutory felony of extortion or attempted extortion, there could be no conviction unless the jury found that the extortion involved circumstances demonstrating defendant's conscious disregard of the risk to human life, as extortion could be committed in a way that was not inherently dangerous to human life; (2) there was no means of knowing whether the jury convicted defendant of felony murder or murder in the second degree based on a finding of malice aforethought; and (3) the search was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree and armed assault with intent to murder after he allegedly shot his girlfriend and another woman. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the trial court properly excluded the testimony of the victim's estranged husband that would have implicated a third person because it was otherwise inadmissible. The court rejected defendant's contention that his U.S. Const. amend. XI rights were violated because his attorney was not present at his arrest, holding that attorney's statement that defendant did not wish to speak to the police six days prior to the arrest did not insulate him from subsequent interrogation. It was a harmless error to refuse defendant an opportunity to explain a damaging statement he made during cross-examination. It was proper to admit testimony of a staff psychologist's conversation with defendant because it was not privileged under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 233 &sect; 20b because the psychologist was not psychotherapist under the statute. The jury instructions and the reading back of testimony to the jury were not prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's conviction of defendant for murder in the first degree and armed assault with intent to murder. The court held that the trial court properly excluded evidence that was hearsay and may have misled the jury, properly admitted testimony that was not privileged, properly instructed the jury, and defendant's rights were not violated because pre-arrest requests were not honored.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school refused to comply with the provisions of Mass. Gen.

The Commissioner brought action seeking to obtain compliance with the statute. The Commissioner sought summary judgment, which the trial court granted. The school appealed, but the court affirmed, holding that ch. 72, &sect; 2 was intended to facilitate the enforcement of the compulsory attendance law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 76, &sect; 1.  Mass. Gen.

Three days later, the trial judge ordered defendants to appear before him, and he revoked the suspension of defendants' sentences and ordered defendants to stand committed for the terms of their sentences. Defendants appealed and the court vacated the sentences, ordering that defendants be resentenced, and holding that while the sentences originally imposed were legally suspended, the judge acted within his authority to revoke and revise them in the interest of the public and the due administration of the law. The court found that defendants' commencement of execution of their sentences did not create a double jeopardy issue upon their resentencing, but because defendants were not given notice or an opportunity to be heard at the resentencing hearing, due process required that the sentences be vacated and an order for resentencing be issued.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, distributor and wholesaler, citing the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1 et seq., sought review of a decision of the Superior Court (Massachusetts), which entered summary judgment for defendant Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission (commission), affirming a decision of the commission ordering the distributor to cease and desist from selling alcoholic beverages not priced to correspond with Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 138, &sect;&sect; 25B, 25D.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wholesaler made purchases from the distributor at a price greater than that charged by the distiller for identical products sold directly to state wholesalers at the affirmed price. The distributor and wholesaler contended on appeal that the price differential was merely a legitimate &quot;laid-in cost&quot; and that there was thus no statutory violation and that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 138, &sect;&sect; 25B &amp; 25D were unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment. The court stated that it was the price paid by the wholesaler to the distributor that the legislature addressed in the statute and that since that price was above the affirmed price, the wholesaler violated &sect; 25B(d). The court noted that it was required for antitrust immunity that the challenged restraint must be a clearly articulated state policy, and that the policy must be actively supervised by the state itself. The court determined that the commonwealth had a strong policy with respect to the prohibition of price discrimination against its consumers, and held that the policy, as set out in &sect;&sect; 25B, 25D, was actively supervised by the commonwealth and that the statutory scheme was not preempted by 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court affirming the commission's order, which had directed the distributor to cease selling alcoholic beverages to the wholesaler at prices that violated state alcoholic beverage control statutes.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that this instruction impermissibly shifted the burden under the statute to defendant on the question of whether he was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. On appeal, the court agreed with defendant, finding that the instruction shifted to defendant the burden to prove that he had not been under the influence of liquor. The court reasoned that a jury could not be instructed that if defendant failed to introduce evidence impeaching the accuracy of the test, then they were required to find the fact that defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The court questioned the practice of using the word &quot;presumption&quot; in jury instructions, and reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

At the hearing, attorneys for both parties had a full opportunity to be heard and to file briefs and affidavits. After the hearing, the judge granted the employee's motion. On appeal, the court held that the retroactive application of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 258, &sect; 2 did not deprive the husband and the wife of a jury trial. The court rejected the argument by the husband and the wife that the retroactive application of the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act unconstitutionally deprived them of the right to recover more than $ 100,000. The husband and the wife did not show that the retroactive application of ch. 258 diminished their possible recovery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth appealed two judgments of trial courts (Massachusetts) in favor of defendant putative fathers in criminal actions under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 273, &sect; 15, as amended by 1979 Mass. Acts 621, &sect; 2, for their alleged failure to support their children. Before the court were the questions as to what were the statutes of limitations applicable to adjudications of paternity and criminal nonsupport actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both complaints alleged that defendants were the fathers of children for whom they had failed to provide reasonable support and maintenance. They were both determined to be the fathers of the children and convicted of nonsupport. On appeal for trials de novo, they claimed that the statutes of limitations had run. One case was dismissed, the other was not, and they were consolidated for review. Although Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 273 itself set out no limitation period for the bringing of actions, the Commonwealth argued that because &sect; 15 provided that the duty to support one's illegitimate children continued during minority, paternity could be adjudicated at any time during the child's minority. The court agreed that there was no limitation on the bringing of an action to adjudicate the paternity. However, under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 277, &sect; 63, a criminal nonsupport action had be brought within six years of the last alleged refusal or neglect by a defendant to provide support while obligated during the child's minority. Since a nonsupport action could therefore be brought at any time during a child's minority, and all the children here were minors, the statute of limitations had not run.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial courts' grant of defendant's motion to dismiss the first case and affirmed the denial of defendant's motion to dismiss in the second case, and both cases were remanded for trials de novo.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner adoption agency sought reversal of an order of the Bristol Division of the Probate and Family Court Department (Massachusetts), which dismissed its petition to dispense with the natural parents' consent to adoption and awarded custody to the child's father.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An adoption agency alleged that in dismissing its petition the probate court failed to apply the best interests of the child standard and made findings of fact and conclusions of law that were plainly wrong and clearly erroneous. The agency claimed that it was error to award custody because that issue was not raised in a proceeding to dispense with consent. The court held that the power to act in the child's best interest was broad enough to permit an award of custody in a proceeding under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 210, &sect; 3. The agency's petition had raised the issue of custody and the statutory scheme clearly contemplated an adjudication of the father's rights. Considered in its entirety, the record indicated that the probate court had applied the best interests standard rather than requiring a showing that the father was unfit. The findings of fact indicated that the probate court considered many factors in exercising its discretion to determine the child's best interests. It was appropriate to consider the state's policy of strengthening family life because the law recognized that a father had a substantial interest in the care, companionship, and custody of his illegitimate child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates filed an action challenging the conditions under which inmates served isolation time in a certain unit, alleging that the conditions constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. The trial court denied the inmates the declaratory and injunctive relief that they sought, and the inmates appealed. The court affirmed, finding that the trial court's findings as to the ventilation of the isolation cells were not clearly erroneous. The court would not find that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the inmates leave to amend their complaint on the eve of trial to include a fire safety issue, so the trial judge was justified in excluding the evidence as to that issue. The closing of solid doors for periods of not longer than 15 days as punishment for inmates guilty of disciplinary infractions did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment nor was it a punishment repugnant to contemporary standards of decency.</SPAN></P>

Upon examination, the officer discovered a number of invalid or altered prescriptions, and, with defendant's consent, took some of the prescriptions with him. After the officer obtained an administrative inspection warrant, he and certain agents entered the pharmacy and conducted an audit.

On appeal, the court affirmed the suppression, holding that the audit was not within the grant of authority contained in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 13, &sect; 25 and that testimony based on that audit was inadmissible against defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed a judgment of the Superior Court (Massachusetts), which denied the taxpayer attorney's fees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer sought equitable relief in her action challenging the constitutionality of certain tax collection statutes. The trial court granted partial judgment for the taxpayer, declaring the statutes unconstitutional as violative of due process and permanently enjoining the city officials from arresting, imprisoning, or threatening to arrest or imprison any delinquent motor vehicle excise taxpayer pursuant to the subject statutes. The taxpayer then amended her complaint to include the city as a defendant and to request attorney fees. Her motion to amend was unopposed and was granted. Her request for attorney fees was denied, however, and the taxpayer appealed from the part of the trial court's judgment reflecting that denial. The taxpayer argued she was the &quot;prevailing party&quot; under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988, and as such, was entitled to attorney fees. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment, remanding the matter for an assessment of attorney fees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Plymouth Superior Court (Massachusetts) for second degree murder. Defendant argued that his confession should have been suppressed, that photographic and prior misconduct evidence was erroneously admitted, and that the jury charge on malice was incorrect. Defendant also requested a discretionary order for a new trial or a reduction in the degree of guilt under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278, &sect; 33E.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the prosecution's chief witness were alone with the victim when he was killed and accused each other of murder. The court held: (1) defendant's confession was not a &quot;fruit&quot; of his legal warrantless arrest in a constitutional sense, as Miranda warnings were given twice, but was rather a direct product of an intervening circumstance in which defendant listened to the statement his accuser gave to police; (2) an interview tape proved police did not hear defendant's request to stop questioning and defendant's subsequent conduct indicated the remark was not intended as an assertion of his right to remain silent; (3) there was no evidence of incompetency to support an inference that defendant's waiver of his Miranda rights was involuntary; (4) evidence of defendant's actions the day before the murder was relevant to show intent and motive and similar to his own admissions of prior misconduct; (5) photographs were admitted with limiting instruction for the sole purpose of showing the nature of the victim's injury and the cause of his death; (6) the implied malice charge did not unconstitutionally dilute the Commonwealth's burden of proving malice beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor of Massachusetts sought the court's opinion as follows: Would enactment of Senate Bill No. 2335 constitute either an unconstitutional exercise of legislative power or an unconstitutional abrogation of the Governor's veto power as ensured by Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On December 3, 1981, the Governor was asked to approve Senate Bill No. 2335, entitled, &quot;An Act requiring legislative approval of Federal options which substantially change public benefit programs.&quot; The proposed legislation would have allowed the individual houses of the legislature to make changes to benefits programs without the use of legislation or gubernatorial approval or veto. The court opined that such legislation would be an unconstitutional abrogation of the Governor's veto power. The court so held because there was no provision for gubernatorial action following the action by the houses of the legislature. Such an act would provide an open-ended means of regulating the conduct of members of the executive branch according to the consensus of the houses of the legislature, which was constitutionally impermissible. The court declined to answer the other question presented as it was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The civil servant contended the marihuana found was the product of an unconstitutional seizure and thus could not have been used against him in proceedings to terminate his employment.

A special police officer (officer) found the jacket while making rounds and in plain view in one of the pockets was a green substance, assumed to have been marihuana. The jacket was brought to his supervisor, the substance was identified as marihuana, the jacket was returned, the canteen was kept under surveillance until the jacket was identified and returned to the civil servant. The civil servant was arrested, and a search warrant was obtained to search the vehicle in which the jacket was put. The court held the search did not violate the Fourth Amendment as the civil servant had no legitimate expectation of privacy in the canteen that was open to all hospital employees. Although the officer had never seen marijuana, the court held there was probable cause for the seizure of the marihuana as he was entitled to have used common sense in concluding the substance was marihuana.</SPAN></P>

Acts ch. 351, &sect; 2. They asserted that the limitation violated the Home Rule Amendment, Mass. Const. amend. art. 2, and should be declared a nullity.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed an action to enjoin the treasurer from implementing a specific limitation on the distribution of funds to the City of Boston, 1981 Mass. Acts ch. 351, &sect; 2, contained in the 1982 fiscal year budget. The limitation conditioned the distribution of funds on the city maintaining certain levels of police and fire protection. Plaintiffs asserted that the limitation violated the Home Rule Amendment (Amendment), Mass. Const. amend. art. 2, which prohibited the legislature from enacting laws affecting only one city or town. A single justice reserved and reported the case to the court on the pleadings and agreed facts. The court held that the limitation concerning police and fire protection in Boston violated the Amendment. The Amendment contained unequivocal words to prevent the legislature from attaching conditions to the expenditure of moneys that it appropriated. It was not enough to merely strike the conditional language. As the limitation was unconstitutional, it was severable from the rest of the fiscal budget and was struck in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, Commissioner of Revenue, appealed from a decision of the Appellate Tax Board (Massachusetts), which granted defendants, three domestic insurance companies, an abatement on an excise tax imposed by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 63, &sect; 22A. The companies challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 22A, claiming that, if the board were to read &sect; 22A literally, then the statute was unconstitutional as an improper delegation of the legislative taxing power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies argued and the board agreed that because the Massachusetts Commissioner of Insurance had authority to determine the contents of the insurers' annual statement, and because the annual statement was used to determine the amount of excise tax, &sect; 22A, in effect, gave the commissioner the discretion to determine the tax imposed. The court reversed, holding that &sect; 22A was not an improper delegation of the legislative power to tax because the legislature had great latitude of discretion in determining the standard to be adopted as the foundation of the proposed excise tax. Moreover, the court held that the legislature's choice of gross investment income as reported for regulatory purposes as a rough approximation of the value of the privilege of doing business in the commonwealth was reasonable. That the excise tax measure might include items that were not gross investment income in the tax sense, and exclude items that were gross investment income in the tax sense did not make the legislature's choice unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of murder in the first degree from the Suffolk County Superior Court (Massachusetts), alleging a plethora of issues, including the trial court's admission of defendant's admission to another of his involvement in the murder, and the two related newspaper articles. He claimed that the evidence created a serious danger that the jury's decision was based on his criminal propensity rather than on the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's primary contention was that the trial court committed reversible error when it admitted in evidence defendant's admission to another, and the two related newspaper articles. The court affirmed, holding that the statement by defendant that the one they found in New Hampshire wasn't his, was, in the context of his conversation with the other, an indivisible admission of the murders of five young women, including the victim in the present case. The admission was obviously relevant to the issue of who murdered the victim, but it also constituted evidence of defendant's participation in the murders of other women. The other's statements and defendant's reply were admissible as an admission by defendant that he killed the victim. In this case, however, the potential for unfair prejudice to the defendant was reduced by his earlier introduction of evidence implicating him in another, unconnected murder. The court held that because defendant, in his admission of the crime charged, admitted to another, unrelated crimes in a manner that rendered the admission unintelligible if references to the unrelated crimes were omitted, the entire admission was properly admitted in evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner placed a restrictive order on a parcel of the property owner's land. The restrictive order provided that the property owner could not dredge, fill, or alter the wetland. The court reversed the trial court's decision that the restrictive order was the equivalent of a taking. The court held that there was not such a deprivation of the practical uses of the property as to constitute a taking. The trial court determined that after the restrictive order the property owner could build a single family residence on the property. A single family house was a sufficient practical use to prevent the wetland restrictions from constituting a taking. Government regulations could deprive an owner of a beneficial property use without rendering the regulation an unconstitutional taking. In deciding whether a government action has effected a taking, the court had to focus on the character of the action and on the nature and extend of the interference with rights in the parcel as a whole. Because the property owner could still use his parcel for a dwelling or dwellings, there was not such an extensive interference with the parcel as a whole that it constituted a taking.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A general appropriations bill included separate line item appropriations for the two different divisions of the housing court department but did not provide for funding for its administrative office.

The state's Attorney General filed suit against defendant for a declaration that he was not occupying both of the administrative justice positions. A single justice reserved decision and forwarded two questions to the full court, whether defendant lacked the authority to hold the office due to the governor's veto of the enabling provisions, or whether defendant was precluded from occupying the position because it was occupied by another justice. The court determined that, under Mass. Const. amend. art. 63, &sect; 5, the Governor had the authority to disapprove the respective provisions and therefore defendant did not have the authority to occupy both positions.

Defendant then challenged his sentence of 40 to 50 years on the machine gun possession charge and claimed that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at sentencing and on his prior appeal. The court affirmed, holding that defendant's sentence for a violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect; 10(c) was not cruel and unusual punishment because the sentence was not disproportional and it bore a reasonable relation to permissible legislative objectives. Under the Morey test, convictions for unlawful possession of a machine gun and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon were proper because one was not a lesser included offense of the other, so defendant was not subjected to double jeopardy. Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel because he did not make any showing of prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, &sect; 26 provided an absolute hiring preference for commonwealth residents for certain state-funded construction projects. An executive order by the mayor of Boston required that 50 percent of such jobs be filled by municipal residents. The court found in favor of the unions and the employers and against the government because limiting work opportunities infringed on a fundamental right without valid justification in violation of the Privileges and Immunities Clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2, cl. 1. Thus, the commonwealth could not use its control over a resource to statutorily force an absolute preference in hiring by a private contractor. The court struck down the mayoral executive order because a strict numerical hiring requirement was not targeted at legitimate interests of decreasing unemployment, and the order had an unconstitutional negative impact on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prevailing litigants, single parents, prevailed in their action attacking the constitutionality of a blanket prohibition against recording both parents' names on birth certificates of illegitimate children. State and local government officials contended that the litigants' motion for attorneys' fees had not been timely filed with the trial court. The court held that the request for attorneys' fees was timely because under Mass. R. Civ. P. 54(a) or its federal counterpart, the judgment of the trial court anticipated further litigation on the fees issue and thus was not &quot;final&quot; in character so as to render the motion for fees untimely. The court ruled that the litigants were &quot;prevailing parties&quot; for purposes of being entitled to fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 even though the case ended in what was essentially a consent judgment and notwithstanding the fact that the relief achieved by the parents was granted on statutory, not constitutional grounds. The court considered the 12-factors enunciated in the Johnson decision, including the modest nature of the result achieved and the lack of pressure experienced by litigants' attorneys, and awarded fees in the amount of $ 2,600.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court Department (Massachusetts) of larceny over $ 100, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &sect; 30, and uttering a forged check, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 267, &sect; 5, and was adjudged and sentenced as a &quot;common and notorious thief&quot; under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &sect; 40. He appealed, arguing that &sect; 40 was unconstitutional, conviction for both larceny and uttering was duplicitous, and he was denied effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 40 was unconstitutional in its failure to require notice to defendant that he might be sentenced under its provisions. The court noted that defendant could be sentenced under &sect; 40 without notice of the possibility appearing in the indictments. The court held that defendant's U.S. Const. amend. VI right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, his comparable right under Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 12, and his right to be heard on the issue whether three distinct larcenies were proved were not violated by the failure to inform him prior to trial of the possible application of the sentencing procedure of &sect; 40. The court held that defendant's convictions for both uttering and larceny were not duplicitous and did not subject him to multiple punishments for the same offense in contravention of the double jeopardy clause or any rule of common law. Neither offense was a lesser-included offense of the other. Each offense required proof of a fact that the other did not. Having read the entire record, the court concluded that defendant was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed. The statute violated neither the federal nor the state constitution. Larceny and uttering were separate crimes and conviction for both was not duplicitous. Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposition limited state and local taxation and expenditures.

The objectors also argued that special treatment given to municipalities whose fiscal year assessments were less than two and one-half percent violated a localities exclusion and that a summary prepared by the attorney general was not fair and concise because it omitted certain matters and contained a misstatement of the substance of one portion of the proposition. The court considered the challenges argued by the objectors and found no error in the appellate review of the proposition. The court found that it was appropriate that judgment was entered in the lower court declaring that the proposition was lawfully adopted through the initiative process of the constitution and that the renter's deduction provided for in Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury verdict in the trial court (Massachusetts) convicted defendant of conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance, he appealed and the court ordered direct review on its own initiative. Defendant challenged the issuance of an &quot;anticipatory&quot; search warrant pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, &sect; 1. There were four coconspirators: a Massachusetts resident and three California residents. A coconspirator mailed drugs to Massachusetts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The post office tipped off the police, who seized the package and obtained a warrant to be executed after delivery of the package. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress. The court affirmed. Neither logic nor the policies underlying the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement supported a general prohibition against the use of anticipatory warrants. The essential question under &sect; 1, as under the Fourth Amendment, was whether the evidence stated in the affidavit created substantial probability that seizable property would be on the premises when searched. Section 1 permitted search warrants to issue on a showing that concealment or possession was probable at the time a warrant was to be executed, not solely at the time of its issuance. Upon establishing a proper foundation, the statement of one coconspirator made during the course of the conspiracy and in furtherance of it was admissible against other conspirators, despite their absence at the time of the statement. The facts permitted an inference that defendant lived with the Massachusetts resident. An inference need only have been reasonable and possible; it need not have been necessary or inescapable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee owned a lounge where he had been licensed to provide live entertainment, including exotic dancing. When he later sought to renew his license, he was denied by the town licensing board and instituted action. Owner then sought a temporary restraining order from the probate court, on the ground that a revocation of his license would cause him immediate and irreparable monetary injury, loss, and hardship. The probate court judge, in two actions, temporarily restrained the licensing board from revoking his entertainment license until there was a judicial determination on the matter. The court stated that in deciding whether the probate court properly exercised jurisdiction over the subject matter of this case, it had to determine whether the matter fell within the general grant of jurisdiction given to the probate courts under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 215, &sect; 6. The court concluded that the probate court lacked jurisdiction because it was a court of limited jurisdiction and review of an action of an administrative board in suspending or revoking a license, was not a matter cognizable under the general principles of equity jurisprudence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the probate court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 278, &sect; 28E, and the rule of court, Mass. R. Crim. P. 15(b)(2). The court held that the commonwealth in an appropriate case could seek relief from the single justice's ruling by a petition under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 211, &sect; 3, addressed to the full court. The court held that the commonwealth was not entitled to relief under &sect; 3 in the case because the single justice did not abuse his discretion in concluding that the administration of justice would not be facilitated by further interlocutory rulings in the case. The court found that the provisions of the search warrant were not crafted with the precision needed to protect against its extraordinary execution by overzealous officers and the single justice might properly have discerned a gross abuse of the power conferred upon government agents by a search warrant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the trial of defendant accused of forcibly raping minors, the trial court closed the court to the public and press. The court denied the newspaper an order permitting members of the press to attend the trial, determining that the case was moot and that Mass. Gen.

The United States Supreme Court remanded the case in light of a decision that recognized that U.S. Const. amend. I guaranteed a right of public access to criminal trials. On remand, the court dismissed the newspaper's appeal, determining that ch. 278, &sect; 16A was constitutional under U.S. Const. amend. I. Chapter 278, &sect; 16A limited immediate public observance of testimony of minors who were victims of sexual assault in order to encourage minor victims to come forward, to protect minor victims from public humiliation, to enhance the likelihood of credible testimony from minors, to promote the sound and orderly administration of justice, and to preserve evidence and obtain convictions.

The court reversed the conviction. The court held that the flare gun was not a firearm because it was not a weapon by design. It had a legitimate, noncombative function. It did not matter that the defendant alluded to keeping it as a weapon. The state weapons licensing scheme required that the item be characterized as a weapon in advance of acquisition. Also, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect; 129C(a) exempts flare gun owners from having to obtain a firearm identification card. Also, the court hesitated to conclude that it could discharge a shot or bullet within the meaning of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 141, &sect; 121 &amp; ch. 269, &sect; 10(c).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The oil company sought a declaration that the operation of its self-service gasoline station was not hazardous or injurious to the public, and that the ordinance was invalid under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and under Mass.

The action was referred to a master, who found self-service stations to be generally as safe as conventional stations and safer than conventional stations as regards the incidence of fire. The master also found that the ban unjustly discriminated against self-service stations. The superior court adopted the master's decision but determined that the ordinance bore a reasonable relation to permissible objects of legislation. On appeal, the court affirmed the superior court's decision because the oil company had an onerous burden that was not met. The legislation did bear a reasonable relation to protection of public health or safety. The court found that the evidence presented to the city legislative body was at least arguable and that the legislation was not subject to constitutional attack.</SPAN></P>

The letter was returned, and the department, therefore, published notification of petition to dispense with the parental consent for the adoption. The mother alleged that, under Mass.  Gen. Law ch. 210, &sect; 3, the trial court erred in granting the petition because there was not showing that she was unfit, and because the department failed to the commonwealth's statutorily declared policy of strengthening families. The court reversed the decision because the trial court failed to make the expressly required finding that the mother was currently unfit.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners in consolidated cases sought review of a decision by the Superior Court, Middlesex County (Massachusetts) which denied the property owners' motion to have a lis pendens discharged on the grounds that the ex parte procedure of the Massachusetts lis pendens statute,&nbsp;Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 184, &sect; 15, violated the due process rights of the property owners under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners had unsuccessfully attempted to have a lis pendens discharged on the grounds that the ex parte procedure of the Massachusetts lis pendens statute,&nbsp;Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 184, &sect; 15, violated their due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision that held that the statute was constitutional, because a memorandum of lis pendens did not result in seizure of property or dispossession of the owner or prohibit the owner from alienating or encumbering the property, but instead merely protected potential transferees by informing them about pending litigation involving the property. The court noted that this information was something that conscientious sellers would provide even without the statute and held that considering the state's minimal involvement and the simple notice function of the lis pendens procedure, the process provided in the underlying litigation on the property dispute was sufficient, and therefore Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 184, &sect; 15 did not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the holding that the lis pendens statute was constitutional because the owner was being deprived of no more than the ability to alienate property without informing the prospective transferee of the existence of litigation involving the property, which was not a deprivation worthy of due process protection beyond that inhering in the underlying litigation itself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city ordinance being contested by the condominium owners prevented them from occupying rental units that they owned if the units had been subject to rent control and if the last previous occupant was a tenant. The idea was to prevent rent control units that were converted into condominiums from being used for purposes other than rental housing. The condominium owners argued that the city did not have the power to enact such an ordinance and that the ordinance was effected an unconstitutional taking. The court affirmed the trial court decision in favor of the defendants and found that the ordinance was properly enacted pursuant to 1976 Mass. Acts ch. 36, which granted the city the right to control rents and eviction. Although ch. 36 did not expressly grant the right to bar the condominium owners from occupying their property, the right to regulate the removal of rental housing from the market was incidental to the power to regulate rents. The court also found that the ordinance did not effect a taking because the ordinance only denied the condominium owners the right to exploit one of many property interests and still guaranteed them a return on their investment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trust filed a claim for an abatement of income taxes assessed on its rental income. The Board rejected the claim. The trust argued that the assessment of an income tax on its net rental income was unconstitutional because the Commonwealth could not impose both a local real estate tax on the value of the trust's real estate and an income tax on the trust's rental income. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision and held that the Commonwealth's authority to impose an income tax was set forth in Mass. Const. amend. art. 44. The court ruled that article 44 granted complete authority to tax the full range of incomes. The court held that there was no merit to the trust's claim that it was unfairly discriminatory and a denial of equal protection to impose an income tax on net rental income from property that was also subject to a local property tax. The court ruled that there was a rational basis for the legislature to subject real estate to local taxation and not to subject certain other income-producing property to local taxation. The court held that any distinction in a tax statute that had a rational basis would survive a challenge under the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 229, and appointed special counsel to prosecute, on behalf of the son, the related wrongful death action, which was brought by the co-administrators against certain tortfeasors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent was killed in a car accident. After the co-administrators, administrators of decedent's estate, brought a wrongful death action against the tortfeasors responsible for the decedent's death, the son brought the present action to establish his right to recovery from the wrongful death action. At the outset, the court noted that, on appeal, the administrators did not challenge the son's status as next-of-kin. Moreover, the court noted that its own prior decision had eliminated the former statutory distinction between an illegitimate child's right to inherit from his mother and from his father. The court also ruled that the trial court properly appointed counsel to prosecute the wrongful death action. In reaching this conclusion, the court noted that, as the next-of-kin, the son was entitled to the recovery from the wrongful death action. Moreover, while the trial court did not have the authority to substitute the son for the co-administrators in the tort action, the trial court correctly determined that counsel for the real-party-in-interest, the son, should have been in control of the proceeding. As such, the trial court acted within his authority under ch. 229, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order determining that the son was the next of kin of the decedent, and appointing special counsel to prosecute the companion tort action.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect; 32 in the Suffolk Superior Court (Massachusetts). Defendant contended that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 233, &sect; 21, which allowed a defendant to be impeached by prior convictions, was unconstitutional, and that the two convictions violated his double jeopardy rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of unlawful distribution of a controlled substance and of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect; 32. Police officers witnessed defendant remove a brown bag from a trash can and transfer it to another individual. The police officers searched the trash can and discovered additional brown bags. The brown bags contained heroin.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 233, &sect; 21 entitled the prosecutor to introduce the defendant's prior convictions if he chose to testify, and defendant contended that such statute violated his constitutional right to testify. The court affirmed defendant's convictions, finding that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 233, &sect; 21 was not unconstitutional because it provided for limiting instructions and gave the trial judge discretion to exclude such evidence if its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. The court also concluded that defendant's double jeopardy rights were not violated because separate items were involved in the respective charges: defendant had completed one heroin sale, and was holding a separate cache of the drug for future distributions.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 123A, &sect; 9, a Massachusetts superior court reported to the court of appeals its order providing for the implementation of a conditional or gradual release program for petitioner inmate from the treatment center for sexually dangerous persons, but the court, upon its own motion, transferred the case to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was confined to a treatment center for sexually dangerous persons at a correctional institution. Upon his petition, the trial court, pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123A, &sect; 9, entered an order providing for the implementation of a conditional or gradual release program for the inmate. The trial court reported to the court of appeals the questions of law raised by the Commonwealth's objections to the order, and upon the court's own motion, the case was transferred to the court. The court vacated the order and remanded the case to the trial court for the purpose of making the required finding of whether the inmate was sexually dangerous. The trial court had no authority to order any form of release from the treatment center without first finding that the inmate was no longer a sexually dangerous person. The placing of conditions on the release of a person found to be no longer sexually dangerous was unconstitutional, and the trial court's order clearly contemplated a conditional release of the inmate because it was designated as a gradual release program and placed restrictions, including escorts, on the inmate's &quot;absences&quot; from the treatment center.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff individuals sought review of a decision from the Superior Court Department (Massachusetts), which declared certain legislation constitutional. The individuals had challenged the lawfulness of legislation authorizing the city to conduct a vote at its election on the question whether the city's water supply should continue to be fluoridated. The court, on its own initiative, ordered direct appellate review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individuals argued that the Home Rule Amendment invalidated the special authorization. The action was commenced, seeking a declaration that the special legislation was unconstitutional and also seeking an injunction against placing the fluoridation question on the ballot. The individuals' principal argument was that the legislation authorizing the city to conduct a plebiscite on the issue of fluoridation was barred by the Home Rule Amendment. The court held that there was no valid basis for this contention, nor any support for the individuals' other constitutional challenges to the special legislation. The special legislation simply gave the city's voters another chance to vote against fluoridating the public water supply. The effect of this limited legislation hardly constituted the unfair granting of an individual benefit or the denying to an individual of rights generally available to others, and thus did not present any serious question of special legislation. The court held that the special acts were not shown to do injury to the constitutionally protected interest of any individual.</SPAN></P>

The court, on its own motion, transferred the report to itself. The trial court posed a number of questions concerning the constitutionality, validity, and applicability of statutes, ordinances, and regulations related to charges brought by the commonwealth against defendant businesses for operating jukeboxes and soft drink vending machines without licenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with offering entertainment by means of a juke box, recorded music, and dancing for a fee on Sunday without a license as required by Mass.

Laws ch. 140, &sect;&sect; 21A-21C; keeping a table for playing pool for a fee without a license as required by Mass.  Gen. Law ch. 140, &sect; 178; and operating a juke box, recorded music, and dancing for a fee on a weekday without a license as required by City Code of Boston. The court held that this was an appropriate situation for an interlocutory report as many cases awaited trial for the same circumstances alleged against defendants. Each of the laws was constitutional. The fact that the pool tables were coin operated did not remove them from the purview of the statute because the addition of a statute specifically addressing licensing of automatic amusement devices did not impliedly repeal Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect; 177. Neither the jukebox nor the soft drink licensing laws offended the First Amendment because they did not concern protected activities.</SPAN></P>

The plaintiffs sought to enjoin enforcement of statutory provisions including Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 29, &sect; 20B which restricted funding of abortions under the state Medicaid program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individuals challenged the restriction of Medicaid funding for abortions to cases in which the procedure was necessary to prevent a woman's death. The court noted that Roe v. Wade forbade states to interpose material obstacles to the effectuation of a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy during the first trimester. The court held that although the state retained a wide latitude to decide the manner in which it allocated benefits, it could not use criteria that discriminatorily burdened the exercise of a fundamental right. Therefore the court found that by injecting coercive financial incentives favoring childbirth, the statutory restriction deprived indigent woman of freedom to choose abortion over maternity. The court also determined that the state's interest in preservation of life was outweighed by the interest of pregnant woman in choosing a medically necessary abortion. Therefore the court held that the challenged restriction was invalid in so far as it prohibited the use of state Medicaid funds to reimburse authorized providers for lawful, medically necessary abortion services rendered to qualified Medicaid recipients.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth brought an action for an injunction requiring the school committee to comply with the special education requirements of chapter 766.

After a trial judge entered an order granting the injunction sought by the commonwealth, the parties presented the issue to the full court for review. The court held that the school committee did not meet its burden of proving that the payment of public funds under contracts for services with private schools, as provided under chapter 766, were for the purpose of founding, maintaining, or aiding private institutions in violation of Mass. Const. art. 46, &sect; 2. The court noted that privatization of special education was required under chapter 766 only after it was first determined that a public school lacked the ability or desire to meet the needs of special education students and that this requirement was intended to benefit children, not to aid or promote private schools.</SPAN></P>

The lower court entered judgment for the separated wife, and the tenant appealed. After granting the request for direct appellate review in the first case and ordering direct appellate review in the second case on its own initiative, the court held that: 1) the separated husband's alleged tearing up of the unrecorded deed, in which the wife transferred property back to spouses as tenants by the entirety and which was delivered though being placed and remaining in possession of the attorney, would not result in the revival of the prior recorded deed in which the spouses transferred the property to the wife as an individual; and 2) the separated wife's 14-day notice to quit for nonpayment of rent was adequate at the time to immediately terminate a gratuitous tenancy, and the tenant became a tenant at sufferance and would be liable for a reasonable rent if the wife had the capacity to act as landlord.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried before a jury and was convicted on charges of rape and commission of an unnatural and lascivious act. Defendant appealed his convictions pursuant to Mass. Gen.

Defendant contended that the purpose of introducing evidence of the claimant's prior arrest for prostitution was not to show that she was or had been a prostitute, and that it was therefore more likely that she had solicited or consented to have sex with defendant. Rather, defendant argued that it was to show that, having been found in a similar situation on two prior occasions, the complainant was herself arrested and charged with a crime. Thus, the allegation of rape against defendant may have been motivated by her desire to avoid further prosecution. The court reversed defendant's convictions and remanded the case for a new trial. The court held that the rape-shield statute,&nbsp;Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 233, &sect; 21B, could not be construed so broadly as to render inadmissible evidence that was relevant to show the complainant's bias.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his second degree murder conviction, contending several errors were committed at trial. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, concluding that neither the specific assignments of error nor the court's independent review revealed any errors that required reversal or the entry of a verdict for a lesser degree of guilt. The court explained that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting the scope of cross-examination because defendant was allowed to establish that a witness had his memory refreshed with regard to testimony about how defendant was holding the knife. The court further found that a spa glove was properly admitted because articles discovered at or near the crime scene were admissible where they tended to shed light on the setting in which the crime occurred. The court concluded that although the trial judge did err by instructing the jury about a presumption of malice arising from the intentional use of a deadly weapon, the charge, when scrutinized as a whole, could not have reasonably been interpreted to relieve the state of any part of its burden to prove the requisite malice to support a homicide.</SPAN></P>

The court held that that the &quot;lewd, wanton and lascivious persons&quot; provision of the statute, unless aided by appropriate judicial construction, was unconstitutionally vague. The court established a construction of the statute in this opinion to the effect that the statute prohibits the commission of conduct in a public place, or the public solicitation of conduct to be performed in a public place, when the conduct committed or solicited involves the touching of the genitals, buttocks, or female breasts, for purposes of sexual arousal, gratification, or offense, by a person who knows or should know of the presence of a person or persons who may be offended by the conduct.

The appellate court found that the commonwealth had failed to rebut defendant's prima facie case that a sufficiently large and distinct group of young people were substantially underrepresented in the venire from which both the grand and petit jury pools were drawn. The appellate court reversed defendant's conviction and dismissed the indictment. On appeal by the commonwealth, the court found that younger people were not underrepresented in the venire. However, the court determined that it was necessary to reverse defendant's conviction because the trial court erred in charging the jury based upon the theory of wanton and reckless conduct in leaving the victim on the ground outside the bar. The court further found that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury on the issue of self-defense. The court explained that if defendant used all proper means to avoid physical combat, he could have used appropriate and non-deadly force to protect himself, even from a drunk susceptible to injury, if he reasonably believed that his personal safety or life was in peril.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Initially, the court determined that under the circumstances, it could entertain the declaratory relief action pending the resolution of defendants' criminal trials because of the importance of the constitutional question involved.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a petition for a writ of error challenging the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County (Massachusetts) convicting him of murder in the first degree. The court had affirmed that conviction on direct appeal. Defendant now advanced arguments that were not raised in that appeal, although each of them might have been.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the prosecutor improperly used peremptory challenges to exclude all but one black person from the jury, and that the jury selection procedures as handed down in a state supreme court case should be applied retroactively so as to invalidate his conviction. The court, however, held that the jury selection principals outlined in the case cited by defendant should not be applied retroactively, at least in a case, such as the one at bar, where race was not a factor in the trial. The court noted that whatever impropriety might have been involved in the prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges, there was no showing that the jurors who were actually chosen were incapable of reaching an impartial verdict. The rule announced in the case cited was not clearly foreshadowed by prior case law. Moreover, the retroactive application of the rule would adversely affect the administration of justice in that the defendant's conviction had already been subject to review on appeal. As to defendant's challenge on the jury instructions, the court held that the trial court clearly placed the burden of disproving self-defense and provocation on the Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in a bench trial at the district court of using a motor vehicle without authority and receiving stolen goods. He appealed for a trial de novo before a jury of 12 in the superior court as provided under the two-tier system set forth in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278, &sect; 18 (as amended by 1974 Mass. Acts 167). At the superior court he filed a motion to dismiss the charges and argued that there was insufficient admissible evidence to convict him at the district court bench trial. He also argued that a trial de novo in the superior court would violate his double jeopardy rights. The superior court found that it had no jurisdiction to hear the double jeopardy claim and denied the motion. Defendant then filed a petition seeking relief with the court under its general superintendence powers. The court dismissed the petition and held that the superior court was the appropriate forum for defendant's double jeopardy challenge. However, the court found that defendant's claim was not valid because the two-tier system had already withstood constitutional challenges on double jeopardy grounds in the United States Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

The town sought a revised judgment, which was granted but further relief from the revision was denied. The court determined that the case should have been treated as a civil contempt case. The court affirmed the lower court's order because the town failed to achieve substantial compliance with the order. The court reasoned that the town was a corporate body so it was not necessary to show willful disobedience or intention to violate the order, but the lower court erred in ordering the fine to be expended at the attorney general's direction and the case was remanded for further proceedings. The court held that punitive damages could not be imposed on a contemnor in a civil proceeding and that the fine was not appropriate because there was no indication as to the extent to which anyone was harmed.</SPAN></P>

The landlord declined to post such a bond. Instead, the landlord brought suit to have the statute declared unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The appellate court granted the landlord judgment on the pleadings, and the district court appealed. The court held that the statute was constitutional because it was within the power of the state to regulate the special relationship between a landlord and tenant. The court also found that because the treble damages provision of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, &sect; 15B was constitutional, the requirement to post bond in that amount was also constitutional.

Although the court found that the state had a compelling interest for the classification in order to prevent fraud where a child's paternity had not been declared or adjudicated, it held that the statute was overly broad and that it would not have passed constitutional muster.

The judge failed to give the jury a definition of &quot;malice&quot; as it related to arson as a necessary element. The prosecutor's comment in closing argument regarding defendant's failure to call a witness was permissible because the verdict and sentencing were complete in the witness's case, and therefore there was no impediment to calling the witness. The judge's refusal to allow evidence under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 233, &sect; 21, of witnesses' prior crimes was error because they had not yet been sentenced.</SPAN></P>

They discovered a bag containing drugs in the attic. Police obtained a warrant for defendant's arrest. When defendant was arrested he had 20 packets of amphetamines on his person. The district court acquitted defendant of the charges arising from the search of his apartment. The superior court convicted him of unauthorized possession of amphetamines with intent to distribute based on the drugs found when he was arrested. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the application of collateral estoppel was not constitutionally required because defendant was not twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense and because the suppression ruling of the district court judge could not be appealed and was not supported by a record. There were two separate offenses that did not involve the same time, place or drugs. Therefore, no double jeopardy concerns were implicated. The search of the attic was appropriate and once in the attic the police had the authority to seize the bag of drugs in plain view. Defendant's intent to distribute could be inferred from the quantity of drugs on him when he was arrested.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Land Court (Massachusetts) found Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 187, &sect; 5 (the statute) was a retrospective statute, and was constitutional, and declared that the statute entitled appellee property owner to install utilities in the right of way bordering his property. Appellant foundation, which owned the private right of way, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner owned property bordering a private right of way owned by the foundation. By deed, the property owner enjoys an easement across the way for ingress and egress only. The statute provided that property owners abutting a private way who had &quot;existing&quot; rights of ingress and egress &quot;shall have&quot; the right to install utility service along such way. The trial court found the statute was to be applied retroactively and, on appeal, the court reviewed the plain language of the statute and agreed. The court found that retroactive application was intended and that such application gave the property owner the right to install utility service along the foundation's right of way. Further, the court found the statute was constitutional as applied because the legislature may have deemed the installation of utilities necessary and, aside from that concern, the property owner already enjoyed, prior to the enactment of the statute, an extensive ability to &quot;invade&quot; the foundation's land. Thus, it was clear that allowing the additional use under the statute did not amount to a taking.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court ruling because prospective application was clearly intended by the legislature and such application was constitutional when keeping in mind the need that property owners had for access to necessary utilities.</SPAN></P>

A justice of the appeals court vacated the preliminary injunction and issued an order to restrain defendants from paying the increased compensation, upon the motion of the chief justice pursuant to 1977 Mass. Acts 278. After a trial, the trial court entered judgment that the city council order was null and void and that ch. 278 was constitutional, as applied to the court officers. On appeal, the court officers' principal argument was that the city council order was not inconsistent with ch. 278. The court affirmed the judgment.

A customer was hit and killed by defendant's actions. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that defendant's limited education and intellectual ability did not preclude an effective waiver of his rights. The court reasoned that defendant had had years of worldly experience, including several encounters with the law in which he had four or five times been given Miranda warnings. The court then found that the facts supported that defendant's waiver was knowing and his statement voluntary. The court also found that it was not error to prohibit defendant from cross-examining the store clerk about his prior criminal history where the history fell short of a conviction as was required for impeachment under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 233, &sect; 21.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff newspaper sought review of the judgment of a single justice session of the court which denied a temporary restraining order and a permanent injunction ordering defendant Superior Court to permit the press to attend a criminal trial and related proceedings which the trial court closed to the general public pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278, &sect; 16A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ordered a trial involving rape of underage complainants to be closed under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278, &sect; 16A. The newspaper sought an injunction to allow it access to the courtroom to cover the trial. The single justice session of the court denied the injunction, and the newspaper appealed. On review, the court dismissed the appeal as moot, but considered some of the issues raised by the newspaper because they were capable of repetition yet evading review. The court held that &sect; 16A was mandatory only as to the victim' s testimony because the word &quot;trial&quot; as used in the statute was ambiguous and the statute should have been strictly construed in favor of publicity as it was in deprecation of the common law. The court declined to hold that the press had a &quot;direct interest&quot; under &sect; 16A because a policy of admitting the press would have increased the risk of loss of young victims' testimony. Finally, the court set forth guidelines for closures of other parts of trials under &sect; 16A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered the appeal to be dismissed as moot. The court held that the case could be decided on nonconstitutional grounds, construed the statute to relate to closure of the trial only during the victim's testimony, held that the word &quot;shall&quot; was mandatory as to the victim's testimony, and set forth guidelines relating to the closure of other parts of trials under the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for rape of a child under 16 years of age on the grounds that he was denied his right to a public trial, under the Sixth Amendment. Defendant conceded that his rights were not unconstitutionally infringed by closing the trial to the public during the 13 year old victims' testimony. The Commonwealth conceded that defendant had a constitutional right to have the balance of the trial open to the public. The record did not show whether the public was excluded from the entire trial. Out of the jury's presence and before the presentation of any evidence, the Commonwealth requested a closed hearing. Defendant's attorney only stated that defendant was entitled to an open hearing, but did not state his reasons. The trial court decided to close the hearing. On appeal, the court found that defendant did not demonstrate that his trial was impermissibly closed. The court remanded the case for a determination of the extend to which the trial was closed to the public and whether defendant properly waived his right to a public trial. The court noted that defendant was not required to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the closing of the balance of his trial.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment of the trial court that dismissed the petition and ordered a new judgment to have been entered for the discharge of the inmate from any further service of his first sentence. The court held that the principles of fairness required extending good time credits for the entire period of the inmate's improper confinement. The court also determined that the inmate could have been convicted of the crime of escape even though he was improperly serving a sentence at the time of his escape but that in the special circumstances of the inmate's case the good time credits should not have been forfeited.</SPAN></P>

The trial court fashioned progressively more invasive injunctive remedies to attempt to guide and compel defendant to secure plaintiffs' minimal statutory rights to decent, safe and sanitary housing. After a number of injunctions, the appointment of a &quot;master&quot; to direct and monitor remediation, and a consent decree, the trial court ordered appointment of a receiver to temporarily assume the functions of defendant's board to lead defendant into compliance with the sanitary code. The court affirmed because the use of a &quot;neo-receiver&quot; to effectively replace defendant's board was a reasonable measure of last resort and was within the powers of the trial court under &sect;127H, which invoked general equity powers on the part of the trial court to call to its assistance any agents or officers whose services appeared to be reasonably necessary to attain a legitimate objective, and because neither the principle of separation of powers nor a statutory provision regarding removal of board members for cause was violated.</SPAN></P>

The court directed that, on remand, the district attorney was to take whatever steps were appropriate to secure the minutes in question and that if he failed to do so, or if the federal court refused to release the transcripts for security reasons, the indictment was to be dismissed with prejudice. The court also directed that any federal restrictions were to be honored, but that if the minutes might create a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist, a new trial could be appropriate, while the verdict would stand if they did not. On other assignments of error, the court found that an amendment to the indictment did not prejudice defendant, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in its restrictions on cross-examination and its correction of improper closing argument.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the theory of guilt of rape through female-to-female intercourse was properly considered by the jury because defendants were put on notice that the female-to-female encounters were a phase of the case the prosecution proposed to prove and the bill of particulars clarified any ambiguity regarding the charge. The court held further that the jury instruction regarding joint venture was proper because the charge emphasized the requirements of active participation in a common design, and the judge made it clear that to convict the jury was required to find that defendants actively participated, aided and abetted. In addition, the court held that the victim witness' testimony was not a story inherently impossible or so fantastic that no rational person could reasonably believe it -- which would show intrinsically a lack of sufficient knowledge. Further, the court held that the prosecution's use of prior convictions to impeach was authorized by Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 233, &sect; 21, and the right for a limiting instruction was forfeited by the omission to ask for it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder in the second degree after a trial by jury in 1970. The judge imposed the statutory sentence of life imprisonment. At trial, defendant admitted killing the victim, but claimed that he had acted in self-defense. Defendant appealed the sentence assigning alleged errors during the trial and in the denial of the 1977 motion for a new trial. The principal questions presented for the court's consideration were the following: (1) whether defendant's difficulty communicating with his non-Spanish speaking trial attorney deprived him of his right to effective assistance of counsel or his right of confrontation, (2) whether the judge erred in admitting defendant's admissions and confession in evidence, and (3) whether the judge erred in instructing the jury on reasonable doubt and on the burden of proof of voluntariness of defendant's statements. The court held that although there were constitutional errors present in this case, they were harmless and that the evidence in the record supported the conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant cemetery petitioned for direct appellate review and challenged an order of the Superior Court (Massachusetts) that declared Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 112, &sect; 87 constitutional. The cemetery had filed a declaratory judgment action alleging that the statute's restriction that a corporation may engage in the funeral directing business only if it engaged in no other business was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and the state constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cemetery argued that the statute governing funeral directing served only the goals of preventing disease and ensuring that funeral directors and embalmers possessed the technical skills and that the other business prohibition of the statute bore no rational relationship to either objective. The cemetery argued that the statute had a legislative classification that was not rationally related to either objective. On appeal, the court affirmed the finding that the statute was unconstitutional. The right to engage in a particular occupation was not a fundamental right and if the legislative act could be supported on any rational basis, the court had no basis to strike it down as violative of constitutional rights. The statute was a valid exercise of the legislature's police power to protect the public welfare. The statute was part of a comprehensive statutory scheme that regulated the funeral industry. The legislature was free to pursue the general goal of enhancing the quality of funeral services, which was in the public interest. The statute was not subject it to a less restrictive means analysis and the classification was rationally related to a legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a trial by jury, defendant was found guilty of disseminating an adult magazine, knowing it to be obscene, in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 29. The Superior Court of Middlesex County (Massachusetts) had denied defendant's motion for a directed verdict. Defendant appealed the superior court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The central issue on appeal was whether defendant was properly convicted of knowingly disseminating obscene matter in violation of &sect; 29. Defendant claimed that the Commonwealth failed to produce sufficient evidence to allow the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew the magazine to be obscene at the time he sold it. The Commonwealth contended that the fact that defendant was the active owner and manager of the store supported an inference that he had actual knowledge of the magazine's contents, and therefore knowingly disseminated obscene material. The court found no evidence that defendant had actual knowledge of the contents of the adult magazine at issue. A detective testified that defendant did not examine the magazine. In addition, in response to the prosecutor's obvious attempt to elicit any other indication that defendant might have been familiar with the contents of the magazine by asking if, at the time of sale, defendant &quot;did anything,&quot; the detective replied that he did not. Furthermore, the Commonwealth's evidence of defendant's long association with the store by itself failed to show any corresponding familiarity with the adult magazine at issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The basic purpose of the regulation was to require persons who offered a food product for sale in package form to disclose a date on the package to provide the consumer with information about the quality of the product as it could have been adversely affected by the passage of time. Disclosure of this type was generally known as open date labeling. The vendor, or potential vendor, had to disclose either of two dates. Plaintiffs argued that defendants lacked statutory authority to adopt any regulation requiring open date labeling. After a hearing, the court granted judgment declaring that defendants were authorized to adopt the regulation and had done so in conformity with the requirements of law. The court's judgment further declared that plaintiffs had not demonstrated the unconstitutionality of the regulation. The court held that all rational presumptions were to be made in favor of the validity of the regulation. The court further held that a regulation could have been authorized even where it could not have been traced to specific statutory language. The court found that the 18-month delay of the hearing was not excessive in light of the complexity of the regulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered direct appellate review from the Superior Court (Massachusetts), which upheld a decision of the conservation commission of defendant town, under the Commonwealth's Wetlands Protection Act, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 131, &sect; 40, and the town's parallel by-law, denying plaintiff land owners' application to construct a road over adjoining marshlands in order to facilitate service to a proposed subdivision on their land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court did not view the town's by-law to be a zoning enactment because it manifested neither the purpose nor the effects of a zoning regulation. Its dominant purpose was to protect wetlands values, not including air pollution, noise, demands for sewers and other municipal services or the character of the community and the compatibility of nearby land uses, all typical of the concerns of the zoning process. Likewise, the court detected no inconsistency between the by-law and the Commonwealth's Wetlands Protection Act, since the language of the by-law paralleled that of the statute and furthered -- rather than derogated from -- the legislative purpose embodied in the Wetlands Protection Act. Persons aggrieved by a commission decision under the by-law had the same remedy as was available under any other nonzoning by-law -- an action in the nature of certiorari under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 249, &sect; 4. The court found no evidence of bias by the commissioners and the commission's conclusion was fully supported by &quot;substantial evidence&quot; in the record. Further, no unconstitutional taking occurred because land owners had viable alternatives, such as selling the land for a profit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the order of the commission was correct. Accordingly, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A psychiatric social worker employed at a hospital petitioned the juvenile court for a determination that the mother's newly-born child was in need of care and protection. The social worker had seen the mother early in her pregnancy and again when she came to the hospital with her child after giving birth at home alone. The mother was diagnosed by a psychiatrist as suffering from chronic paranoid schizophrenia. The trial judge transferred permanent custody of the child to the department, finding that the mother suffered from serious psychological problems, and that the &quot;mother was unable to use sound judgment in caring for herself, and would be unable to use sound judgment in caring for her son.&quot; On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, finding that the trial judge's findings did not meet the level of specificity required for a finding that a parent was unfit and his language was conclusory and merely tracked the statute. The court held that it was not enough to state that the mother suffered from a mental disorder. Rather, it was necessary to detail the specific symptoms or delusions precipitated by the disorder that rendered the parent unfit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A lawsuit filed by a plaintiffs, corporation and others, against defendants, Commissioner of Revenue and others, that attacked the constitutionality of the Classification Act was before the court on reservation and report, without decision, by a single justice of the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation argued that there was no constitutional authority to tax real property by usage classification when the Classification Act was passed. Hence, the statute was then void and had to remain void despite the occurrence in fact of the condition of ratification of the constitutional amendment. The court concluded, in agreement with a previous order, that the Classification Act was not rendered unconstitutional in whole or in part by reason of (1) the enactment of the statute before the ratification of the pertinent constitutional amendment; (2) the requirement of the statute that taxation of real property by usage classification be implemented in those cities or towns certified as assessing real property at full value, while other cities or towns not so certified continued to operate under the unclassified taxation system; (3) the provision for exemption of electric and gas utilities from the property taxation and their taxation on a different basis called an &quot;excise&quot;; and (4) the allowance by the statute of a $ 5,000 exemption for each parcel of residential property, while defining condominium units, but not rental units, as such parcels.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's primary contention was that plaintiff could not seek reimbursement from it because defendant did not accept the provisions of the Act. The court noted that Mass. Gen.

The court held, however, that public service for remuneration in the commonwealth was creditable, regardless of whether the employer had accepted the Act. The court further held that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 32, &sect; 59A, applied to all governmental units, whether they had accepted the Act or not. The court rejected defendant's other contentions that the actuary's procedure for determining the extent of defendant's reimbursement obligation was flawed, that plaintiff failed to complied with the notice provisions of &sect; 59A, and that the trial court erred in awarding interest under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, &sect; 6C. Accordingly, the court affirmed the trial court's order, holding that defendant was obligated to reimburse plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded the case to the lower court for entry of a judgment denying the taxpayers' request for an injunction and declaring that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 3, &sect; 14 was constitutional. The court concluded that it had the power to restrain the expenditure of public funds where there was no &quot;constitutional right and power&quot; to use them for the intended purpose. The court reviewed the purposes and history of the legislative practice of beginning each day with an opening prayer in relation to the purposes and history of the governing constitutional amendments. The court rejected the taxpayers' challenge to ch. 3 &sect; 14, as the practice of employing legislative chaplains had a secular purpose, neither advanced nor inhibited religions, and did not create a great degree of government entanglement with religion or any political divisiveness.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect; 32; Senate No. 813, Ma.  Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect; 32; Senate No. 814, Ma.  Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect; 32A; and House No. 507, Ma.  Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The House of Representatives of the commonwealth of Massachusetts sent two questions to the court concerning four pending bills. The bills were Senate No. 777, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect; 32; Senate No. 813, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect;32; Senate No. 814, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect; 32A; and House No. 507, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect; 32. They all provided for mandatory prison sentences for drug dealers. The questions were (1) would the enactment of the bills be unconstitutionally vague, as to the definition of &quot;street value&quot; in excess of $ 25,000; and (2) would the bills' mandatory sentencing result in cruel and unusual punishment? The court answered both of the questions in the negative. The court held that the bills were not unconstitutionally vague because the expression &quot;street value&quot; possessed a clear meaning that was recognized in common speech as well as in numerous judicial decisions. The court also found that the mandatory sentencing was not so disproportionate to the crime that it shocked the conscience or offended fundamental notions of human dignity so as to be in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VIII or the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, art. XXVI.</SPAN></P>

The by-law was amended two years later prohibiting anyone from removing sand, loam or gravel from land not in public use out of the confines of the town. When the business operators continued their intercity earth removal, the board of selectmen of the town initially issued cease and desist orders. The business operators sought a ruling on the parties' stipulation of facts. The trial court determined that the by-law was arbitrary, unreasonable and invalid and dissolved the town's outstanding restraining order. The town assert that the trial court erred in finding that the by-law was an unreasonable and excessive exercise of power, it posed an impermissible burden on interstate and intrastate commerce, and unconstitutionally deprived the business operators of interests in their property. The court affirmed, holding by-law failed because it lacked a basis in either the earth removal statute or in the Home Rule Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff licensed mobile home park owners were granted direct appellate review to challenge the validity of an ordinance enacted by defendants, rent board, city, city clerk, director of public health, and the board of health. The Superior Court (Massachusetts) declared that the ordinance was constitutional and was properly enacted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to an emergency situation, the legislature enacted a bill to regulate rent increases in all licensed mobile home parks in the city that would take effect upon the city's acceptance. Acting pursuant to authority granted to it by the act, the city council adopted an ordinance that regulated mobile home parks. The ordinance was based upon a similar finding of an emergency as the special act, but did not contain any time limitations. The owners filed a complaint and alleged that the ordinance was unconstitutional because the special act was not properly enacted, and the special act denied them due process and equal protection of the laws. On appeal, the court found that under &sect; 8 of the Home Rule Amendment, the legislature had the authority to act upon a special law approved by the mayor and the city council. Because both entities approved the special act, the legislation was properly enacted. The court found no violation of the owners' right to due process and held that a termination provision was not a constitutionally required element. The court also found no violation of equal protection of the laws by the legislature's differentiating among cities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Commonwealth of Massachusetts filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a determination that the Commonwealth could contract with commercial appraisal firms to revalue the real estate in each defendant noncomplying municipality and a declaration that the State Treasurer could deduct the cost of that contract from the amount of state aid distributed to the municipality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth filed suit against municipalities that refused to comply with their constitutional and statutory duty to value their real property proportionately and reasonably as required by Mass. Const. art. 4, cl.1, &sect; 1 and Mass Gen. Laws ch. 59, &sect; 38. The Commonwealth sought a determination that the Commissioner of Revenue could contract with commercial appraisal firms to revalue the real estate in each noncomplying municipality and that the State Treasurer could deduct the cost of that contract from the amount of state aid that he would otherwise distribute to that municipality. The court granted judgment for the Commonwealth but held that the Commissioner did not have the authority, absent a court order, to enter into a contract on behalf of any municipality, without its consent, to obtain a revaluation of its real estate. However, the court held the Treasurer did have the authority to withhold state aid funds to pay the costs of the appraisal contracts. The court reasoned that no municipality could block the attainment of its constitutional and statutory obligation to achieve a fair valuation by failing to appropriate funds necessary to achieve that goal.</SPAN></P>

The association governed and regulated competitive sports among state schools, and its regulation had caused problems in a handful of schools where a girls' team but no boys' team existed in a particular sport. The court agreed with the attorney general that the rule was invalid and enjoined its application. The court noted that under the ERA classifications based on sex were subject to strict scrutiny of the same level required by the Fourteenth Amendment for racial classifications. The court rejected the association's purported justifications for the rule, which could not withstand strict scrutiny. The court held that less drastic solutions than the broad prohibition embodied in the association's rule could be tailored to address the purported reasons for the rule.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged that the prison sentences by the trial and appellate courts were grossly and unlawfully disparate from a codefendant's sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant. Defendant alleged that the prison sentences imposed on him totaling forty to fifty years, and later reduced by the appellate court to thirty to forty years, were grossly and unlawfully disparate from a codefendant's sentences to three years in a house of correction and an additional term of probation. The court affirmed. The judge did not make inappropriate comments to defense counsel when he advised defendant not to forgo any advantage that might accrue by means of plea bargaining. The sentences imposed were within the broad discretion afforded to the judge. The court saw ample justification for the sentences imposed. In addition to the nature of the offense, a wide variety of factors can be taken into account, such as defendant's character, background, and prior record. The court held that the trial court and the appellate court were justified in concluding that the co-defendant and defendant's widely disparate criminal records warranted widely disparate sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city owned a hydroelectric plant and had paid a property tax to the town based on an assessed valuation. The city challenged the assessment as overvalued and disproportionately assessed. The board ruled that the governing statutes afforded no relief to the city on the basis of a disproportionate assessment. The city appealed and the court held that fair cash value of the plant was fixed but that the city was entitled to an abatement by reason of disproportionate assessment. The court held that the board's finding that the statute adopting the value of the property was an assumption of that value was proper. The property had been given the same fair cash value for a period of 40 years and it had never been increased, nor had an abatement been sought. However, the later statutory scheme made it clear that property owned by the city was to be treated the same as property owned by other taxpayers. The other taxpayers were assessed at a set percentage of the fair cash value, and accordingly, the court held that the city was entitled to the same type of assessment. The matter was reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a petition for a writ of error in the court challenging the judgment of a Massachusetts superior court which entered judgment on a plea of guilty to murder in the second degree, assault with intent to commit rape, and armed robbery. Following two hearings, a special master filed a report, and a justice reported the issues raised by that report.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the voluntariness of his plea of guilty to murder in the second degree on the grounds that he was not informed of the malice aforethought element of the crime and that defense counsel was ineffective. The court found merit only as to defense counsel's ineffective argument on disposition. The court held that defendant had admitted facts constituting the unexplained element by virtue of admitting facts which established armed robbery, which conclusively established malice aforethought in the murder. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to investigate an insanity defense, because defense counsel reasonably believed that an insanity plea was unlikely to succeed. The decision to plead guilty to second-degree murder rather than risk imposition of the death penalty if the insanity defense failed was a reasonable, tactical decision on the part of counsel. However, counsel's argument at disposition was so inadequate and misdirected that it could not be treated as a trial tactic, where the argument stressed the kindness of the victim and the horror of the crime, and failed to mention the existence of substantial mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the superior court's judgment of conviction as to all counts, and affirmed the mandatory life sentence imposed on the murder indictment.

The court held that a termination under &sect; 20D related to &quot;conduct,&quot; &quot;capacity,&quot; &quot;character,&quot; &quot;quality,&quot; and that the police officers knew they were in &quot;a status of experimental testing&quot; which &quot;implied no commitment for continuance of employment.&quot; Thus, the court concluded that the notices complied with &sect; 20D because they particularized when they identified observed characteristics of the police officers and therefore affirmed the superior court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the superior court's judgment in favor of the board in the police officers' action for declaratory and other relief for their termination as probationary intermittent police officers for the town.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that his constitutional right to cross-examine adverse witnesses on the issue of bias was infringed and that he should have been granted a new trial or, alternatively, that the court should have reduced the verdict to manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was convicted of murder in the second degree, contended on appeal that his constitutional right to cross-examine adverse witnesses on the issue of bias was infringed, that the evidence of an independent crime was erroneously admitted, that there was insufficient credible evidence to warrant his conviction, and that the substitution of an alternate juror for a juror who became ill violated his constitutional right to a jury trial. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that there was no error that required the court to exercise its authority under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278, &sect; 33E. In support, the court held that the trial judge was entitled to balance the conflicting interests and to conclude, as a matter of judicial discretion, that subsequent arrest records could be kept from the jury. The court also found that the trial judge's strong cautionary instructions were more than adequate to protect defendant's rights. Further, the court held that the substitution of an alternate juror for the juror who became ill during deliberations did not deprive defendant of his right to trial by jury.</SPAN></P>

The district court appealed, and the judgment of the superior court was reversed and remanded. The court held that there was no showing that the denial of public access impaired the ability of the district court to function, and that the limitation of the alphabetical index to the public did not exceed permissible limits or invade any constitutional right of the publisher.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth sought review of a decision of a Massachusetts superior court, which, prior to a retrial, suppressed testimony of a Commonwealth witness that was discovered as a result of an illegal wiretap warrant. Defendants had previously been convicted of conspiracy to commit larceny and to utter and public forged instruments but were granted a new trial based upon the illegal warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A wiretap warrant was based upon a false affidavit of a federal agent, and the Commonwealth agreed to a new trial because of the false information. On retrial, the Commonwealth did not object to the suppression of direct evidence from the warrant but objected to the exclusion of the testimony of a key witness. The trial court found that the flagrance of the unlawful conduct overrode any mitigating factors such as Miranda warnings. The court remanded because the trial judge did not assess the voluntariness of the witness's decision to testify. The court found that the trial court was required to consider not only the misconduct but also the closeness of the link between the misconduct and the testimony sought to be suppressed. It the connection was sufficiently attenuated, then the testimony was admissible. The trial court was required to consider factors such as whether the witness was coerced or whether he had voluntarily decided to share what he knew with the police and the court. On remand, the Commonwealth had the ultimate burden to show that the evidence was not tainted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After dinner and drinks, the victim and defendant went back to the motel room where defendant was staying. The victim tried to drive home; she stopped in a parking lot and went to sleep. Defendant took her back to his room, beat her, and forced her to engage in intercourse, cunnilingus, and fellatio. The victim thought that defendant drugged her. At trial, the defense argued consent. The judge instructed the jury that lack of consent was an element of the crime of rape but not on the other charge. The jury acquitted defendant of rape and convicted him of an unnatural and lascivious act. The court held that: (1) the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a directed verdict, (2) the court did not have to dismiss the indictment based on a decision of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit that held Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 35 was vague as applied in that case, and (3) the jury may have found defendant not guilty of rape due to consent; because defendant had argued consent on both charges and received the instruction on only one charge, fundamental fairness required a new trial on the charge of committing an unnatural and lascivious act with another person.</SPAN></P>

The Commonwealth argued that the plain meaning of &quot;in charge of&quot; in &sect; 25 implied the exercise of general dominion over a vehicle or the right to control it. The court held that defendant's motion for a directed verdict on the &sect; 25 charge should have been granted because the officer's demand of defendant's license was improper because at the time of demand, defendant was not operating or in charge of a motor vehicle, a condition precedent to application of &sect; 25. The court agreed with defendant that operating or in charge of connoted active control of a vehicle by a driver placed either in the vehicle or in such physical proximity that he might drive away. In the context of &sect; 25, &quot;operating or in charge of&quot; plainly referred to a more specific and immediate physical control.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asked to proceed pro se in his trial on charges of armed assault with intent to murder and unlawful carrying of a firearm. Numerous continuances were granted at his request to accommodate other criminal actions pending against him. After a trial date was finally set, defendant asked to represent himself. The trial court cautioned him, but he insisted on proceeding without counsel. The court appointed a legal advisor. On the day of trial, defendant sought a continuance, indicating insufficient time to prepare for trial, and asking to abandon his self-representation. The court denied his request and defendant was convicted. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed. The court found that defendant had ample time during the continuances to prepare for trial. The court acknowledged the importance of counsel, but held that defendant did not have an absolute right at the moment of trial to retract his decision to represent himself. The court noted that even if defendant had that right, the tardiness of the request placed it within the trial court's broad discretionary power, when faced with dilatory tactics, to take reasonable measures to keep the proceedings moving forward.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the Massachusetts Home Mortgage Finance Agency (agency), brought an action against defendant bank under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 213A, seeking a determination of a controversy between the parties and a declaration of rights under a prior agreement. The agency had agreed to sell, and the bank had agreed to buy, bond anticipation notes issued by the agency. The bank argued that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agency, created by 1974 Mass. Acts c. 846 and amended by 1977 Mass. Acts c. 561 (the statute), was authorized to promote the expansion and supply of funds at low interest rates available for new residential mortgages for persons and families of low and moderate incomes. The agency raised funds by entering into an agreement with the bank where the agency would sell, and the bank would buy, bond anticipation notes issued by the agency. Pursuant to an opinion by its counsel, the bank refused to honor the agreement, and litigation ensued. The bank argued that the statute was unconstitutional and the agency sought to enforce its agreement. The court found that the statute was constitutional and that the bank was obligated to honor the agreement. The court held that under Mass. Const. Part II, c. 1, &sect; 1, art. 4, the legislature could only use public money for public purposes, but that the statute furthered a public purpose because it promoted low income housing with only incidental benefit to moderate income persons. The court held that the legislature could determine how to provide low income housing relief without judicial interference.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the statute creating the agency was constitutional and that the bank was obliged to purchase the notes pursuant to its agreement. The court found that the statute served a public purpose and that the legislature could decide how to provide housing relief without judicial interference. The court found that the statute did not delegate excessive authority to the agency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Agents of defendant Department of Banking and Insurance entered plaintiff insurance broker's business premises and demanded to examine his books and records, claiming authority under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 176D, &sect; 5. A local television station later broadcast a news story containing personal data about plaintiff obtained through that search. Plaintiff brought an action against defendant, seeking injunctive relief and damages, alleging violations of the Fair Information Practices Act (FIPA), Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 66a, &sect; 2. Plaintiff further sought declaration that a search under ch. 176D, &sect; 5 could only be made pursuant to a search warrant, and declaration that if ch. 176D, &sect; 5 did authorize a warrantless search, it was unconstitutional. The lower court dismissed the action, and the supreme court granted plaintiff's request for direct appellate review. Reversing, the court held that plaintiff's complaint sufficiently alleged a cause of action for declaratory relief; that plaintiff, as a sole proprietor, had a right to sue under FIPA and under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 214, &sect; 3B; and that his complaint sufficiently alleged a cause of action against defendant to recover under FIPA.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 272, &sect; 16 and of being a lewd, wanton, and lascivious person in speech or behavior pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 53. Defendant appealed, contending that &sect; 53 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court affirmed the conviction for open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior but reversed and set aside the conviction for being a lewd, wanton, and lascivious person in speech or behavior, and dismissed the indictment therefore. The court concluded that the behavior complained of had to affect or be likely to affect persons in a place to which the public or a substantial group had access. The portion of the statute under which the defendant was charged could not apply to private conduct between two people in the home in which they lived. The conduct of defendant occurred in the home in which he lived with the victim, his stepdaughter, and did not fall within the purview of the statute as it was worded, which made the statute vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was reserved and reported to the court by the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County (Massachusetts). Plaintiffs, automobile manufacturer and automobile dealer, sought a declaration that certain provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B regulating the granting by car manufacturers of new dealership franchises that would compete with established franchises were unconstitutional. Defendant was a competing automobile dealer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the statute was a constitutional exercise of the legislature's authority. The statute fell within the legislature's powers of economic regulation and the provisions aimed at unfair coercion of dealers had evident justifications. The court also held that the statute did not violate the Commerce Clause because the statute was applied equally to in-state and out-of-state businesses, furthered a legitimate state interest, and did not unreasonably burden interstate commerce. The court further held that there could be no antitrust violation because federal anti-trust law did not apply to restraints that emanated from state legislation rather than from the actions of individuals. Finally, the court rejected the manufacturer's and dealer's challenge to the law on due process grounds. The court noted that the state's police power modified the private right to carry on business as one wished, and that the challenged provisions of the statute were adequately specific.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded to the county court with directions to enter an appropriate declaratory judgment regarding the constitutional question reported.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city dwellers sought an injunction against the city and its employees from taking certain action to influence the outcome of the vote on the classification amendment. They asked that the city be enjoined from spending any city funds, allowing any city employee to devote any time or service, or allowing any person to use any city resources. In a previous proceeding the court had enjoined the city from expending appropriated funds on classification. The court declined to issue an injunction or to make any specific declaration concerning the lawful limits of conduct by a municipal employee during working hours in support of the classification amendment. Individual city employees could have certain rights of speech, even during working hours, concerning the classification amendment, and it was preferable that they be heard before any injunction, which could affect those rights was issued. Any further order from the court on the question on the conduct of city employees was not possible on the record. All relief to which the city dwellers were entitled could be granted in a 10-taxpayers' action so the court did not to consider whether they had standing to seek declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>

The issue on appeal was whether the declaratory judgment statute could be utilized to obtain a judicial determination whether a particular film was obscene before the film had been exhibited or distributed within the commonwealth and before there had been a threat of prosecution.The court affirmed the judgment.The court concluded that the film distributor's action was a request for an advisory opinion. The district attorney had not threatened prosecution or deemed the film to be in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect;&sect; 29-31, and an allegation that the film contained explicit sexual congress was insufficient to show that an actual controversy existed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because petitioner was indigent, counsel was appointed to represent him on appeal of his armed robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon conviction. The trial judge denied the request for a free full transcript of the trial and directed counsel to narrow the issues for review. Petitioner sought relief from the denial. The petition was denied. The court reversed, concluding that petitioner was entitled to the full trial transcript on statutory grounds. The petitioner did not seek appellate review by any of the methods in which the transcript played a limited role. Instead, he filed a direct appeal pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278, &sect;&sect; 33A-33H, under which a transcript had to be provided either at petitioner's expense or free of charge if he was indigent. There was no suggestion that a partial transcript was adequate if the indigent defendant was unable to support his grounds of appeal with specific factual allegations. A procedure that based the grant of a free transcript on petitioner's ability to substantiate the allegations of trial error would have frustrated the legislative purpose of expedient and effective appellate review.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the state constitution prohibited the establishment of religion and that loaning textbooks directly to private school students was the establishment of religion.

The lienholder had brought a separate action, which was dismissed, but it was allowed to intervene in the consolidated forfeiture suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth sought the forfeiture of the vehicles under Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 94C, &sect; 47(a)(3) because the owner, a criminal defendant, was involved in unlawful drug activity. The lienholder assumed the burden of the defense. The essence of the lienholder's appeal was that the forfeiture procedure violated substantive and procedural due process by depriving it of its interests in the vehicles. On appeal, the court disagreed. Given that the lienholder did appear and contest the forfeiture, the alleged lack of notice of the seizure and forfeiture was not reversible error. The lienholder was not entitled to notice before the actual seizure as opposed to the forfeiture. Forfeiture was an &quot;extraordinary situation&quot; where notice and an opportunity for a hearing could have been postponed. Case law held that forfeiture proceedings did not deprive persons or entities such as the lienholder of its property rights. Forfeitures served the valuable policy of deterring criminal behavior. Further, it served the policy of encouraging third parties to use greater care in transferring property to drug violators.</SPAN></P>

The state tax commission refused the abatement and the appellate tax board ruled that the sales were not exempt from taxation. The taxpayer sought review and the court affirmed. The court held that the state was not prohibited from taxing the sales under the commerce clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The court said that a state tax was valid under the commerce clause if it was applied to an activity that had a substantial nexus with the taxing state, was fairly apportioned, did not discriminate against interstate commerce, and was fairly related to state-provided services. The court found that the taxpayer's activities had a substantial nexus with the state because all of those activities up until the time the fundraising packages were mailed took place in the state.

Defendant also stole the victim's car. Defendant was arrested in Kentucky, and while in custody, defendant was questioned by Massachusetts police officers. Defendant received his Miranda warnings, and during questioning, requested counsel. The detectives continued to question defendant, and elicited certain inculpatory statements from him. Defendant requested counsel a second time, and the questioning was terminated. Defendant later made more statements to the officers after he called his mother and sister rather than calling an attorney. The trial court excluded only the statements defendant made after his initial request for counsel. The trial court admitted defendant's subsequent statements, ruling that defendant's failure to call a lawyer with his allotted phone call and subsequent statements constituted a valid waiver of his right to counsel during questioning. The court agreed with the trial court's assessment and affirmed defendant's convictions, after rejecting the remainder of defendant's contentions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In connection with consideration of a bill to require the executive department to expend in full all sums appropriated by the legislature, and not to expend any such sums for any purpose other than the one for which it was appropriated, the Senate asked the court four questions relating to the constitutionality of the pending bill. The court answered that the governor had the constitutional prerogative to spend less than the full amount of an appropriation. However, the mechanism provided in the bill for resolving the dispute implicit in a refusal by the governor to expend an appropriated sum in its entirety violated the constitutional requirement that no bill become a law until laid before the governor for his revisal. Accordingly, the over-all scheme of the bill was rendered unconstitutional because the blanket prohibition against less than full expenditure eliminated any possible exercise of gubernatorial discretion, even where the social purpose of the underlying legislation was not compromised. A provision requiring the governor to submit revenue-raising proposals to the legislature in the event of an anticipated revenue shortfall did not violate the separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff registered voters sought a declaratory judgment that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 47, &sect; 4 (1977) violated Mass. Const. art. 101, &sect; 1. The case was first filed in the court as a complaint in the nature of mandamus, but was transferred to the Suffolk County Court (Massachusetts), where it was reported without decision. Plaintiffs alleged that the statute was unconstitutional as it applied to the two representative districts in question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the statute, in so far as it established the two districts in question, did not violate article 101; thus, the court denied plaintiffs' request for an injunction restraining defendant Secretary of the Commonwealth from preparing for an election in the districts. The court examined the words of &quot;as nearly as may be,&quot; which were included within redistricting language of several constitutional provisions. Article 101 required that the Legislature divide the Commonwealth into 160 districts, and that the districts were to be formed, as nearly as may be, without uniting two counties, or a city and a town, into one district. The Legislature, by enacting the statute, divided the Commonwealth into 160 districts, but in the process crossed over county lines 19 times; it also formed some districts by uniting cities and towns into one district. The court held that the primary constitutional responsibility for the apportionment of representative districts rested with the Legislature, and that the function of the courts in considering the constitutionality of the action of the Legislature was limited in scope. The court concluded that plaintiffs did not sustain their burden.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the injunctive relief sought by plaintiffs. The court entered judgment declaring that the statute did not violate the provisions of the constitution in so far as it established the two representative districts in questions.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 138, &sect; 12, because of acts of prostitution on the premises.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lounge's license was revoked because of acts of prostitution and gross lewdness on the premises. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the board's order had conformed to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 138, &sect; 64, notwithstanding the board's failure to issue procedural rules. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requirement that agencies adopt regulations governing its procedures did not apply to the board because it was not an agency within the meaning of the APA. It was enough that the board had provided notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard. Even were the board an agency, any inadequacy in its conduct was immaterial because the renewed proceeding on appeal to the commission conformed to the APA. That was so even though the commission took in the transcript of the board hearing, because the transcript was supplemented by other evidence open to challenge and contradiction by the lounge. Finally, the fact that the trial court had agreed with the lounge that the gross lewdness claim should not have been considered by the board, did not require remanding the case to the commission, because the prostitution incidents fully supported the revocation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which upheld the revocation of the lounge's alcohol license.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 40A, that the town was not authorized to regulate the form of ownership, and that the by-law was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court order finding the by-law valid. The court held that Mass. Gen. Law ch. 183A did not create an exception to the Zoning Enabling Act. The court found that while the by-law was worded in terms of the type of ownership, it was valid under the Zoning Enabling Act as a regulation of change of use. The court noted that the town was empowered to inhibit the expansion of such a non-conforming use from a seasonal to a year-round basis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an order adopted by the Massachusetts Senate, the senate propounded nine questions upon the court regarding an initiative petition seeking passage of a proposed law, which would require certain state and county public officials and employees, as well as candidates for elective and certain appointive state and county offices, to disclose their financial interests publicly each year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded, inter alia, that the proposed law would not violate the right to privacy of those required to file financial interest statements nor of the members of their immediate families or of those whose relationships with them must be disclosed, in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Nor would the disclosure required constitute an unreasonable search under Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 14. Therefore, the court concluded that the proposed law would not violate any right to privacy of the declarants, their immediate families, or those, whose relationships with them must be disclosed. However, the court concluded that the provision, which prohibited a public official from taking the oath of office unless he filed a financial interests statement would intrude on an area of concern reserved exclusively to each house of the general court, and would be void as applied to members of the Massachusetts Senate and House of Representatives.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The public interest research group sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the enforcement of the county-distribution requirement. The requirement restricted the number of signatures that could qualify from any one county on behalf of an initiative or referendum petition to not more than one-quarter of the total number needed to qualify. The public interest research group questioned the validity of the county-distribution requirement. The court first found that the public interest research group had no standing, but individuals named in the complaint did, so the court found the issue was not dispositive. The court held that the county-distribution rule had a rational basis, and it was sufficient that this rule was reasonably calculated to keep proposals of exclusively local concern off the ballot. Therefore, the rule did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants filed suit against the Attorney General seeking a declaration that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect; 34, which prohibited under penalty the knowing possession of marihuana, was unconstitutional at least as applied to the personal possession of a small amount of marihuana. Appellants contended that legislation which went to the extreme of forbidding the possession in one's own home of a substance meant for personal use, invaded a constitutionally protected zone of privacy. The Attorney General filed a motion to dismiss the action contending that an attack on the laws regulating the possession of marihuana had been repelled by the court in a previous case. The court affirmed the superior court's judgment granting the Attorney General's motion to dismiss appellant's action and concluded that the freedom impaired by the statute did not reach the level of a constitutionally protected freedom. The court found that private use of marihuana had public results, spilled over into the public domain, and touched matters of legitimate state interest. As such, the Legislature had the power to act against the harmful effects of the drug even without identifying effects on others.</SPAN></P>

While defendants were appealing, three cases were decided involving the statute; defendants requested reconsideration of certain holdings in those cases. They also claimed that the survey was improperly excluded. The court affirmed the judgments. The obscenity statute, which required that the matter taken as a whole appealed to the prurient interest of the average person applying the contemporary standards of the commonwealth and was patently offensive, was not unconstitutionally vague. There was no requirement for the government to introduce expert evidence of the standards, as long as the trier of fact applied, not personal views, but the views of the average person in the commonwealth as a whole. Although public opinion surveys were admissible in certain circumstances, it was not error to exclude the survey here, which was not shown to be representative and was not relevant to the question of patent offensiveness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, officers and owner, appealed an order of the Superior Court (Massachusetts) enjoining the officers from maintaining an illegal liquor nuisance on the owner's property and the owner from using the property as a package store for one year, as requested by plaintiff taxpayers in their action under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 138, &sect; 60, and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 139, &sect; 16A, to abate the use of a building unlawfully being used as a liquor nuisance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officers were family members who, collectively, held 100 percent of the stock in six corporations, which held 8 package store licenses, and operated business in the family's name. The taxpayers brought an action to enjoin the officers from doing business on the owner's property, which they leased, on the grounds that the building was being used for the illegal keeping of alcoholic beverages, in violation of &sect; 16A. On appeal, the court rejected the officers' and the owner's argument that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 138, &sect; 15, which prohibited any &quot;combination of persons&quot; directly or indirectly from holding more than three package store licenses, was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the terms of &sect; 15 were not overly vague because the statute as a whole set forth definite guidelines, that holdings of less than 10 percent of corporate stock were not an indirect beneficial interest. Thus, the court ruled, holdings of more than 10 percent supported the inference that there was a direct or indirect interest. The court concluded that the trial court properly found that the officers' activities in the six corporations constituted a violation of the liquor licensing statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment enjoining the officers from operating their package store on the owner's property and restricting the owner from using the building as a package store for one year.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgments dismissing the licensees' complaints for judicial review of the suspensions. There was substantial evidence to support the liquor commission's findings of fact. The licensees had no standing to challenge regulations prohibiting the dancers from mingling with the patrons on due process grounds because the regulations were not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the licensees. The regulations did not violate any freedom of speech or assembly because states had the right, under the Twenty-first Amendment, to exercise controls on the exercise of First Amendment rights in establishments dispensing liquor in situations where such restraints would be unacceptable elsewhere.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Investigators from the Commission entered the licensed premises and purchased drinks from a female dancer. The dancer then placed an investigator's hand between her thighs and placed her hand on the investigator's groin. The dancer asked the investigator to by her champagne and took him to a back booth. The touching continued until the investigator refused to buy more champagne. On appeal, the court found that the dancer's actions took place in view of others in a public area. The Commission suspended restaurant's license. The superior court and its appellate court upheld the suspension. On appeal, the court stated that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 26 prohibited the licensed corporation form allowing its employees to participate in immoral solicitation. The court found that the corporation had had fair warning that it was illegal to knowingly permit its employee to act as the dancer did. By her conduct in a public place, the dancer engaged in acts of prostitution. Section 26 fairly applied to the conduct of the corporation's employee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff felon sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court (Massachusetts), which found in favor of defendant police chief in an action brought when defendant revoked plaintiff's license to sell guns after plaintiff testified against defendant. Plaintiff claimed defendant improperly considered plaintiff's record that was sealed under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, &sect; 100A, slanderously published the record, and violated 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In order to obtain a license for selling guns, plaintiff felon's record was sealed pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, &sect; 100A. Subsequently, defendant police chief revoked the license based on plaintiff's record after plaintiff testified against defendant before a grand jury. Thereafter, plaintiff brought an action, claiming defendant had improperly considered the sealed record, had slanderously published the record, and had violated 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. When the superior court found in favor of defendant, plaintiff sought review, and the court affirmed and reversed. In affirming, the court held &sect; 100A provided any law enforcement agency, court, or appointing authority with access to sealed criminal records. The court also held &sect; 100A had not operated to erase plaintiff's prior conviction, and thus, the prior conviction's truth had been an absolute defense to slander. In reversing, the court held that because plaintiff had alleged a denial of a governmental benefit in retaliation for testimony before a grand jury, plaintiff had stated a cause of action under &sect; 1983 based on U.S Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment in favor of defendant police chief in an action brought when defendant revoked plaintiff felon's license to sell guns because defendant was authorized to access plaintiff's sealed records and the records' truth was a defense to slander despite being sealed. The court reversed a judgment against plaintiff on a civil rights action because a retaliatory denial of the license had given rise to a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the state charges of which he was convicted should have been barred by reason of a prior federal prosecution. However, on appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court determined that there was nothing unconstitutional about a state prosecution that was precisely duplicative of a prior federal trial. Nevertheless, the court held that there had not already been a federal prosecution for substantially the same act or acts. Thus, the court held that the trial court properly dismissed two charges, but determined that defendant could stand trial for the remaining charges. Furthermore, the court held that the prosecutor's reference to the prior federal trial did not require that the trial court grant defendant's motion for a mistrial where there was no material prejudice and where unavoidably, the jury knew that defendant participated in a robbery. However, the court held that the trial court used care to instruct the jury that they were not to take the reference as indicative of defendant's guilt. Lastly, in pertinent part, the court determined that defendant's motion for a directed verdict of acquittal was properly denied as to all charges.</SPAN></P>

A dispute arose regarding the apportionment of the charges and expenses of the construction, maintenance, and running of the joint water works.

The commissioners determined that &sect; 13 required the parties to each pay 50 percent of the cost. Plaintiff filed objections and a motion to recommit the report. Defendant filed a motion for confirmation of the report. The court confirmed the commissioners' report and determined that the charges and expenses relative to the construction, maintenance, and running of the joint water works were to be borne equally by the towns. The court found that historically the towns had financed construction and improvement costs equally. Plaintiff argued that the equal apportionment of costs was unconstitutional because defendant developed more rapidly than plaintiff.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer sought injunctive and declaratory relief based on his claim that &sect; 99A was unconstitutional under Mass.

On review, the court held that the provisions of &sect; 99A applied equally by its terms to all cities and towns in the commonwealth. The court stated that the legislature had the authority to restrict local legislative action or deny municipalities the power to act at all. Whether the problems associated with residency requirements would better be left to municipal government rather than to the state legislature was therefore entirely within the discretion of the legislature to decide. The court noted that the action by the legislature indicated a clear intent to withdraw discretion from the municipalities and to impose the restriction as a matter of statewide policy. The court held that the commissioner was not equitably estopped from enforcing the residency requirements merely because it had not previously been enforced.</SPAN></P>

The action was transferred to the court. The officer sought injunctive and declaratory relief based on the alleged unconstitutionality of the residency requirements of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 41, &sect; 99A under various provisions of the Massachusetts and United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer worked for a city police department. His complaint recited that the chief had informed all officers that the provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 41, &sect; 99A, and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, &sect; 48A, and certain police regulations were construed such that all officers were required to live within 10 miles of the city as measured by road miles from the officers' homes to the city limits. The officer averred that he had purchased a home located in a town whose boundary was within the city limits. The chief argued that the word &quot;mile&quot; meant the distance as measured along existing roads. The issue was whether the 10-mile distance should have been measured by &quot;road&quot; miles or otherwise. The court held that the statutes in question were valid and constitutional exercises of legislative power. The court reasoned that under ordinary meaning a &quot;mile&quot; was a measure of distance and was not a description of how to measure that distance. The court concluded that the chief's argument was not reflected in the language of the statute because the legislature did not use the term &quot;road miles&quot; and that the chief's construction was not a reasonable one.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the validity of the residency statutes and remanded the case to the superior court for proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

After appealing a district court conviction, defendants were convicted by a jury in the superior court. Defendants appealed and the court affirmed the convictions and held that Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 272, &sect; 40 was sufficiently definite to satisfy the notice requirements of the due process clause. Section 40 proscribed only such activity as actually created an interruption or disturbance of the normal functioning of a school. The limitations on the scope of the statute provided a person of common intelligence with sufficient notice of what the law prohibited; due process requirements were therefore satisfied. The statute did not prohibit expressive conduct or speech that was compatible with the free flow of ideas essential to the learning process. It merely insulated the schools from activity that so significantly disrupted their functioning as to impair the accomplishment of their educational goals. No constitutional protection could be extended to conduct, expressive or otherwise, that materially obstructed the operation of a school.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the developers' action. On appeal, the court affirmed.

Plaintiffs argued that ch. 365 deprived them of vested property interests in premium rates in violation of the due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and of Mass. Const.

Plaintiffs further argued that ch. 365 impaired the obligation of contracts between company and policyholder in violation of U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10, and that ch. 365 violated Mass. Const.

The court found that any governmental classification based solely on sex was subject to the application of the strict scrutiny-compelling state interest test.

Laws ch. 272, &sect; 53, in so far as it prohibited prostitution, was facially unconstitutional because its definition of proscribed conduct was vague, because it prohibited the status of being a prostitute, and because the statute proscribed conduct that was protected by the right of privacy. On appeal, the court held that the prostitution provision of &sect; 53 was not facially unconstitutional. The records did not show unconstitutional application of that provision to defendants. The Commonwealth proved the essential elements of the charge of prostitution because proof of solicitation by defendants for such acts was sufficient. As defined, &sect; 53 was not vague and the definition included conduct that persons of ordinary understanding would have classified as prostitution. Further, the convictions, relying on no private conduct, implicated no constitutionally protected rights of privacy. Such a conviction did not implicate a right of privacy, although a conviction for prostitution based on performance of sexual acts for hire could rely on conduct performed in private. The court found no error in the convictions for prostitution and common night walking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Six years after the alleged malpractice occurred, the minor patient and his father filed a complaint against the doctor. The doctor filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that plaintiffs' claim was not filed within the applicable statute of limitations. The trial court denied the motion and reported the question on the complaint, the motion for summary judgment, and the stipulated facts. On plaintiff's application for direct appellate review, the court held that defendant's motion for summary judgment should have been granted. Before 1976, the three-year medical malpractice statute of limitations began to run against a minor plaintiff only when he reached majority; however, the enactment of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, &sect; 60(D) changed the law to extend the three-year limitations period to a medical malpractice case like plaintiffs'. According to the court, even though plaintiffs' claim accrued before the shortened statute of limitations was enacted, the shortened period should have been applied to plaintiffs' case since the six month period from the date the statute was approved to the date when it took effect was a reasonable time to commence their action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the reported question determining that the shortened statute of limitations applied to plaintiffs' medical malpractice action and barred it; it was constitutional as applied. The court remanded the case to the trial court, where defendant's motion for summary judgment was to be allowed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts requested the opinion of the court concerning a bill that was pending before him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The questions presented to the court were whether the enactment of the bill would violate Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 12, would the bill invidiously discriminate against indigent grand jury witnesses without counsel, and if the bill did not invidiously discriminate against indigent witnesses, would statements before a grand jury, made by an indigent witness without counsel, have been constitutionally admissible against that person in a subsequent criminal proceeding. The court decided that the only constitutional violation that may have presented itself was that the presence of counsel might conceivably compromise the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. However, the court held that the extra person in the grand jury room would not have impaired seriously the fundamental aims or the role of secrecy. The court also held that there was no constitutional infirmity in the bill deriving from the requirement of equal protection under either the state or federal constitution. The bill did not expressly or impliedly require the appointment of counsel for indigents but it neither forbade any appointment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 231, &sect; 60B, plaintiffs brought their medical malpractice action against defendants before a medical malpractice tribunal.

When plaintiffs failed to post the bond, the trial court dismissed the suit. Plaintiffs sought review, contending that &sect; 60B was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal. The court held that the legislation was not patently offensive as there was a compelling state interest for imposing a bond on plaintiffs. The court held that the legislation did not deprive plaintiffs of procedural due process because the bond requirement did not deny them their constitutional right to be heard. The court held that the judge on the medical malpractice tribunal had wide discretion in setting the amount of the bond.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor (Massachusetts) submitted two questions to the court: 1). Was the Massachusetts Community Development Finance Corporation (CDFC) established for a valid public purpose for which public funds could be expended consistent with Mass. Const. pt. 2, art. 4, ch. 1, &sect; 1? 2). If so, could the commonwealth, consistent with Mass. Const. amend. art. 62, &sect; 1, borrow funds and purchase all of the capital stock of the CDFC?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered both questions in the affirmative. It held that the findings that the CDFC's directors had to make concerning each project and any target area would assure that the funds invested by the CDFC would be devoted to public purposes. By requiring these findings, as set forth in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40F, &sect; 4, the legislature adequately ensured that the funds invested by the CDFC would be expended primarily to confer direct public benefits and that any private advantage would be reasonably incidental to carrying out the public purpose. A community development corporation that expended funds in accordance with the conditions and limitations of &sect; 4 was not a private borrower. Therefore, the statutory pattern of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40F did not involve an unconstitutional lending of the credit of the commonwealth. The CDFC and community development corporations could use those funds for public purposes only. The commonwealth's credit was not being extended to a corporation that was privately owned and managed. The proceeds of the sale of the CDFC's common stock could be used only for approved projects of public benefit and only by a community development corporation.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected plaintiff's contention because the statutory change did not involve a greater or second penalty for the earlier offense.

Determining that the attorney general's authority to represent defendants in the appeal was questionable, the Supreme Court certified to the court the question of whether the attorney general was authorized to so act under state law. The court held that he was so authorized and stated that (1) the legislature consolidated the responsibility for all legal matters involving the state in the attorney general; (2) the attorney general was required to consider the ramifications of courses of action recommended by state agencies; and (3) the attorney general was empowered to decide matters of legal policy that would normally be reserved to the client in an ordinary attorney-client relationship.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the attorney general was authorized to pursue an appeal of a district court decision rendering void the Massachusetts veterans' preference statute even though the defendants in that suit, the civil service commission and the director of civil service, opposed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of conspiracy to steal money of a value of more than $ 100 from the Commonwealth and the court affirmed her conviction. Defendant and her husband deceived the Department of Public Welfare by stating that the husband did not live with defendant and their child during the time that she was receiving welfare payments from the department. The court found that the delay of 55 months from the time of indictment to the time of trial did not violate defendant's right to a speedy trial because she had not made any efforts to obtain a speedy trial and the Commonwealth did not act intentionally in not bringing the case to trial sooner and did not suffer any prejudice as a result of the delay. The court determined that defendant's husband's statement that he was living with defendant was properly admitted against defendant as a coconspirator. The court found that the lower court properly denied defendant's motion for directed verdict because the evidence amply supported a finding that both defendant and her husband knew of the unlawfulness of the receipt of funds from the Commonwealth under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the gynecological clinic was awaiting approval of its application for a determination of need, the town board passed an amendment to Town of Southborough, Mass., Zoning By-law &sect; IV, 7, which added &sect; VIII, 8, making an &quot;abortion clinic&quot; a prohibited use. The court remitted the case to the judge for entry of a judgment for the gynecological clinic, directors, physician, and potential patients because the amendment was invalid, as a serious abridgment of constitutional rights. The court found that the amendment, on its face, constituted an unjustified incursion into a woman's constitutionally protected right to terminate her pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. The court rejected the board's attempt to justify the amendment as an expression of the desires of its residents to favor adoption or on the ground that a woman could go elsewhere for an abortion.</SPAN></P>

The court declined to render a definite answer and submitted its opinion for the state senate's consideration. The court reasoned that it was possible that the legislation would have failed some constitutional challenges, and that the outcome of litigation on such lines would have partially depended on if adequate reasons or justifications could have been established for the restrictions that the bills imposed. The court also opined that the absence of a record of the developed facts and the reasons that were associated with the legislation precluded providing a definite answer as to the bills' validity. The court further found that advertisements that included price information would not have proposed illegal transactions in violation of U.S. Const. amend. 21, &sect; 2 because the commonwealth's residents were not barred from purchasing liquor elsewhere, and that those advertisements might have led the commonwealth's citizens to reconsider the wisdom of the commonwealth's present system of liquor regulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mass. Const. amend. art. 88 provided for the industrial development of the Commonwealth's cities and towns. The legislature enacted Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40D, which authorized cites and towns to make capital financing available to industrial enterprises at reduced interest rates. Originally, the legislature limited the potential recipients of public financial assistance to those who engaged in manufacturing enterprises. Because a substantial portion of the Commonwealth's economy was generated by businesses that were not primarily concerned with a manufacturing process, the legislature was considering whether to broaden the eligibility of businesses that qualified for financial assistance. The court determined that the words &quot;industrial development&quot; in Chapter 40D were not limited to manufacturing enterprises because the term &quot;industrial&quot; was a generic term, which included, among other things, assembling and processing. Moreover, the purpose of Mass. Const. amend. art. 88, which was to foster the expansion of the economy, was best advanced by including non-manufacturing enterprises within the term &quot;industrial development.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The city, school, and employees filed a motion to dismiss on grounds of governmental immunity. The court found (1) that the city, school, principals, and teachers were public officers whose ministerial conduct was not misfeasance, (2) that the officers were not immune from liability because personal injury from defective premises or negligence of the school was not a risk assumed by a student in the pursuit of public education, and (3) that the conduct of the school committee and superintendent in assigning the student to that particular school was discretionary conduct that fell outside the scope of liability.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State Attorney General issued three opinions which elaborated a common law principle that people were free to select or change their names freely if there was no fraudulent intent. The city and town clerks refused to follow those opinions and that principle in recording births and marriages, however, and asserted a power to determine people's surnames according to customary rules, regardless of the desires of the people concerned. The state officials brought the current action accordingly. The court found the Attorney General was correct and ordered that the rights of the individuals affected, individuals who hoped to change their names for various reasons, were to be respected. The court held that once the city and town clerks obtained the advice of the Attorney General on a question of law, it was no part of the duty of the clerks to substitute their legal judgment for that of the Attorney General. Because the common law principle of freedom of choice in the matter of names was not found out of harmony with modern conditions, that freedom of choice was to be respected.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 181, &sect; 4. Plaintiff was engaged only in interstate commerce, and the several machines which it owned and leased out within the commonwealth were mere incidents of its interstate business.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff dog racetrack operator sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court, Bristol County (Massachusetts), which, in the operator's complaint for a declaration that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40, &sect; 32 was an unconstitutional by-law passed by defendant city, held that the by-law was constitutional and denied the operator's request for injunctive relief against its enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed &sect; 32, which required the operator to request the chief of police to assign town police officers each racing night in the ratio of one officer to each 400 persons expected to be in attendance, and to compensate the officers at the prevailing extra duty rate. The operator's claim that &sect; 32 was unconstitutional failed at the superior court. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court rejected the operator's claim that &sect; 32 deprived him of property without due process of law. The object of &sect; 32 was to preserve the peace; this was an acknowledged purpose of the State. The operator claimed that &sect; 32 was invalid because it interfered more than was reasonably necessary with the operation of the racetrack. The operator asserted that the existing way of policing the racetrack was good enough. The court noted that such argument needed to be made to legislators, not to the court. The court also rejected the claim that &sect; 32 was preemptive and inconsistent. The court held that &sect; 32 was not intended to displace Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 128A, &sect; 8 that covered a comparable field. Further, the court noted that the city had never employed &sect; 8 against the operator.</SPAN></P>

The department claimed that the corporation violated its regulations, and the corporation sought a judgment that the regulations were unconstitutional and did not apply to its facilities. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The trial court's judgment enjoined the corporation from further violations of the regulations. The court affirmed and held that the regulations were reasonably related to the purposes of the enabling legislation and were therefore valid. The regulations bore an obvious rational relationship to the promotion of the public health and welfare, and access as guaranteed by the regulations was a reasonable means to attain the goals set by the Legislature to regulate reasonably the working and living conditions of migrant workers.

Defendant appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that the witness's confrontations with defendant were not so suggestive as to constitute a due process violation because the entire identification process was under circumstances free from the elements of unfairness. Even assuming the out-of-court identifications were one-on-one confrontations, they were permissible because they occurred promptly after the crime, the witness had previously given a description of defendant, and police took steps to minimize the suggestiveness of the setting. Defendant's due process rights were not violated by the witness's in court identification, in which defendant was alone, because the use of lineups was not constitutionally mandated and it was not based on a prior suggestive confrontation. The trial court did not err in excusing a juror on its own motion because Mass. Gen.

On appeal, he contended that he should have been granted a new trial pursuant to Mass. Gen.

The court affirmed the judgment, holding that none of the substantive issues argued showed any miscarriage of justice. A finding of murder in the first degree was justified, and entry of a verdict of any lesser degree was not urged by defendant or justified pursuant to the court's authority under &sect; 33E. Moreover, the superior court ruled correctly that the identification was not so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of misidentification. The superior court made an appropriate analysis of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the identification and found that there was no such suggestiveness as would violate due process. Defendant's challenge to the witness's in-court identification of him failed because the pre-trial identification procedures were not constitutionally defective.</SPAN></P>

Declaration of Rights arts. 1, 10, 12, or 26. The proposed bill was designed to provide a dual procedure for the imposition of capital punishment when a defendant had been charged with murder in the first degree. The first phase would consist of trial of the charge. The second phase would consist of a separate sentencing phase before the same trier in which argument and evidence may be adduced relevant to certain factors or standards described in the bill intended to single out those offenders who merit capital punishment. The trier would then decide whether sentence of death, rather than life imprisonment, was justified. If defendant were sentenced to death there would be a review by the Supreme Judicial Court. The court determined that the proposed capital punishment bill constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 26. The court concluded that the legislature had failed to provide how any legitimate state function would be more effectively served by capital punishment as opposed to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, subcontractor on a public works project, brought suit against defendant general contractor, seeking payment. Plaintiff prevailed, and attorney fees were awarded consistent with Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 149, &sect; 29.

In affirming the lower court's award, the court concluded that defendant failed to meet the heavy burden of showing that the classification of litigants was not rationally related to a legitimate state purpose, as was necessary to prove the statute unconstitutional. There was ample legislative justification for allowing reasonable legal fees to successful claimants and not to successful defendant contractors, as encouragement of prompt payment of a general contractor's obligation to subcontractors was a substantial statutory object.

Laws Ann. ch. 71, &sect; 68, which would have required all teachers in the public schools to lead their classes in a group recitation of the &quot;Pledge of Allegiance.&quot; Specifically, the governor sought the answer to two questions. First, the governor asked whether the amendment would be an unconstitutional infringement of teachers' rights under either U.S. Const. amend. I, or Mass. Const. art. 16. The court answered the question in the affirmative and held that the proposed amendment would have violated the teachers' first amendment rights because the compelled recitation, under the treat of fine, was an infringement on the rights to the freedom of expression, which included the right to remain silent. The court declined to answer the second question, which pertained to the constitutionality of the amendment with respect to the students, because it had already determined that the amendment would have been unconstitutional. .</SPAN></P>

Appellee deputy insurance commissioner informed appellant that hearings would be held to determine whether its licenses to any type of insurance should be suspended due to refusal to issue or renew policies.

On review, the court agreed that the nonrenewal notices sufficiently evidenced a refusal to issue policies in violation of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 175, &sect; 22E. However, the court could not determine whether the conclusion that the refusal was not required to protect company solvency was supported by substantial evidence, as appellee failed to comply with Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant newspaper challenged an order of a single justice of the court that dismissed the newspaper's action against the appeals court (Massachusetts) and its clerk under the &quot;superintendency&quot; statute,&nbsp;Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 211, &sect; 3, seeking a judgment vacating an impoundment order. The impoundment order had been issued in the course of a separate litigation between intervenor bank and the Commissioner of Banks of the Commonwealth (commissioner).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspaper sought to publish information regarding the potential removal of the bank president and several board members that was contained in the court files of the underlying litigation filed by the bank against the commissioner. The newspaper alleged that the impoundment order was a violation of the public records provisions of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 66, &sect; 10, requiring the custodian of such records to permit inspection on request by any person. On appeal, the court held that, as subparagraph (a) of &sect; Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 4, &sect; 7(26) exempted records specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, the commissioner, as custodian, was relieved by Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 167, &sect; 2 of any duty to disclose the reports of examination to the newspaper. Viewed as court records, however, the reports were outside the range of the provisions of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 66, &sect; 10 regarding inspection. Nevertheless, the court held that the policy of the banking laws, specifically Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 167, &sect; 5, supported the impoundment order as the underlying litigation was an attempt to forestall an administrative removal proceeding and it had not gone beyond the stage of a preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporations, licensees of community antenna television (CATV) systems, brought an action against defendant Community Antenna Television Commission (commission) to invalidate certain of its regulations and for an adjudication that they were entitled to rate increases proposed by them. After plaintiffs' petition under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 166A, &sect; 15 had been denied by their issuing authority, they applied to the commission for relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought the action before the commission had rendered its final decision. A single justice referred the action to a special master and, upon confirmation of the master's report, a partial summary judgment was entered in effect approving those rate increases. Thereafter a single justice reserved and reported the whole case to the full court for disposition. The court held that the regulations in question were valid, and that the issue of the proposed increases in rates was for the commission in the first instance and not for the court. The reference to the master, with the consequent partial summary judgment, was not appropriate because plaintiffs had not exhausted their administrative remedies. The court stated that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 166A, &sect; 15 cast on the commission responsibilities both for the charges to the public and the returns to the licensees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded to the single justice for the reversal of the partial summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed a declaratory action concerning taxes, arguing that defendant tax commission misconstrued Mass.

The parties moved for summary judgment, and the supreme court granted plaintiffs' request for direct appellate review. Upon review, the court noted that &quot;net operating income&quot; was defined as gross income from all sources less certain items, including &quot;operating expenses,&quot; an undefined term. At the time the statute was enacted, defendant publicly adopted the position that dividend payments were not operating expenses and were not allowable deductions. Determining that defendant's position was entitled to some weight in resolving statutory ambiguity and, after assessing the status of association members and the views of Congress and the federal courts, the court concluded that plaintiffs' argument lacked merit and ordered entry of a declaratory judgment in defendant's favor.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court certified to the court the following question: Were city traffic regulations implementing a resident-only parking system, adopted pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 455, as amended by Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 340 (1972), constitutional as applied to defendant? The court answered the question in the affirmative, holding that: (1) the regulation dealt rationally with the public interest in reducing highway congestion and air pollution; (2) the placing of motor vehicles of residents of the city in a category apart from all other motor vehicles was not irrational; and (3) defendant failed to meet the burden of proving that the classification by the traffic director was invidiously discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

As a result of criminal prosecutions for violations of the Sunday closing law, the retailer brought an action to challenge the constitutionality of exemptions under the statute as violative of the Equal Protection Clause. The court entered a judgment for the state, holding that the retailer failed to meet its burden of demonstrating a lack of any conceivable basis to the challenged exemptions. The retailer only succeeded in proving a general, if not uniform, pattern of compliance and enforcement of the statute and a miniscule percentage of retail outlets falling within the challenged exemptions. Thus, in light of the record, the court concluded that the statute, even with its 49 exemptions, accomplished its purpose of providing a common day of rest in substantial part. As such, it could not be said that the exemptions in operation were so numerous as to obscure any legitimate state purpose. So long as the particular exemptions had a rational basis consistent with the statutory purposes they passed constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that there was error in the denial of his motion for a directed verdict and in the instructions to the jury on the subject of licensing because there was no evidence to show that defendant did not have a license to carry a firearm. The court disagreed. The holding of a valid license brought defendant within an exception to the general prohibition against carrying a firearm and was an affirmative defense. Absence of a license was not an element of the crime. In the absence of evidence with respect to a license, no issue was presented with respect to licensing. A requirement that defendant exhibit his license in court did not violate due process rights. The charge in the present case did not direct a verdict against defendant because the absence of a license, as the court pointed out, was not an element of the crime. Taken as a whole, the instructions fairly presented the case to the jury.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 29. Defendant's motions to dismiss were denied by the Suffolk County Court (Massachusetts) and defendant petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the disputed publications constituted books, not magazines, and that the proceeding under &sect; 29 was premature because Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 28I, required certain in rem procedures as conditions precedent to those proceedings that involved books. The court found that the element of periodicity distinguished books from magazines and was directly relevant to the legislative purpose in providing in rem procedures for the adjudication of books' obscenity. The court also found that defendant presented adequate evidence of the publications' completeness and lack of periodicity through testimony and through the publications themselves. The court held that defendant's motions to dismiss were erroneously denied because the commonwealth was required to meet the requirements of &sect; 28I before instituting proceedings against dissemination of the publications and had failed to do so. The case was remanded with directions that judgments of dismissal be entered as to both complaints.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Superior Court (Massachusetts), which convicted him of possessing obscene magazines with intent to disseminate them in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 29. Defendant contended that the statutory scheme was unconstitutional, that the trial court erred in the admission of evidence, and that the denial of his motion to dismiss for failure to comply with Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 28I was error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the obscenity statutes, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect;&sect; 28C-32, were not unconstitutionally vague in their proscription of the dissemination of obscene matter. The court also found that they did not violate the equal protection provisions of the state and federal constitutions in their different procedural treatment of books and other matter. The failure to unambiguously define &quot;books&quot; in the obscenity statutes did not render the statutory scheme unconstitutionally vague because defendant had notice of his potential liability for dissemination of such obscene materials. The reference to the obscene material as &quot;magazines&quot; at trial did not constitute prejudicial error because the appropriate classification of materials was a question to be decided by the trial court, not by the jury. The jury's duty was only to decide if the publication was obscene. The court remanded for a hearing on the proper classification of the materials and defendant's motion to dismiss for the State's failure to proceed against the books in rem under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect;&sect; 28C-32.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded to the trial court for a hearing on defendant's motions to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
