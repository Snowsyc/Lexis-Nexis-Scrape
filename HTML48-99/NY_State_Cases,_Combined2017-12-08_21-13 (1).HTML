</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner former wife sought an upward modification of a child support award in a divorce decree entered in Mexico based upon changed circumstances. Respondent former husband sought a downward modification of the child support award in the divorce decree. The wife filed a motion to dismiss the husband's cross-petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife argued that N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 466(c) did not allow for a downward modification of an award of child support in a divorce decree. The wife alleged further that the court was bound by the principles of comity not to lower the child support award. Upon review, the court concluded that N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 466(c) allowed for either upward or downward modification of the child support award. The court determined that, under principles of comity, the court had the power to deny even prima facie validity to the judgments of foreign countries for policy reasons. The court held that to permit a former wife to seek upward modification of alimony provisions contained in a foreign divorce decree on the ground of change of circumstances, yet deny the same right to a divorced husband to seek downward modification under N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 466(c), would have been violative of the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. 14, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Support provisions for wife and children, in a separation agreement, were incorporated in a Mexican divorce decree; and the wife subsequently applied to the New York Family Court for enforcement -- not modification -- of those provisions.  Thereupon the husband properly cross-moved for a downward modification of the support provisions, on account of change of circumstances.  Even if the Mexican court has no power to modify its own divorce decrees, our Family Court has been given the power of enforcing or modifying the alimony provisions; and of course, the children were not parties to the agreement or the divorce and they are not bound by those support provisions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff father brought an action against defendant property clerk for improperly invoking forfeiture of an automobile after his son, who sold him the car, was sentenced for killing two people.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son owned the vehicle when he took a gun from the car and used it in the killings. The police took possession of the parked vehicle. The son was ultimately sentenced to prison. The father objected to the forfeiture of the car. The property clerk claimed that the sale to the father was invalid by virtue of the son's murder sentence. The court found that there was no lawful basis for the forfeiture because the vehicle was not an instrument of the crimes. Under New York City, N.Y. Admin. Code &sect; 435, the assignment of the vehicle to the father, prior to sentencing, was valid, and forfeiture was inappropriate. When the assignment was made, the son possessed all his civil rights; no encumbrance to or suspension of his civil rights existed. He was free to fully exercise such civil rights to sell the car. Moreover, the car was used by the son for the purpose of transporting himself to a restaurant. He did not operate the motor vehicle with a view to committing the murders in which he was subsequently involved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled that the father was entitled to retain the car and that it was not subject to forfeiture by the property clerk.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man accidentally met and quarreled with another man and woman, and then went to his own parked car nearby and took a gun out of the glove compartment, and returned to the sidewalk where the other two were standing, and there he shot and killed both of them.  Several hours later the police found him with the gun at home, and arrested him and seized the gun. Subsequently they found and seized his automobile; it was still parked where he had left it, about nine blocks from his home.  Two months thereafter he validly sold the automobile to his father; and, seven months after the homicides, he was sentenced to 10 to 25 years in State prison, and there he is now confined. The conviction did not forfeit his property or deprive&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  him of the right to transfer his property; in any event, at the time of the sale he had not yet been sentenced (Penal Law, &sect; 510; now in Civil Rights Law, &sect; 79).  His father is entitled to judgment against the Police Department Property Clerk for the replevin of the automobile.  The Administrative Code of the City of New York (&sect; 435-4.0, subd. f) provides that a purchaser of property seized by the police must prove &quot;that such property or money was held and used in a lawful manner&quot;; but the circumstances of these homicides show that the automobile was only incidentally involved and that the criminal did not use the automobile to further those crimes.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a youthful offender, was charged with a felony. He executed a consent to be investigated for youthful offender treatment and, under protest, signed the jury waiver as required by N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 913-h.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that he had a right to a jury trial even as a youthful offender and challenged the constitutionality of N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 913-h that required that he waive a jury trial before being eligible for youthful offender treatment. Upon review, the court concluded that &sect; 913-h was not unconstitutional. The court determined that &sect; 913-h was a means for expression of the right to waive a jury trial as provided in N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The court ruled that, as no appellate court had extended the jury mandate provisions of U.S. Const. amend. VI to youthful offender proceedings in New York, the court was required to uphold the constitutionality of N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 913-h.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court disallowed defendant's protest and directed that defendant either waive a jury trial and stand for youthful offender treatment or proceed to trial as declining the offer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An 18-year-old youth was charged with a felony, and he executed a consent to be investigated and tried on a charge of being a youthful offender, but he signed under protest the jury trial waiver which is required by the Youthful Offender Act (Code Crim. Pro., &sect;&sect; 913-e-913-r).  The requirement of such waiver is constitutional (N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 2, which, unlike U. S. Const., 6th Amdt., provides for waiver).  The court disallows such signing under protest, and directs that the defendant shall either waive a trial by jury of the charge of being a youthful offender or shall proceed to a trial of the felony charge.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supplier provided a truck part to the seller, who then sold the part to the buyer. The buyer installed the part when repairing his truck, and suffered damages when the part proved to be defective. The buyer filed an action to recover damages from the seller. The seller filed a third-party action against the supplier. All of the parties were served with process and answers were timely filed. The supplier demanded a bill of particulars from the seller, and the seller demanded the same from the buyer. The seller and buyer complied with the requests. None of the parties made demands to resume prosecution pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3216(b) and no steps were taken to file a note of issue. The supplier and the seller filed motions to dismiss for general delay. The court found that neither the supplier nor the seller complied with N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3216(b) by demanding prosecution be resumed and that N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3216(b) was not an unconstitutional limit on a court's discretion to dismiss an action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested when they sought to protest the arrest and trial of four writers in the Soviet Union. The police restrained the protesters in a particular area, but the restraint was not observed. The police justified their order denying picketing before an embassy on the grounds that there was a security problem in protecting the embassy. The court concluded that defendants were not guilty of disorderly conduct for crossing into a closed area. The prohibition on the location of the picketing was not based on any policy established by the police department, and it was not contained in any ordinance or statute. Therefore, the court concluded that the police lacked the authority to close the public street in front of the embassy. As a result, the charges of disorderly conduct were invalid. Defendants had a right to exercise their First Amendment rights. For the same reason, the charge of resisting arrest with respect to one defendant was also invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was asked by the New York State Department of Labor to come to its office for an interview. There, defendant met with two Department agents and verified that signatures were his. He was then told that he was in trouble because the agents had obtained a statement from his employer that he was employed while he was collecting unemployment benefits. Defendant made three written statements. He was not given Miranda warnings. The court first stated that the agents were similar to employees of the Internal Revenue Service, to whom the United States Supreme Court had held the Miranda rule applied. The court held, however, that the Miranda warnings were not required because defendant was not in custodial interrogation. Defendant had frequently been in the Department's office, though not in the manager's office where the interview took place. The agents were not armed, and the office was drab but not prisonlike in appearance. Any fear defendant felt arose from his fear of unpleasant consequences rather than from external physical circumstances or from any intimidation. Moreover, the investigation had not reached such a critical stage as to mandate the presence of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an eminent domain proceeding, the law required the city to pay the interest rate of four percent under N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 3-a, and the claimants sought six percent. The court awarded the claimants an interest rate of six percent because four percent was so unreasonably low as to deprive the claimants just compensation and &quot;substantial justice&quot; would not have been fulfilled by the unrealistic and outmoded rate. The court also held that amending N.Y. State Fin. Law &sect; 16 to provide for six percent interest on condemnation awards while leaving the municipal rate at four percent as the legislature had done represented an unreasonable and palpably improper classification and constituted a denial to the claimants of the constitutional right to equal treatment of the laws.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a condemnation proceeding, interest is an integral part of the constitutional &quot;just compensation&quot; which the condemnor must pay and a matter for judicial determination despite section 3-a of the General Municipal Law which specifies a rate of 4% to be paid by municipal corporations on awards in condemnation proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Interest at the rate of 4% is unreasonably low and deprives claimants of &quot;just compensation&quot; in view of the high interest rates now prevailing.  Moreover, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  city earns 5.45% on its investments and it is to its profits to pay 4% interest on condemnation awards.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff old school board in one of two districts that were merged to form a new school district asked for a declaratory judgment against defendants, the new school board and its members. The old board asked that the new board be declared without power to act officially until at least the next school year, alleging that members of the new board were acting beyond their authority by acting as a board. Defendants filed a motion for dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The only interference the old board alleged resulted from the new board's activities preparing for the school year and from the publicity given these activities. The court noted that the old school district was about to go out of existence, and the new board had to assume additional burdens placed on it by law within a short time, providing for all the students in the area. The court explained that district was organized by an election, and the board members were elected at a school meeting. The court concluded that under N.Y. Educ. Law art. 37, the new school district came into existence the instant the New York Commissioner of Education issued an order creating it, and the district was organized when the voters approved it. The court noted other litigation between the same parties. The court concurred in the ruling of the Commissioner that any attempt by the old board to provide for the schools after the end of the current school year was ultra vires and void. The court ruled that the new board acted within its statutory powers by making plans for the new school year, negotiating wage contracts, preparing to and raising funds by a bond referendum, and incurring obligations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the motion to dismiss the complaint.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- central school districts -- action by merged union free school district for declaratory judgment against new central school district board's activities in negotiating wage contracts for forthcoming school year and conducting bond referendum, dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commissioner of Education merged two union free school districts into a new central school district in July, 1967; and the voters of both districts approved this in August, 1967, and in September, 1967 they elected a central school board, which will be in sole charge when the new school year begins on July 1, 1968 (Education Law, art. 37).  Meantime, the old union free school district boards have the duty of administering their schools and then winding up their accounts and transferring their funds and their bills to the new central school board by the end of July, 1968; and, meantime, the new central school board has the duty of preparing for July 1, 1968, and the power of negotiating wage contracts for the new year with the employees of the existing union free school districts, levying taxes in the present year for the coming year and for paying&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the remaining obligations of the union free school districts, issuing tax anticipation notes, conducting a bond referendum, etc. (Education Law, &sect; 1804, subds, 5, 6; &sect; 1805; Local Finance Law, &sect; 24.00, subd. d, par. 1.) No constitutional issues are involved in this, and if there are any such issues, they can be asserted by the voters and bondholders and others but not by the outgoing boards.  Accordingly, this complaint by one of the outgoing union free school district boards, seeking a declaratory judgment against the activities of the central school district board, is dismissed.  Moreover, these issues have already been determined against this board in an article 78 proceeding and in its suit to invalidate the election of the central school board; and it should pursue any appeal therefrom rather than institute this new suit; or, it should submit its disputes to the administrative procedures and remedies within the competence of the State Department of Education.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a national association of harness drivers, sought an order enjoining and restraining defendant, the New York State Racing Commission, during the pendency of the action from paying out and distributing in purses for races run at the thoroughbred race tracks an extra one half percent of the &quot;handle.&quot; The association's complaint and motion for an injunction pendente lite challenged the constitutionality of 1968 N.Y. Laws &sect;&sect; 3, 4, 8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1968 N.Y. Laws &sect;&sect; 3, 4, 8 permitted flat tracks and harness tracks to retain an additional percent of the total revenue of the pari-mutuel betting pool and permitted one half of that sum to be used for general corporate purposes. It required harness tracks to pay the other one half percent to the State as a tax. Flat tracks were permitted to retain the one half percent if the moneys were used for purse enrichment. The association contended that the statute was unconstitutional because no similar provision was made for harness tracks and because there was no rational basis for the distinction in treatment between the flat tracks and the harness tracks, or between the owners and drivers of thoroughbred horses and those of harness racing horses. The court dismissed the complaint. The court of appeals had previously upheld the constitutionality of a state statute permitting higher local admission taxes at harness tracks than at flat tracks, recognizing that the legislature was allowed to constitutionally distinguish between the tracks for the purpose of taxation. There was a &quot;rational basis&quot; for placing the two sports, for purposes of control and taxation, in different classifications.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a rational basis for legislation differentiating between horse racing at so-called &quot;flat tracks&quot; and horse racing at so-called &quot;harness tracks&quot;, as to controls and taxation. Thus, recent legislation (L. 1968, ch. 91) validly and constitutionally permits &quot;flat tracks&quot;, as distinguished from &quot;harness tracks&quot;, to use 1/2% of the so-called &quot;handle&quot; for the purpose of increasing purses. Moreover, the plaintiffs, representing harness horse racing drivers, have failed to demonstrate that they are personally aggrieved by this statute.  Their action for a declaration of unconstitutionality and for an injunction is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner law firm requested that the settling of the accounts of respondent executrix be postponed until a later date and asserted that N.Y. Surr. Ct. Proc. Act Law &sect; 2218 was unconstitutional on its face if it were applied to withhold funds from the beneficiary, the firm's alleged client.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the petition and account were first filed on behalf of the estate, a citation was issued to the firm's alleged client, a residual beneficiary living out of the country. The accounting clerk received an acknowledgment from the beneficiary, which also expressed opposition to the accountant's personal claim. No verified objections were filed by the beneficiary or an attorney on his behalf, and the court allowed the accountant's claim. Approximately six months later the law firm filed an appearance on behalf of the foreign consulate, claiming that the beneficiary was attempting to obtain a visa to travel to receive his payment; thus the proceedings were held in limbo. The law firm claimed that the beneficiary was executing a power of attorney, but none had been received. The court held that &sect; 2218 was constitutional and in order to serve its purpose of protecting beneficiaries, the court ordered the final accounts settled and the money paid into the court for the benefit of the beneficiary until either he claimed it or another was found authorized to claim it on his behalf.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the executor's final accounting for the settlement of the estate and held that the money that the beneficiary may have been entitled to was to be paid into the court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proceedings thus far had in this estate indicate that it is &quot;uncertain&quot; that a nephew who is a residuary beneficiary and who resides in the U.S.S.R. would have the benefit or use or control of the money due him; and therefore the final decree which will now be entered, settling the executrix' accounts, will direct that the share of said Soviet national shall be paid into court for his benefit or for the benefit of the person or persons who may hereafter be shown to be entitled thereto (SCPA 2218).  The cited statute has heretofore been held to be constitutional.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A clerk of the court issued the summons in a proceeding to determine if the juvenile was delinquent. The juvenile filed a motion to dismiss the summons, petition, and all proceedings therein, upon the ground that the summons and petition were not issued in compliance with the N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 736. Specifically, the juvenile alleged that his due process rights under the State and Federal Constitutions were violated because a judge had not found that probable cause existed prior to the issuance of the summons. The court denied the juvenile's motion and concluded that his due process rights were not violated. The court found that N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 736 did not require that a judge issue the summons. The court determined that the legislature had not intended to burden family court judges with the unnecessary duty to examine each petition in each new neglect, support, family offense, juvenile delinquent and persons in need of supervision proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the information against them on the ground that the city ordinance under which they were arrested was unconstitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested pursuant to a city ordinance that granted the mayor the authority to proclaim a state of emergency and invoke a curfew forbidding people to be present in public places during certain hours of the day. Defendants claimed that the ordinance was unconstitutional on its face in that (1) it was an unlawful delegation of legislative authority from the city council to the mayor, (2) the city had tried to legislate in an area which had been fully pre-empted by state law, (3) it denied defendants their constitutionally guaranteed liberties, and (4) it was overreaching and excessively broad and was susceptible to arbitrary enforcement in violation of defendants' constitutional rights. In dismissing the information, the court held that the portions of the ordinance having to do with firearms, curfew, and penalties were invalid in their entirety. However, because the ordinance contained a separability clause, the remainder of the ordinance was declared valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the motions to dismiss of defendants and dismissed the information against them on the ground that the city ordinance under which they were arrested was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- curfew -- ordinance purporting to authorize Mayor to proclaim emergency curfews invalid -- other parts of ordinance may be separable and valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A city ordinance purporting to authorize the Mayor to proclaim Emergency curfews during which &quot;No person shall enter or remain in any public street, park, square * * * in any such part or parts of the city during the hours of the day as may be prescribed by the Mayor&quot;, is excessively broad and hence peculiarly susceptible to arbitrary enforcement in violation of individual rights which are guaranteed by the Federal and State Constitutions.  Moreover, though its subject matter is not pre-empted by the Penal Law (art. 188, &quot;Riots and Unlawful Assemblies&quot;) and by the Code of Criminal Procedure (&sect; 102 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., &quot;Prevention and Suppression of Riots&quot;) the ordinance contravenes the Vehicle and Traffic Law ( &sect; 1604, &quot;Local ordinances prohibited&quot;).  Furthermore, the penalties specified in the ordinance -- fines of from $ 25 to $ 500, or imprisonment of up to 180 days, or both -- exceed the limits prescribed by the Second Class Cities Law ( &sect; 42) and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the city's charter (which is itself a local law; Local Laws, 1960, No. 13 of City of Syracuse, &sect; 8-118), both of which statutes authorize ordinances prescribing fines not exceeding $ 150 or imprisonment not exceeding 150 days or both.  This prohibitive ordinance is not authorized by the State Constitution (art. IX) or by the General City Law ( &sect; 20, subds. 13, 22) or by the Municipal Home Rule Law ( &sect; 10).  Accordingly, informations charging each of three defendants with separately entering or remaining on public streets after the emergency curfew hours which had been proclaimed by the Mayor are dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. However, there are other parts of this ordinance which are not involved in this case and which may be separable and valid, particularly so since this ordinance contains a provision for separability in case of partial invalidity. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county challenged a rate increase approved by the authority for one of its subsidiaries. The court dismissed the petition. The court held that although the county did not have standing to bring the action as an aggrieved party, under N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law &sect; 109, it had the right to bring the action. The crux of the county's argument was that the authority could not act as both petitioner for the rate increase and the trier of the facts. However, N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 1266(3) allowed the authority to levy such fares as it deemed necessary, convenient, or desirable. Because the hearing was quasi-legislative, disagreement with the authority's conclusion was no ground for finding it illegal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is an autonomous, semi-legislative body.  It is empowered to establish or raise fares, including those of its wholly owned subsidiary, the Long Island Rail Road Company, &quot;as it may deem necessary, convenient or desirable * * * only after a public hearing&quot; (Public Authorities Law, &sect; 1266, subd. 3).  Such a hearing is not subject to the usual requirements of quasi-judicial hearings; rather, it is a quasi-legislative hearing and is held for the Authority's own information.  In any event, the hearing met constitutional requirements, and the Authority's decision to raise the railroad's rates was not arbitrary or capricious or abusive of its discretion.  Accordingly, this review&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  petition ( CPLR, art. 78) is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Even if this should have been an &quot;action&quot; instead of an article 78 &quot;proceeding&quot;, the court has jurisdiction ( CPLR 103).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The County of Nassau is a proper petitioner or party (Public Service Law, &sect; 109; cf. Public Authorities Law, &sect; 1266, subd. 8).</SPAN></P>

However, defendants in this case did not assert a claim of discrimination, and the court did not find any indication in the record of discriminatory or unequal application of the ordinance.

Law &sect; 1220(a) for throwing refuse on a public highway. Defendant claimed that as to him the statute, because of the penalties prescribed by the Vehicle and Traffic Law and mandated by it, violated the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.Y. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The provisions of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf.

In all cases arising out of a conviction of any section of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 514(3) mandated that the conviction had to have been indorsed on the license, enabling a magistrate, in the future, to have knowledge of the former conviction. That brought into effect and made mandatory an extra and more severe penalty prescribed by &sect; 1800 in the case of a licensee, as opposed to one that did not have a driver's license. The court dismissed the charge and discharged defendant. The court found that because of the different forms of treatment afforded violators of &sect; 1220 and the unnatural classifications of violators and penalties to be imposed for such transgressions, &sect; 1220 violated the rights and privileges afforded persons under both the United States Constitution and the Constitution of New York State.</SPAN></P>

But holders of operator's licenses are subjected to additional penalties ( Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect;&sect; 510, 514) which are inapplicable to, or seem to be administratively unenforcible against, nonlicensed persons.  Moreover, licensed or unlicensed, a person who is under 18 and who lives with his parent or guardian is visited with a penalty which is not inflicted upon one who does not reside with his parent or guardian ( Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 514; Code Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord's petition to reverse the determination, which denied its protests regarding the parcels, was based on the contention that neither the state legislature nor the city council could have constitutionally imposed rent control on the parcels of land. The court found that New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; Y51-1.0 was enacted to deal with the emergency living needs created by war and the effects and aftermath of war hostilities. The court held that it was not to substitute its judgment for that of the City Council where there were facts that supported the legislature's decision to act. The court rejected the landlord's contention that if the parcels could have constitutionally been placed under control, they were subject to decontrol pursuant to Rent, Eviction, and Rehabilitation Regulations, &sect; 2(e)(2)(i)(4) and (f)(12). The court concluded that the Administrator correctly ruled that the &quot;housing accommodations&quot; involved were not subject to decontrol under the regulations because they authorized decontrol only of &quot;one or two-family houses&quot; and not of the land under the houses, which land was the &quot;housing accommodation&quot; subject to control.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Rent control laws validly and constitutionally cover &quot;any plot or parcel of land (as distinguished from any building constructed or placed thereon) * * * which was rented prior to&quot; May 1, 1950 &quot;for the purpose of permitting the tenant thereof to construct his own private dwelling * * * thereon and on which there exists such a private dwelling owned and occupied by a tenant of such plot or parcel&quot; (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; Y51-3.0, subd. e, par. 1).  Accordingly, the New York City Rent and Rehabilitation Administrator properly fixed a maximum rent of approximately&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  $ 25 a month for each of 250 parcels of such land on each of which the tenant thereof had erected his own one-family bungalow which cost him as much as or more than the value of the land.  Each of said bungalows had become vacant on or after October 1, 1953 and had thereafter been purchased by the present tenant of said parcel. The statute provides for decontrol of &quot;Housing accommodations in one or two family houses which were or shall become vacant on or after&quot; April 1, 1953 (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; Y51-3.0, subd. e, par. 2, subpar.

These statutes do not invidiously discriminate against landlords of such parcels. If the rents of such parcels of land were decontrolled, many of the tenants would have to sell or dispose of their bungalows at substantial sacrifices, since the landlords would be able to exact&quot; unjust, unreasonable and oppressive rents&quot; contrary to the legislative intent (L.  1962, ch. 21, &sect; 1, subd. 2; Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; Y51-1.0, subd. a).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorcycle rider was charged with violating N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 381(6) for riding his motorcycle without wearing a helmet. The trial court dismissed the charge and held the statute unconstitutional. The State sought review, and the court reversed. The court held that the statute was validly enacted for a legitimate purpose and did not unduly restrict the rider's rights. The court stated that a determination of the law's validity depended on whether the State was entitled to regulate the proscribed conduct under its police power. The court defined the State's police power as the means by which the State exercised supervision over matters regarding the common welfare and enforced the observance by each member of society of the duties he or she owed to others and to the community at large. The court found that &sect; 381(6) was enacted as the result of an extensive study of accidents involving motorcycles and the number of head injuries that resulted. The court held that the challenged legislation represented a valid purpose of legislative action under the State's police power. The court also held that the means used to accomplish that purpose were reasonable and not oppressive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's local gun control law provided that a permit and registration was required for a rifle or a shotgun. It enumerated those to whom the issuance of a permit would not be in the interest of public health, safety, or welfare. The gun owners sued to have the law declared unconstitutional and to permanently enjoin its enforcement. The court granted the city's motion for summary judgment. The court held that the gun owners did not meet their burden of demonstrating unconstitutionality. The gun control law was reasonably related to an actual manifest evil, and represented a reasonable means for attempting to solve the problem. The gun owners did not demonstrate that the gun control law in any way exceeded the city's police power. The gun owners did not support their contention that the field of gun control was preempted by the state. The standards of the gun control law were not so vague and indefinite as to be unconstitutional; rather, the law set down an intelligible principle and standards. The gun control law was regulatory, not aimed at persons inherently suspect of criminal activities; thus, it was not violative of the constitutional privilege of self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Gun Control Law enacted by Local Law No. 106 of 1967 of the City of New York is constitutional.  By its terms, it does not deprive the average citizen of the use and enjoyment of rifles or shotguns. It provides that no person shall be denied a permit unless he falls within the disabilities of the law.  It promotes the public welfare and safety and falls within the police power.

In spite of his election, he could not have assumed his duties until he was permitted to take the oath by the Convention. After he took the oath, the Comptroller was notified that he was discharging his duties as a delegate, and it was then that he was entitled to be paid for services rendered.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates to the New York State Constitutional Convention of 1967 were elected in November, 1966.

Delegate Santangello had taken the oath of office, and he was properly seated and he performed his duties and he was properly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  paid.  After the Court of Appeals decision, the Convention passed a resolution asking the Governor to call a special election for delegate in the Thirty-third Senate District.

Defendants were distributing newspapers door to door at private residences. Neither fell within the exception to the ordinance. The court stated first that the New York Court of Appeals had held that similar ordinances did not violate New York law. Furthermore, the ordinance did not violate free speech or due process because nothing prevented defendants from hiring a village resident to distribute the newspaper, mailing the newspaper, or distributing the newspaper in public places in the village. The ordinance, the purpose of which was to protect residents from having their private property entered upon, merely set forth how distribution could be legally effectuated. As for defendants' contention that the ordinance violated equal protection, the limitations imposed were germane to the purpose of the legislation.

The limitations of the ordinance, applicable to nonresidents but not to residents of the village for six months or more, were germane to the purposes of the legislation and did not violate the equal protection of the laws provisions of the Federal and State Constitutions and the laws of the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Defendants' noncommercial venture would not differ from a commercial distribution with respect to the applicability of the ordinance since the purpose thereof was to protect village residents' persons and property from unauthorized entry into their private residences by those unknown in the community.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A voter asserted that members of the Board of Regents had violated his equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, when the board selected a regent. In reaching this decision, the board met under N.Y. Educ.

The voter asserted that the board improperly valuated the votes of those state representatives equally when it ought to have counted the votes of state senators more, as there were over two assemblymen for each senator. The court dismissed the voter's amended complaint for failure to state a cause of action and found that the principle of &quot;one man, one vote&quot;, was not relevant to this matter because regents were not the elected representatives of the voter. In its decision, the court noted that the Board of Regents was an administrative board pursuant to N.Y. Educ.

The tenant sought summary judgment dismissing the landlord's complaint and for judgment on his counterclaim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant had lived in the apartment since 1936. When the rent control legislation became effective, the tenant became a statutory tenant that enjoyed all the benefits and protections of the legislation provided that he did not default on his rent payments or otherwise violate a substantial obligation of his tenancy. The landlord contended that the rent control legislation was only applicable to tenants who were not wealthy. He claimed the statute was unconstitutional because it protected wealthy tenants. Upon review, the court found that the landlord failed to establish that the rent control law made the distinction between wealthy and nonwealthy tenants. Therefore, equal protection applied to all tenants who came within the bounds of controlled housing. If the landlord wished to have the rent control law amended, he needed to seek the amendment from the legislature. The court granted the tenant's motion to dismiss the landlord's complaint for failure to state a cause of action. It also dismissed the tenant's counterclaim for money damages because there was no justiciable cause of action set forth.</SPAN></P>

(c) to dismiss defendant's affirmative defenses of lack of personal or subject matter jurisdiction and the law that plaintiff relied upon in obtaining jurisdiction was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was a New York resident and she brought an action against defendant, a New Jersey resident, for personal injuries she sustained in a car accident that occurred in New Jersey. Plaintiff obtained an order of attachment under which a levy was made against the interest of defendant on the obligation of her insurer to indemnify her under an automobile liability policy it issued to her. Defendant initially moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction but withdrew the motion and served her answer. Upon review, the court found it had subject matter jurisdiction over the action. Plaintiff's rights were not prejudiced by defendant's withdrawal of her motion. Because the case was based upon in rem jurisdiction, defendant's appearance did not subject her to the jurisdiction of the court because she raised an objection to the court's personal jurisdiction in her answer through an affirmative defense. Only if defendant proceeded with a defense after asserting her objection to jurisdiction would she subject herself to the court's jurisdiction. Defendant's affirmative defense on the constitutionality of the statute under which plaintiff obtained jurisdiction was stricken.</SPAN></P>

The plan challenged by the instant motion was the fourth plan, which was approved by the court from a constitutional standpoint, but was overwhelmingly defeated by popular vote. By its motion, the League of Women Voters sought to vacate the court's judgment and asked the court to order a reapportionment on the basis of single-member districts, or, to fix a time limitation within which a valid plan shall be proposed by the Board of Supervisors. The court said that it would have been a usurpation of legislative function for it to hold that the Board had to be apportioned on the basis of single-member districts.

In addition, the court found that the regulations were invalid because they were not shown to have an adequate connection with the preservation of public health, safety, and welfare. The court determined that notices mailed to plaintiffs by an administrative agency were invalid because they failed to notify the person accused of wrongdoing of his wrongful act in clear and unmistakable language.

Accordingly, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in this action by plaintiff corporation to have these and other regulations applying to ophthalmic dispensers and optometrists declared unconstitutional, illegal and unenforcible, the court found that no reasonable basis existed for an absolute ban against window displays or advertising on the part of corporations employing optometrists and ophthalmic dispensers in the sale of eyeglasses, and, since these regulations were not shown to have adequate connection with preserving public health, safety and welfare, that their enforcement would deprive plaintiff of a property right in operating its business of dispensing eyeglasses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Moreover, an amendment to the &quot;Advertising&quot; regulation, promulgated during the trial of this action and allowing self-employed optometrists to display up to five signs, gave them a competitive advantage over plaintiff and similar corporate employers of optometrists who were denied this privilege.  Such regulations which aid one group against another without benefitting the general public are condemned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Furthermore, the Legislature, by granting in 1928 to corporations such as plaintiff the right to employ optometrists and ophthalmic dispensers (Education&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Law, &sect; 7109), by implication permitted such corporations to continue their business without interference so long as the public interests were protected, and these regulations not only interfere with the operation of a private business but also prevent the corporations from truthfully advising the public of their limited authority to examine their customers' eyes.  The statute (legislation to repeal which was sponsored by the Optometric Association but vetoed by the Governor in 1967) allowing plaintiff to hire optometrists and ophthalmic dispensers, should not be emasculated step by step by the Regents' promulgating regulations based on proposals by the Optometric Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Those parts of the Commissioner's Regulations which prohibit licensed optometrists (8 NYCRR 66.1 [a] [12] before amdt. of May 26, 1967) and ophthalmic dispensers (8 NYCRR 67.1 [a] [5]) from continuing employment after receiving written notice from the Department that their employer is violating those regulations relating to conduct or avertising, are likewise illegal and unenforcible and such departmental notices served thereunder upon optometrists and ophthalmic dispensers employed by plaintiff corporation, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  threatening them with disciplinary action and possible license revocation, are declared null and void.  The Department here notified the optometrists that plaintiff had advertised in conflict with 8 separate paragraphs of the applicable regulations whereas there was actually only one such paragraph possibly violated.  Likewise, the Department's notice to the ophthalmic dispensers charged that plaintiff's advertising violated 4 separate paragraphs of the regulations whereas no such violations had occurred.  Such notices violated the fundamental legal principle that an accused person would be informed of the wrongful act charged in clear and unmistakable language without being obliged to conjecture as to the charge.  &quot;Shotgun&quot; charges should not be leveled by anyone in authority against a professional man who should not have to determine whether he must leave his employment or continue thereat with the possibility of suspension of his license.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. However, the Department on May 26, 1967, after this action was commenced, amended one of the regulations (8 NYCRR 66.1 [a] [12]) and since the amendment provides for a statement of the specific violations alleged on the part of the employer&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and fixes a date for a preliminary hearing with the right to be represented by counsel, the illegality of the original regulation has been corrected and, therefore, it is now valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. With respect to plaintiff's contention that regulations governing &quot;Price Advertising&quot; (8 NYCRR 67.1 [a] [3]) and &quot;Advertising Gratutitous Services&quot; (8 NYCRR 67.1 [a] [4]) and applicable to ophthalmic dispensers, are also illegal and unenforcible, the court declined to pass on the legality of these regulations since no convincing proof was offered that plaintiff corporation engaged in either activity at the time the regulations were promulgated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The court recommends that the Legislature or the Education Department should bring together at a hearing all parties interested in eye care in order to resolve existing animosities, to enact corrective legislation and regulations to overcome the shocking disdain shown for public needs, and to provide for the establishment of a School of Optometry within this State which at present has no such institution.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner wife sought to transfer a proceeding back to a court of criminal jurisdiction pursuant to N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 816(a); respondent husband was accused of felonious assault of the wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that a proceeding involving truly criminal conduct should be transferred from the Family Court to a criminal court. The court also noted that a reconciliation between the parties seemed improbable. The court's difficulty in estimating whether husband was dangerous to his wife or the community was intensified by the lack of a psychiatric evaluation. The husband had no criminal record, and the wife's testimony and manner at the hearing indicated more a desire for vengeance than a fear of her husband. The court found that the retention of the proceeding would not help the family in some fundamental respects and that the husband could be dangerous, and noted that a societal interest in criminal prosecution for an extremely grave assault. The court also noted that the husband would not in any event be spared the detriment of criminal processes as he was subject to trial on a weapons charge regardless of whether the court retained jurisdiction over the assaultive acts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proceeding was transferred to the Criminal Court of New York City.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Family Court -- jurisdiction of crimes -- indictment against husband for assault and attempted murder of his wife is void, since complaint to Criminal Court of assault between members of family must first be transferred to Family Court -- but indictment is valid as to portion which alleges unlawful possession of weapon -- Family Court determines that its own processes are &quot;inappropriate&quot; in this particular case, and hence transfers proceeding back to New York City Criminal Court (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Family Ct. Act, &sect;&sect; 811</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">816</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">821</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) -- court suggests that Family Court Act be amended so as to provide that alleged offender's statements and testimony in such transfer hearing or proceeding in Family Court shall not be admissible in any criminal prosecution against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A husband shot and wounded his wife, after she had gone to live with their married child and for six weeks had repeatedly rebuffed his attempts at reconciliation. He was arraigned in the New York City Criminal Court on a charge of felonious assault. Subsequently he was indicted by a Grand Jury for attempted first degree murder, first degree assault, and unlawful possession of a firearm. Since the Family Court has original&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  jurisdiction of assaults and family offenses, and since the indictment was obtained without first obtaining an order of the Family Court determining &quot;that the processes of the family court are inappropriate&quot; (Family Ct. Act, &sect; 816 [formerly numbered 814], subd. [a]) the indictment is void as to the alleged assault and attempted murder ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">People </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Johnson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 20 N Y 2d 220, followed).  However, the indictment is valid as to the firearms count.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. After the indictment was obtained, the criminal proceeding was transferred to the Family Court.  The latter has conducted a hearing, and has determined that its retention of jurisdiction would not fundamentally help this family, that this husband is possibly dangerous to the safety of his wife and of the public, that there is a societal or public interest in criminally prosecuting this crime, that anyway this husband is subject to criminal prosecution on a weapons charge, and that, in this particular case &quot;the processes of the family court are inappropriate&quot; (Family Ct. Act, &sect; 816, subd. [a]; &sect; 811; see, also, &sect;&sect; 812-817; &sect;&sect; 821, 822, 842, 845, 846; Family Ct. Rules, rule 8.3); and accordingly the Family Court now transfers this&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  proceeding back to the New York City Criminal Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In view of the alleged offender's constitutional privilege against making any admissions on direct examination which might incriminate him or which might open the door to an incriminating cross-examination, and in view of his privilege of keeping his communications with physicians confidential, and in view of the requirements of due process, the Family Court is inhibited, under the present statute governing such a hearing as this, from compelling important testimony and unsworn statements and a psychiatric examination, and the alleged offender is similarly inhibited from talking freely in court and in chambers and in conference.  Accordingly, the court suggests that the Legislature amend the Family Court Act so as to provide expressly that the alleged offender's testimony and statements in such a hearing or proceeding shall not be admissible in any criminal prosecution against him (cf. Family Ct. Act, &sect; 824, and Code Crim. Pro., &sect;&sect; 312-d, 913-i).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a membership corporation representing builders and the members of the corporation, brought an action against defendants, the Town Board of the Town of Ramapo and others. Plaintiffs sought an injunction pendente lite restraining the Town from enforcing Town of Ramapo, N.Y., Local Law No. 4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were engaged in constructing single-family dwellings. The ordinance provided that when such a house was to be erected, the down payment would be held in escrow. The court stated that a local government had only derived powers as created either by the New York Constitution or its legislature. Here, neither the constitution nor statutes had conferred the power to enact such an ordinance upon the town. Furthermore, the town could not impinge upon freedom of contract. The lawful and permissible solution to its concern about protecting homebuyers was to ensure compliance with its building code, not to create, through its own legislation, a fund against which a homeowner could proceed to recoup damages. The court rejected defendants' argument that another town had adopted a similar ordinance. The other town's ordinance was not necessarily valid. Finally, the court stated that although the ordinance had a separability clause, the clause was of no avail because the legislation was so replete with unconstitutional provisions that its basic purpose could not be salvaged.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- local laws -- towns cannot constitutionally require builders to deposit purchasers' down payments in escrow for benefit of those purchasers who might institute suits arising out of defects in workmanship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A town's local law began with a section headed &quot;Legislative Intent&quot;, which stated that &quot;The Town Board * * *, deeming it necessary to take adequate steps to protect purchasers of newly-constructed homes * * * and further insure that said homes have been built in accordance with * * * regulations and laws, and in a good and workmanlike manner, hereby determines that the enactment of this local law, pursuant to the powers granted by the Municipal Home Rule Law and the Town Law of the State of New York, will contribute to the public welfare and * * * the orderly development of the Town * * * and to the protection of future home buyers in the Town&quot;.  The other sections (a) required that, when a builder of one-family or two-family homes contracted to sell a home, the &quot;down payment shall be held in escrow by the attorney for either the seller or purchaser, or * * * a title company * * * or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * * * the Town Clerk&quot;, but, if a building permit had already been issued, then such down payment must &quot;be deposited in escrow with the Building Inspector&quot;, and (b) empowered the Justice Court of the town to entertain any action brought within one year arising out of any defect in construction or workmanship of such a home.  At the end of this local law was a separability clause in the event of partial invalidity. However, the entire local law is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. No such power as this, over private contracts, has been delegated to the towns by Constitution or statute, even if the State itself were to be deemed to have such power.  A temporary injunction shall issue against any enforcement of this local law. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An indictment charged 17 defendants with the crimes of advocacy of criminal anarchy (count one), conspiracy to commit the crime of criminal anarchy (count four), conspiracy to commit the crime of arson in the third degree (count five), and other substantive crimes. Thirteen defendants interposed demurrers to discrete counts of the indictment by which they were respectively charged with various crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Six defendants demurred to the first and fourth counts of the indictment on grounds that the facts stated therein did not constitute a crime and the indictment did not conform with the requirements of N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect;&sect; 275, 276, 278, 279. Three defendants also demurred to the fifth count of the indictment on the same grounds. Five defendants demurred to the respective substantive counts charging each with possession of firearms on the ground that the indictment as to those counts violated N.Y. Code Crim.

The court sustained the demurrers to the first, fourth, and fifth counts of the indictment, primarily because those counts merely reiterated statutory language and contained no particulars concerning the crimes charged.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- criminal anarchy -- indictment of advocacy of criminal anarchy (Penal Law, &sect; 161) must sufficiently allege defendants' intent to overthrow government of State of New York, nature of violence they advocated, identity of any books or papers or printed matter, and existence of clear and present danger; free speech is constitutionally protected, and Federal Government has pre-empted crime of advocating overthrow of Federal Government -- indictment charging conspiracy to advocate criminal anarchy likewise insufficient, despite allegation of nine overt acts (Code Crim Pro., &sect;&sect; 275, 276) -- indictment charging conspiracy to commit arson and setting forth four overt acts, insufficient for failing to identify structures or vehicles to be burnt -- accordingly, demurrers to above 3 counts of 17-count indictment sustained -- District Attorney may resubmit these matters to Grand Jury -- other substantive, connected crimes are properly alleged in separate counts in one indictment (Code Crim. Pro., &sect;&sect; 278, 279).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An indictment charging advocacy of criminal anarchy (Penal Law, &sect; 161) must allege more than advocacy by speech, since free speech is constitutionally protected.  The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  indictment must allege, further, that the defendants intend to accomplish the overthrow of the government of the State of New York by violence or other unlawful means and that a clear and present danger exists that such advocated overthrow will be attempted or accomplished.  The crime of advocating overthrow of the Federal Government has been pre-empted by the Federal Government (U. S. Code, tit. 18, &sect; 2385); and section 161 of our Penal Law does not make it a crime to advocate the violent overthrow of the government of a sister State or of a foreign nation.  Further, the indictment must specify the form which the advocacy or teaching or advice took, to whom it was directed, the nature of the violence which was advocated or taught, the officials if any who were to be assassinated, and whatever other acts constituted defendants' crime (Code Crim. Pro., &sect;&sect; 275, 276), and, moreover, it must identify any papers, documents, books or written or printed matter allegedly advocating such force or violence or other unlawful means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An indictment charging conspiracy to commit the crime of advocacy of criminal anarchy must likewise sufficiently allege the form and the overt acts which the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  conspiracy took.  Although nine overt acts are set forth in the indictment in this case, they do not sufficiently identify the conspiracy charged so as to inform the defendants of the acts constituting their crime (Code Crim. Pro., &sect;&sect; 275, 276), to the end that a defense may be prepared and a subsequent charge for the same crime prevented, particularly so since a charge of conspiracy can be sustained by proof of commission of overt acts other than those alleged in the indictment so long as one of the alleged overt acts is proved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. An indictment charging conspiracy to commit the crime of arson, and setting forth four overt acts, is likewise insufficient, for failure to identify the arsons and the particular structures or vehicles intended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Therefore, demurrers to the foregoing 3 counts of a 17-count indictment are sustained (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 323, subds. 2, 4), with leave to the District Attorney to resubmit the matters to the same or another Grand Jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The indictment properly alleges, in separate counts, other separate substantive crimes which were connected together or were parts of a common plan (Code Crim. Pro., &sect;&sect; 278, 279; &sect; 323, subd. 3).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants contended that the grand jury was unconstitutionally selected and that the provisions of N.Y. Jud. Law &sect;&sect; 596, 609, 662, 684(1) were unconstitutional because the eligibility provisions required a juror to be intelligent, of sound mind, and good character, well informed, and a person who had not been convicted of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude and that such provisions set up an impermissible subjective test for juror qualification to be applied by the jury clerk. Defendants contended that the jury clerk in applying the subjective test was or might have been influenced by prejudice. Defendants further contended that most grand juries in the county consisted mostly of white people and that blacks received token representation on such bodies. The court denied the motion finding that defendants failed to make any factual showing sufficient to raise an issue that there was a deliberate and systematic exclusion of blacks from service on grand juries. The court found that defendants merely presented undocumented, unsupported conclusions and inferences, and the absence of proof of members of an eligible class or race from a particular jury or panel was not proof.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grand jury -- selection -- no proof that County Clerk discriminates against Negroes in selecting grand jurors who are &quot;intelligent; of sound mind and good character; well informed&quot;; further requirement, that they shall not have been convicted of misdemeanor &quot;involving moral turpitude&quot;, has been interpreted by courts; motion to dismiss indictment denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Judiciary Law ( &sect; 596; see, also, &sect;&sect; 609, 662) directs and empowers the County Clerk to select grand jurors who, among other qualifications, are &quot;intelligent; of sound mind and good character; well informed&quot;, and who have not been convicted of &quot;a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude.&quot; The last-quoted words have been interpreted in a number of judicial decisions; and the other quoted requirements are not so subjective as to give license to a County Clerk to discriminate unconstitutionally against Negroes and low-income groups.  The defendants in this case who move to dismiss these indictments of conspiracy to commit criminal anarchy and conspiracy to commit murder are seven Negroes, and their counsel asserts in his brief that, although Negroes comprise one sixth&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the population of this county, only occasionally is a &quot;token&quot; Negro selected to serve on a Grand Jury; but this assertion is not documented or factually supported.  Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has ruled that the constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection do not require that a jury panel contain the same political or economic or racial or religious or national-origin proportions as does the population of the county.  Accordingly, these indictments will not be dismissed on the ground asserted by defendants' counsel.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being struck by a train, the injured party filed a personal injury action against he railroad entity involved. The railroad entity asserted a defense based on the injured party's failure to comply with statutory notice requirements. The injured party filed a motion for leave to file a notice of claim and for leave to amend his complaint to allege proper notice or, alternatively, for a declaration that the notice requirements were met. The court granted the motion in all respects and ordered that the railroad entity was estopped from asserting the notice defense. The court found that the 90-day notice requirement resulted from a &quot;quiet&quot; amendment to the statute, and the bar and litigants were not adequately notified of the amendment. The court concluded that because no rational relationship existed between the statute and any public policy, such a short limitation period was unconstitutional unless the court had discretion to relieve a party from nonprejudicial mistake or inadvertence under N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff was severely injured in an accident on June 30, 1967 by the alleged tort of the Long Island Rail Road.  Within a few days after the accident, while plaintiff was undergoing a double amputation in the hospital, the railroad's insurer interviewed witnesses and plaintiff's wife.  Counsel was retained by plaintiff on July 7, 1967 and he immediately wrote to the railroad's insurer, notifying it of the accident.  On September 26, 1967, which was less than 90 days after the accident, this action was commenced by service of summons and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  complaint on the railroad. Plaintiff is granted leave to file a late notice of claim (General Municipal Law, &sect; 50-e; CPLR 2004) and to amend the complaint, 30 days after such filing, so as to allege that 30 days have elapsed since the notice of claim was served (Public Authorities Law, &sect; 1276, subd. 1).  The order will also provide, in the alternative, that service of a notice of claim is dispensed with and that the complaint may, if necessary, be amended to provide the specifications of section 50-e (subd. 2) of the General Municipal Law, and for service of duplicate copies under subdivision 3 of said section 50-e.  The order will also provide that defendant is estopped from establishing its defense of no notice, and that such defense is stricken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority was originally created in 1965 and consisted at that time of two public authorities -- the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority and the New York City Transit Authority.  On January 20, 1966 it acquired the Long Island Rail Road Co., a private stock corporation, and thereafter subdivision 6 was added to section 1276 of the Public Authorities Law and provided that, commencing on January 20, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1967, the notice requirements of subdivisions 1 and 2 of said section 1276 of the Public Authorities Law and of section 50-e of the General Municipal Law should apply to &quot;a subsidiary corporation of the authority which is a stock corporation&quot;.  This was an omnibus bill; it contained many amendments and it did not specifically name the Long Island Rail Road Co. (cf. N. Y.  Const., art. III, &sect;&sect; 15, 16, 17).  Prior to this amendment, a plaintiff had three years in which to commence an action against this stock corporation ( CPLR 214).  This short-notice amendment might be unconstitutional if it were intended to deprive the courts of discretion to relieve an injured person from his nonprejudicial mistake.  Such discretion is set forth in general terms in CPLR 2004 and it should be construed to apply to subdivisions 1, 2 and 6 of section 1276 of the Public Authorities Law. On the facts of this case, the railroad is estopped from asserting any defense of lack of notice of claim, and such defense is stricken.  </SPAN></P>

The purchaser obtained the choses in action of some of the former owners. The purchaser and the remaining former owners filed a declaratory judgment action against the State, City and the lienor's assignee and the mortgagee. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the court granted summary judgment to defendants. The court ruled that the purchaser's claim was precluded by res judicata due to a prior action against defendants. The court held that the enactment of &sect; D17-25.0 gave adequate notice of the former owners' right to present a claim for purposes of due process. The court ruled that the former owners were not denied equal protection because &sect; D17-25.0 gave them a first right to apply for a reconveyance.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In rem tax lien foreclosure proceedings (Administrative Code of City of New York, ch. 17, tit. D) vest valid title in the city.  The statute's provisions have been held constitutional ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Nelson </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> City of New York</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 352 U.S. 103, followed).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An additional section has been enacted (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; D17-25.0) whereby a foreclosed-upon owner or mortgagee or other lienor may, upon his paying all taxes owed to the city and other costs, be granted a reconveyance of the property by the city.

Under said section D17-25.0 of the Administrative Code, a reconveyance to the former owner reinstates the former liens; whereas, for the same price, a reconveyance to a former lienor wipes out entirely the equity of the former owner, no matter how substantial that equity was.  In the interests of fairness and of constitutionality, the court suggests that the section be amended: (a) the former owner should be notified when a lienor applies for a reconveyance; (b) the four-month limitation and the two-month limitation on applications for reconveyances should be enlarged; and (c) the unjustifiable discrimination in favor of former lienors and against former owners of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  property should be obviated.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation notified the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) that it was establishing a heliport, which was accepted by the FAA. The corporation discontinued helicopter flights to and from its plant following communications from the village that directed it to do so on the ground that such operations were in violation of the village's building zone ordinance. The corporation brought a complaint for a declaratory judgment. The court dismissed the corporation's complaint. The court held that a place set aside for the landing and take-off of a helicopter was a heliport. The court found that the portion of the corporation's property was subject to the village ordinance. The court determined that the FAA only indicated its approval from an airspace standpoint, and it did not grant permission to establish a limited private helicopter landing area, therefore, the ordinance was not an unlawful attempt to legislate upon a matter pre-empted by the federal government. The court held that it could not be said that the village's determination to exclude heliports from the industrial district of the village did not promote the health, safety, morals, or the general welfare of the community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the center of a small village is a 40-acre industrially zoned plot, which is surrounded by many residences and by a school, a shopping center and a theatre.  The zoning ordinance forbids any &quot;Heliport&quot; in the industrial zone. In that industrial zone are plaintiff's factory, which covers 2 acres, and plaintiff's black-topped parking area, which covers 2 acres, and plaintiff's vacant parcel of 11 acres, and beyond plaintiff's property but within 1,100 feet of plaintiff's proposed heliport landing site are several fuel storage tanks.  Plaintiff wishes to use part of its paved parking area for the landing and take-off of its helicopter for the transportation about 10 times a month of important personnel, customers and distributors.  The Federal Aviation Agency has stated to plaintiff that such a &quot;private use heliport&quot; would be acceptable &quot;from an airspace standpoint&quot; but that plaintiff must apply to State and/or local authorities &quot;for license or approval * * * including request&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for local rezoning if needed.&quot; The village has properly refused to grant permission.  The Federal Aviation Agency publishes a &quot;Heliport Design Guide&quot; which defines a &quot;heliport&quot; as including an &quot;off-heliport landing site&quot;.  What plaintiff proposes is prohibited by the village zoning ordinance, and is not authorized or licensed by the FAA and is not exclusively regulated by Federal law.  Moreover, less than a mile from plaintiff's plant and readily accessible by good roads is a seaplane base which is suitable for helicopter landings and take-offs. The village is granted judgment declaring that its zoning ordinance validly and constitutionally prohibits plaintiff's proposed helicopter site. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attendance supervisor claimed that the children endangered the health and safety of other minors because their parents refused to have them immunized against poliomyelitis as required by N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2164. The parents argued that the exception to &sect; 2164 applied to them because they were bona fide members of a recognized religious organization whose teachings were contrary to the practice required in &sect; 2164. They also argued that &sect; 2164 violated N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV. The court held that N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2164 was a reasonable and proper exercise of the police power of the State, for the protection of the public health, within the ambit of constitutionally permissible legislative authority. The court further held that the record did not indicate that the parents' objections to immunization were based upon the tenets of a religious organization. Rather, the court believed that the parents were members of the Methodist Church, a recognized religious organization, whose teachings were not contrary to such immunization. Yet, the court dismissed the four N.Y. Educ. Law art. 65, pt. 1 proceedings for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 2164 of the Public Health Law which provides that no person in charge of a school shall permit any child to attend who does not have a certificate or other evidence of the child's immunization against poliomyelitis and which further provides that it does not apply to children whose parents are members of a religious organization whose teachings are contrary to the practice of immunization is a valid and constitutional exercise of the police power for the protection of the public health.</SPAN></P>

The parents of four children of school age have refused&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to have them immunized against poliomyelitis on the ground that it is against their religious beliefs.  The court finds that they are members of the Methodist Church, a recognized religious organization, whose teachings are not contrary to immunization and that their objections are based on their personal beliefs.  They do not qualify for the exemption contained in the section.  Accordingly, each of the four children is adjudged to be a neglected child within article 3 of the Family Court Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Family Court lacks jurisdiction of proceedings against the parents charging them with a violation of part 1 of article 65 of the Education Law. The Constitution does not give the court jurisdiction of such proceedings which are penal in nature because section 3233 of the Education Law provides penalties of imprisonment for violations thereof.  The proceedings are dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

An AFL-CIO union has filed objections with said board against such all-inclusive certification, as having been made without sufficient evidence and without an election.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated trial, defendants, two supermarkets, filed motions to dismiss the informations against them for selling shortweighted butter in violation of N.Y. Agric. Mkts. &sect; 189. Defendant two was also charged with not having a scale available to customers in violation of N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. &sect; 193(5).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inspectors checked over 35,000 pounds of butter and found more than 10 percent of them to be short weight. The State argued that a seller of foodstuffs was liable when a short-weight item is exposed and offered for sale to a consumer. The State urged that a lack of knowledge or intent on the part of the seller would not enable him to avoid conviction for violation of this nature. Defendants argued that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 189 required the State to plead and prove intent beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that the legislature did not intend and would not have intended to make &sect; 189 a statutory enclave in the Agriculture and Markets Law by constituting it the only section, which required intent to be pleaded and proven. The court further held that whether or not knowledge was to be imputed to defendants beyond a reasonable doubt was for the trial court to determine based upon the testimony and exhibits adduced during trial. The court found that such scienter was abundantly established by the State in this case. The court noted that the matter of falsity of weights was brought to defendants' attention and that they were given a reasonable opportunity to correct the problem.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- short-weight sale of food -- retail supermarkets were fined $ 200 for offering for sale one-pound packages of butter which weighed only about 15 3/4 ounces (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Agriculture and Markets Law, &sect; 189</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) -- intent and knowledge may be shown by circumstances; immaterial that supermarkets had purchased one-pound packages from wholesalers -- $ 100 fine imposed for not keeping scale &quot;easily available to customers&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Agriculture and Markets Law, &sect; 193</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 5).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Agriculture and Markets Law ( &sect; 41) makes it a misdemeanor to violate its provisions, and declares that its provisions &quot;should receive a liberal interpretation&quot; (&sect; 3), and that &quot;intent * * * is immaterial in any prosecution&quot; (&sect; 43).  Section 189 is entitled &quot;False labels&quot;, and prohibits any false indication of weight or measure &quot;with intent to defraud&quot;, and any sale or offering for sale of an article &quot;which to his knowledge&quot; is thus falsely labeled.  These provisions were originally in the Penal Law ( &sect; 435, subds. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1, 2); but, when they were transposed into the Agriculture and Markets Law ( &sect; 189) they were intended to be interpreted by the standards of the latter law.  Accordingly, &quot;intent&quot; and &quot;knowledge&quot; under section 189 can be proved by the circumstances, as under any other penal section of the Agriculture and Markets Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Two retail supermarket corporations are found by the court to be guilty beyond a reasonable doubt (Agriculture and Markets Law, &sect; 189) of offering for sale 343 packages of butter, each marked as weighing one pound, and which may have weighed one pound when wrapped and marked at the packer's plant or when stored in the warehouse of the wholesaler, but which, perhaps because of moisture shrinkage, weighed only about 15 3/4 ounces when sold or offered for sale to the ultimate consumer.  Each retail corporation is fined $ 200.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Agriculture and Markets Law ( &sect; 193, subd. 5) validly and constitutionally requires that &quot;Wherever food or food products are packaged or wrapped for sale by a retailer * * * an accurate computing scale shall be maintained so placed as to be easily available to customers.&quot; Such a scale must front to the public.  Furthermore, in a supermarket, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a scale which is 40 feet away from the dairy department is not &quot;easily available to customers&quot; in the dairy department.  For this violation, the court fines one supermarket $ 100.  </SPAN></P>

The court concluded that petitioner as a paroled prisoner was not regarded as a &quot;free man&quot; nor was he a prisoner.

Therefore, the returning of petitioner without extradition or without waiver thereof was proper because there was compliance with N.Y. Correct. Law &sect;&sect; 216-218.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were alleged to be engaged or about to engage in prostitution. For some defendants it was also alleged that upon inquiry by a police officer failed to give a reasonably credible account of their conduct and purposes. The informations were based upon observations of police officers in which they stated that they saw defendants, known or suspected prostitutes speak to two or three men while walking or standing on a public street. The officers did not overhear the conversations and did not know who the men were but they arrested defendants upon the ground that they were engaged or about to engage in prostitution. The court held that the &sect; 240.35 was also suspect on the ground that it was not sufficiently explicit to inform those who were subject to it what conduct on their part would render them liable to its penalties. The court found that it was the judgment of the officer and not the activity of a defendant, which constituted the crime. The court also found that the provision of &sect; 240.35, which required a defendant to explain herself was unconstitutional, because an accused may remain silent and no penal conclusions flowed from that silence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Informations charging defendants, all alleged to be prostitutes, with loitering under subdivision 6 of section 240.35 of the Penal Law are dismissed.  Such subdivision provides for arrests where the loitering is suspected to be preparatory to engaging in &quot;crime&quot;.  Under section 230.00 of the Penal Law prostitution is a &quot;violation&quot;. Since the loitering statute does not permit arrests for &quot;violations&quot;, defendants were improperly arrested. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owner and third-party defendant realty company filed a motion for summary judgment in the owner's action to determine a claim allegedly made by defendant village adverse to his title to certain land under the water of a bay. The village was also a third-party plaintiff. Other third-party defendants joined in the motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner placed barricades up on the wharf at issue, and the village forced the owner to remove them. The village contended that the granting of state land to the owner's predecessor via 1954 N.Y. Laws 335 was unconstitutional, such that the owner had not entitled meant to the land at issue. The court disagreed. The court found that although it was questionable that the village had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute, because it admitted to not having a right to the land but rather was defending the publics right to use said land, the court would determine the issue because the owner agreed that the issue should be resolved. The court determined that although the Commissioners of the Land Office were restricted by the Public Lands Law to grant state land only to adjacent proprietors, it was lawful for the State to make the grant to others than the adjacent proprietors for the public good. Unless positive proof to the contrary was offered, the court as bound by the strong presumption that a statute was validly enacted. Chapter 335 did not restrict the state's power to grant land, only the Commissioners, who were not responsible for the original grant of land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the transfer of title from the State as valid and a judgment was awarded against the village.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The State of New York owned the land under the waters of Greenport Harbor, adjoining the Village of Greenport, in Suffolk County, which harbor is part of Peconic Bay.  By a special act (L. 1954, ch. 335), the State validly and constitutionally authorized the Commissioners of the Land Office to convey -- and they did convey -- to the Greenport Wharf Company -- even though said grantee did not own the upland (cf. Public Lands Law, art. 6) -- the title to the land under the waters of said Greenport Harbor upon which the predecessors of said corporation, pursuant to earlier special legislative acts, had for many years built and maintained a dock or wharf. Pursuant to said earlier enactments, this special act provided that &quot;Such conveyance shall be subject to any public or private rights to a landing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the easterly portion of the premises to be conveyed hereunder and subject to the right of ingress and egress thereto.&quot; This is the only extent to which the village has any rights in said property.  There is no evidence that the village has ever acquired any prescriptive rights in said property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. If one of said earlier acts (L. 1926, ch. 45) was essential to the validity of the corporation's present title, and if said act required a two-thirds vote (cf. N. Y. Const., art. III, &sect;&sect; 17, 20, 23), the court will take notice that, though said act as published bears a headnote which recites &quot;Passed, three-fifths being present&quot;, actually it was passed by a vote of 138 to 0 in the Assembly, and by 40 out of a total membership of 51 in the Senate, which is far more than two thirds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Accordingly, summary judgment is granted to the successors in interest of said Greenport Wharf Company, determining that the village has no claim to said property.  </SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 564-15.0 et seq., and a resolution of respondent city's Board of Health under the city's Emergency Repair Program, declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the landlord's tenants discovered a stoppage in her toilet that caused it to overflow. The landlord refused to repair it, so the tenant reported it to the city. The toilet was repaired by a contractor hired by the city, which sought reimbursement from the landlord. The landlord claimed that the emergency repair program and the provisions of the administrative code upon which it was based worked a denial of equal protection of the laws, an unconstitutional impairment of his contractual rights, and a deprivation of property without due process. The resolution designated as public nuisances those dwellings lacking certain services such as running water, effective sewage disposal facilities, electricity, or heat. It ordered the immediate abatement of such nuisances by owners, and in the event they failed to do so, authorized the city to take the steps required to secure such abatement. The court dismissed the landlord's petition, holding that the statutes challenged were reasonably directed toward the correction of the problem of substandard housing and should not be set aside because the means devised to accomplish that result impaired the obligation of the landlord's contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- health nuisances in multiple dwellings -- public health nuisance, such as stopped toilet in apartment in multiple dwelling, may be repaired by contractor hired by city, on summary notice to landlord and without any judicial proceeding; city may then have lien on rents and may require landlord to repay city's expenses (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; 564-15.0 et seq.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A tenant in a multiple dwelling in New York City discovered a stoppage in her toilet which caused it to overflow. She notified the landlord. The landlord denies this, and asserts that the tenant herself willfully or negligently caused the stoppage and that in such case the lease does not require the landlord to repair the condition.  In any event, after four days the tenant reported the condition to the New York City Department of Buildings.  On that day, the department inspected the toilet and notified the landlord and the city's Department of Health; and the latter at once certified that this condition constituted a nuisance. On the next day, the Buildings Department hired a contractor, who repaired the toilet, for $ 58.10.  Subsequently, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Buildings Department lawfully obtained reimbursement from the landlord. Otherwise the city could have validly and constitutionally filed a lien on the building and all its rents (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; 564-15.0 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.) and declared the nuisance to be &quot;a rent impairing violation&quot; (Multiple Dwelling Law, &sect; 302-a) and accordingly could have notified all the tenants to pay their rents meanwhile to the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A municipality may abate a public health nuisance summarily and without any judicial proceeding, and may then properly require reimbursement from the property owner.  Pursuant to the Administrative Code of the City of New York (&sect; 564-15.0 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.), the city's Board of Health had passed a resolution providing for summary notice to a landlord when a nuisance presents an immediate danger to the life or health of the occupants of a building.  The Department of Buildings' manual of procedure for such emergency repairs sufficiently provides for such summary notice, and this landlord was properly given such notice. These provisions are valid and constitutional.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant testified that at the time the violation allegedly occurred, he was responding to an emergency call; specifically to transport a patient to a local hospital. At the close of the case defendant moved to dismiss the information upon the ground that his vehicle was exempt from the operation of the ordinance by reason of the provisions of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1104(b)(3). The statute permitted the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle to exceed maximum speed limits, under certain conditions, so long as he did not endanger life or property. The People asserted that defendant however was required to operate his vehicle in conformity with a further section of the park commission ordinance, which required all vehicles on park commission land, including emergency vehicles to obey the speed limit. Emergency vehicles could use the parkways, as an exception to the class of vehicles to which the highways were generally restricted, but the vehicles had to nonetheless obey the maximum speed limits fixed for all users of the highway. The court found defendant guilty.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State park commissions and parkway authorities may regulate traffic and establish speed limits for their highways (Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 1630); and such regulations validly and constitutionally supersede general provisions permitting emergency vehicles to exceed speed limits (cf.  Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 1104).  An ordinance adopted by the Long Island State Park Commission permits licensed ambulances, when on emergency service, to use the parkways &quot;but subject to all the provisions of these ordinances regulating traffic including limitations of the rate of speed&quot;.  Accordingly, the driver of a private ambulance was found guilty of speeding on a Long Island State Park Commission highway, though he was responding to an emergency call. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a trial court (New York) of violating N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 381(6), which required the use of a protective helmet while operating or riding a motorcycle. Defendant appealed, challenging the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the helmet requirement, claiming that it was vague and uncertain and that in regulating individual conduct, it was outside the scope of the State's police power. The argument that the subdivision was vague and uncertain was directed at the mandate that the helmet be approved by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. The court held that the use and nature of protective helmets in industry, in athletics and in the military services was known generally to the public. For motorcycle riders as a class the Commissioner approved the types of helmets which lawfully could be sold by commercial dealers. The section was not so vague and uncertain as to render it unconstitutional. The court also found that the danger of flying stones or other objects from the wheels of moving vehicles was a real one and a blow on the head of a cyclist not only could endanger himself, but be the cause of injury or death to other users of the public highways. To prevent such possible occurrences was a valid objective for legislative action under the general police power of the State.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; Y51-12.0 required the Administrator to enter an order of decontrol after a public hearing whenever studies and investigations established that there were vacancies in a class of housing accommodations of five percent or more. The United States Bureau of the Census disclosed that there was more than a five percent vacancy in residential housing in the City of the New York. The landlord requested a hearing by the Administrator for an order of decontrol. The Administrator refused the landlord's request on the ground that the central factor for consideration was the net vacancy rate, which was indisputably less than five percent. The landlord filed a petition for a writ of mandamus against the Administrator to conduct a public hearing and to enter an order of decontrol. The court dismissed the petition on the ground that the New York City Council had previously determined that the criteria for application of &sect; Y51-12.0 was based upon the net vacancy rate and that the landlord was not entitled to a writ of mandamus based upon his disagreement with the Administrator's finding and interpretation of the appropriate vacancy rate factor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 8 of the Waterfront Commission Act (L. 1953, ch. 882, as amd.) provides that no person shall collect or receive dues for any labor union if any officer, agent or employee has been convicted of a felony.

Section 29 of the former Penal Law, which is applicable because the violation occurred before September 1, 1967, and which makes a misdemeanor out of the performance of an act prohibited by statute for which no penalty is provided, is vague, does not inform the public as to which statutes it applies, lacks standards and lacks due process of law in violation of the Federal and State Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with attempted robbery. Defendants moved to inspect the grand jury minutes, contending that the 1967 Grand Jury was illegally constituted in that it was not selected and impaneled pursuant to the procedural requirements of N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. By a resolution of the Genesee County Board of Supervisors and an order of the Appellate Division, Fourth Department, appointing a Genesee County Jury Board, the county elected in 1966 to be governed by article 18 of the Judiciary Law. However, there is no record that said Jury Board ever met or made any appointments.  The County Clerk acted as the Commissioner of Jurors and selected trial jurors and grand jurors. Existing jury lists were used, plus names of additional persons who were examined and found to be qualified, and a Grand Jury was drawn from the master list of some 8,000 jurors without first drawing 300 names.  Despite these procedural irregularities, the Grand Jury conformed to the traditional concept of a Grand Jury and consisted of legally qualified persons who represented a fair cross section&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the impartial citizens of the county.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved for an order dismissing an assault in the third degree complaint brought by his wife contending that the Family Court had exclusive original jurisdiction over an intrafamilial assault case, and that the court was therefore devoid of jurisdiction. The court rejected this contention, finding that the authorities did not intend that an act as defined and set forth in the Penal Law was not to be considered a crime simply because it was perpetrated by one spouse upon the other. The court held that N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect;&sect; 813, 814, in their entirety, appeared to be inconsistent with N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect;&sect; 811, 812 of the same article, and further appear to violate the constitutional provision setting up the Family Court. Accordingly, the court held that it had original jurisdiction of all misdemeanors committed any place within the territorial jurisdiction of the court and this fact, taken together with the transferral provisions contained in N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect;&sect; 813 and 814 of the Family Court Act, precluded a dismissal of the complaint except on the grounds of legal insufficiency.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The District Court does not lack jurisdiction of an assault in the third degree complaint made by a wife against her husband.

Section 813 provides that any criminal complaint charging assault between spouses shall be transferred by the criminal court to the Family Court.  Section 814 directs the criminal court, after entertaining an assault charge between spouses, to transfer the proceeding, to hold defendant, admit him to bail or parole defendant for hearing before the Family Court.  While sections 813 and 814 appear to be contrary to the acknowledged purpose of section 811, the District Court has jurisdiction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the assault charge and such jurisdiction precludes dismissal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original proceeding before the court, defendant was charged with violations of two ordinances, selling leaflets, magazines, booklets, and newspapers, without a peddler's license and obstructing a sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating two ordinances when she sold leaflets, magazines, booklets, and newspapers supporting the Viet Cong and protesting the Vietnam War. The first ordinance alleged a violation for selling the materials without a peddler's license. The second ordinance related to obstruction of the sidewalk. Defendant contended that the material she sold were manifestations of communication of thoughts and ideas implicit in the protections afforded to free speech. The court agreed with this contention. On the second charge, the court held that based on all the evidence, and recognizing the unusually wide width of the sidewalk, the mid-afternoon time of the alleged offense, the conflicting testimony as to the density of the pedestrian traffic, and the mighty strength of defendant's constitutional right to speak out her views, defendant was not guilty of obstructing the sidewalk.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the complaints against defendant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant housewife selling leaflets, magazines, booklets and newspapers, all of them urging support of the Viet Cong and opposing the war in Vietnam, and also selling flags and buttons containing legends supporting the Viet Cong and opposing the Vietnam war, is not guilty of violating a section of the New York City Administrative Code requiring a peddler to obtain a license. Her sale of the articles was for the purpose of communicating her ideas and convictions.  The peddler license ordinance was not intended to strike down&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the right of free speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 692h-1.0 of the Administrative Code is construed to make unlawful those acts committed on public streets which so substantially impede or delay the convenient and safe passage of pedestrian traffic as to curtail seriously and without any legal justification the use thereof by others but cannot infringe on First Amendment rights.  So construed, the section is not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. While defendant had a right to place a table on the sidewalk incidental to her distribution, and incidental sale, of literature, buttons and flags, her conduct did not go beyond a clear and proper exercise of her right of freedom of speech. The sidewalk was wide, the time was 3:30 in the afternoon and there was conflicting testimony as to the density of pedestrian traffic. Defendant is not guilty and the complaint is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a nonprofit hospital, filed an application to stay compulsory arbitration between it and respondent union as ordered by respondent New York Industrial Commissioner. The hospital sought to restrain the New York State Board of Mediation, which was designated by the Industrial Commissioner as arbitrator, from proceeding to arbitrate the dispute between the hospital and the union.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital argued that it had a right to judicial review of the union's certification as the bargaining representative; and that N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 716 was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the Industrial Commissioner and the New York State Mediation Board. The court disagreed and dismissed the petition. A certification by the Labor Board as to the proper bargaining representative under N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 705 could not be judicially reviewed. The claim to stay arbitration on that ground was denied. The claim that &sect; 716 was unconstitutional because it improperly delegated power to the State Board of Mediation and the Industrial Commissioner without providing legislative standards to guide them in the exercise of those powers appeared equally without merit. The statute and its amendments were designed to avoid labor disputes in voluntary hospitals by coupling the extension of collective bargaining rights with a prohibition against strikes. The Industrial Commissioner had the experience which justified reliance upon his expertise in determining which remedy was most likely to effect the statutory purpose in each particular case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A voluntary, nonprofit hospital's refusal to acknowledge a union's certification as collective bargaining representative for maintenance employees is a flouting of a mandate of the Appellate Division which directed it to begin collective bargaining and to seek judicial review as to the propriety of the certification upon an appeal from a final order in an enforcement proceeding (26 A D 2d 543). Arbitration will not be stayed on the ground that petitioner is entitled first to judicial review of the certification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 716 of the Labor Law, which seeks to avoid labor disputes in voluntary, nonprofit hospitals by forbidding strikes and requiring compulsory collective bargaining, fact finding and binding arbitration in its stead, grants discretion to the Industrial Commissioner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to determine which remedy is most suitable and such discretion is not an improper delegation of legislative authority rendering the section unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion seeking to dismiss various grand jury indictments, contending that the grand jury selection process violated the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the U.S. and New York Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contested the various grand jury indictments against him, contending that members of low income groups, and particularly Negroes, Puerto Ricans, and persons of Italian and Jewish origin were deliberately and systematically excluded from the jury pool. The court upheld the validity of the indictments, however. The court held that defendant has failed to rebut the presumption that the grand jury was properly empanelled and acted with propriety, validating the indictments. The court further held that defendant had failed to demonstrate that he had been prejudiced by the alleged irregularities in selection of grand jurors, or that any of the grand jurors was incompetent and should have been disqualified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grand jury -- selection of jurors -- sections 596 and 609 of Judiciary Law providing qualifications of grand jurors and manner of their selection are constitutional -- use of questionnaires to prospective jurors to determine their qualifications is not extension of powers of County Clerk -- no evidence of arbitrary exclusion from panel of grand jurors of any ethnic or racial group -- presumption that Grand Jury was properly impaneled was not rebutted and defendant's indictment was proper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 596 and section 609 of the Judiciary Law which provide, respectively, the qualifications to be possessed by grand jurors and the manner in which they are to be selected within the City of New York are constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The use of questionnaires to prospective jurors to determine if they meet the qualifications set forth in section 596 of the Judiciary Law is not an unwarranted extension of the powers of the County Clerk who by section 609 is authorized to make special investigations of grand jurors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There is in the record no evidence of any effort by the County Clerk arbitrarily to exclude persons of a particular classification&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from the panel of grand jurors. In the absence of clear proof to the contrary, the County Clerk is presumed to have performed his duty and defendant's rights are presumed not to have been violated.  There is no proof that the Grand Jury which indicted defendant was not composed of a cross section of the community.  The County Clerk fairly and honestly discharged his duties and did not discriminate against Negroes, Puerto Ricans, and persons of Italian and Jewish origin and extraction. There was no willful and planned discrimination and exclusion in the selection of grand jurors based on race, color, creed or economic standing in the years 1958 through 1962.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Defendant has failed to rebut the presumption that the Grand Jury was properly impaneled and acted with propriety and that the indictments are valid.  Defendant has not offered any proof as to the financial or ethnic makeup of the panel of jurors which indicted him or how he was prejudiced by their selection as grand jurors. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, conceding the sufficiency of the prosecution's prima facie proof of their violation of the relevant section of the zoning law, relied for acquittal upon the law's asserted unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with zoning law violations, including over-occupancy of their residential property. While admitting that the prosecution had made out its prima facie case, defendants challenged the laws' constitutionality because they had been rarely enforced in the years since their enactment. In addition, defendants alleged that the laws were not validly enacted. The court upheld the ordinances' constitutionality and validity. The court held that the breakdown in enforcement was not so widespread, so long continued, and so persistently ignored as to convert a constitutional and lawful enactment into one that could not any longer be enforced. There was insufficient evidence that the 1922 ordinance was published in the local paper within seven days of enactment, but there was insufficient evidence that it was not. Because the ordinance had been in force so long, there was a presumption in favor of its legality. The court also upheld the 1930 version, deciding that the variances from the ordinance as published and as enacted were insignificant and did not require striking down the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the constitutionality and validity of the local zoning laws.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- change of conditions warranting invalidation of zoning ordinance limiting number of families in dwelling to two need not be of legal character -- no breakdown of enforcement of ordinance shown -- that defendants' property is worth more as three-family house is irrelevant -- evidence as to defendants' deliberate acquisition of property bears on degree of guilt -- 1922 zoning ordinance not invalid because publication may have been eight, rather than seven, days after passage -- 1930 ordinance not invalid because changes made after publication -- defendants are guilty of violating ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. To strike down a zoning ordinance limiting to two the number of families in a dwelling a change in conditions subsequent to enactment need not be of a legal character.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. While disregard of an ordinance may become so widespread as to make the statute a dead letter and enforcement discriminatory as to those selected for prosecution, where 108 dwellings are located within a three-block area in which the subject premises are located, and there were violations in 28 of them, 18 owners having been either convicted or having offered guilty pleas and are now&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  complying, and the remaining 10 possibly being legal by reason of variances or prior nonconforming use, there has been no breakdown in enforcement so widespread and continued as to convert a constitutional enactment into one which can no longer be enforced.  There was no breakdown in enforcement even if the original 28 violators be considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. That defendants' property is worth more as a three-family house is irrelevant and immaterial in determining whether this prosecution is maintainable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Evidence as to defendants' deliberate acquisition of the property with actual or implied knowledge of the restrictions was properly received on the question of the degree of their guilt rather than on the issue as to their criminal responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The zoning ordinance originally enacted in 1922 and sustained in 1938 may not be declared invalid for insubstantial reasons, such as that in 1922 the ordinance may have been published eight rather than seven days after passage, especially since thousands of transactions have been consummated in reliance on the validity of the ordinance. The presumption of nonpublication arising from the absence of the required certificate ( CPLR 4532) has been&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  overcome.  The 1922 zoning ordinance was validly enacted and remained legally in force until replaced by the 1930 ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Although the 1930 ordinance as proposed and published and as adopted differed because of changes made after publication, the changes being limited and having no reference to the maximum permissible occupancy, did not require republication or invalidation.  Insignificant error in passage or promulgation does not justify upsetting the thousands of transactions consummated on basis of the 1930 ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Defendants are found guilty of violating the ordinance. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. County Law &sect; 411 prohibited county judges, and the district attorney, sheriff, county clerk, or any elective county officer to be eligible to hold at the same time any other elective county or town office, or that of city supervisor. The board of supervisors proposed to disband and allow 15 county legislators to be elected at the general election. The proposal allowed all supervisors of the towns in the county to be eligible for election to the county board of legislators. The proposed local law was to be effective only if it was approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the qualified electors voting upon the law at the general election of November 7, 1967. The board argued that it could enact the law pursuant to N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 10 and its power of home rule. The court held that: (1) under the proposed law it was mathematically possible for every member of the legislative body to cast the decisive vote on legislation in substantially the same ratio that the population of his constituency bore to the total population; (2) the board could not change the law under home rule; and (3) the voters were entitled to a referendum.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court gave the board of supervisors an extension to enable it to submit one or more constitutionally valid plans of reapportionment. The court adjourned the matter for five days.</SPAN></P>

A proposed local law of the existing malapportioned Board of Supervisors of a county, creating a County Board of Legislators which would still consist of only one from each town regardless of the town's population, and which would allow Supervisors to be elected as legislators also, but which would so differently weight the voting power of the different legislators on the board as to give each legislator a decisive vote on proposed legislation in substantially the same ratio which his town's population bears to the county's population, would comply with the constitutional principle that each legislator must represent substantially the same number of electors as any other legislator.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prior suit, the court held that the apportionment of defendant county board of supervisors was unconstitutional, and it refused to approve a proposed voting plan submitted by the board. Subsequently, the Court of Appeals (New York) considered the propriety of an adjusted weighted voting plan and a fractional-weighted voting plan. On remand, the court heard testimony from an expert on those types of plans.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the hearing, the expert testified that it was possible to determine the number of times when the &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; votes of a legislator having a certain number of votes would pass or defeat a measure by a mathematical formula. The expert testified that it was possible to program that function into a computer so that it would produce results in 10 or 15 minutes depending on the number of towns in the county. The court found that the expert's analyses fairly represented adjusted weighted voting plans where it was mathematically possible for every member of the legislative body to cast the decisive vote on legislation in the same ratio which the population of his constituency bore to the total population of the county. The court concluded that either of the plans on which it heard testimony satisfied the &quot;one person, one vote&quot; principle and that both were constitutional. The court then addressed how the county could take action to recognize the voting power of each supervisor. The court held that under home rule the board had to enact a local law that provided for a constitutional voting plan like those considered by the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county board of supervisors had to promptly enact a local law in conformity with the court's opinion, without the need for a referendum, in order to proceed with a proper voting plan. The county had to adopt the law no later than January 1, 1968.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner alleged narcotic addict, detained involuntarily pursuant to N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 206, sought his release on the grounds that the statute in question was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Alleged narcotic addict was ordered committed, pursuant to a warrant, for an examination and possibly for rehabilitative treatment. He sued, claiming that the statute authorizing his arrest, detention, and involuntary rehabilitation was unconstitutional. The statute provided that the alleged addict could be arrested upon an ex parte application alleging that he was an addict, then subjected to an examination regarding his possible addiction at which he could be obliged to answer a physician's questions, and if found to be an addict ordered to undergo treatment. After that determination, he was granted counsel and could file a challenge to the compulsory treatment order. The court held that this procedure was unconstitutional and it ordered the alleged addict's release. Alleged addict needed to be provided with legal counsel prior to the examination, so as to protect his self-incrimination privilege.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Alleged addict's application for release on grounds of statutory unconstitutionality was granted. The detention statute was unconstitutional since it failed to provide an alleged addict with counsel prior to a mandatory physical examination at which the alleged addict was required to respond to a physician's questions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Section 206 of the Mental Hygiene Law, which deals with narcotic addicts, provides the procedures for the rehabilitation of addicts including an involuntary civil commitment. In the instant case, a warrant for the apprehension of the addict was signed on May 2, 1967, the warrant stating that it was issued upon the petition of the addict's mother.  The addict first became aware of the proceeding when he was apprehended by an officer, detained and delivered to a reception center for a medical examination. On May 3, 1967 he was examined by a doctor who took a history, the report of the doctor giving an opinion that the addict should be certified as an addict and indicating that the addict had admitted that he had taken heroin.  On May 5, 1967 the addict was brought into court and he then requested a hearing and the assignment of counsel.  The procedures of section 206 of the Mental Hygiene Law deprived the addict of his constitutional rights to remain silent and to the advice of counsel.  The doctor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by whom the addict was examined was a State doctor and the usual privilege between doctor and patient was ignored.  The addict's rights under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Miranda </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Arizona</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (384 U.S. 436) were violated.  It is immaterial that the mother initiated the proceeding since the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission then became the prosecutor.  His detention by the warrant made him a prisoner and his examination by the doctor without an attorney violated his constitutional rights. It is immaterial that he is charged with a sickness.  The penalty is detention for up to three years.  The law should be amended to provide that an order or warrant be returnable before the court after service on the addict of all papers so that he could be advised of his constitutional rights. </SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the municipality had to post suitable signs before the ordinance could be effective. The prosecution argued that the city had a right to adopt the ordinance under N.Y.

The court held that: (1) the city had a right to select the holidays on which the parking meters were to be in operation; (2) the failure of the city to designate on the parking meters the various holidays as defined by the city ordinance was confusing; therefore, the ordinance was unenforceable; and (3) until the city clarified the days when payment was not required, the term &quot;holiday&quot; as appearing on the parking meters would be interpreted to mean all of the holidays as defined in N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation brought a proceeding against respondent, zoning board of appeals (board), for certiorari review of the board's upholding of the denial of the corporation's application for a permit to construct a multiple-family garden court apartment; the corporation also filed an action seeking declaratory judgment that defendant town's zoning ordinance was unconstitutional. The court consolidated the cases and rendered its decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation sought approval to construct an apartment court. It adduced evidence that the property could not be advantageously used for any purpose permitted by Town of Chili, N.Y., Zoning Ordinance para. 19-7 (1947). A building inspector denied the corporation a building permit. The board upheld denial of the permit. The corporation filed a petition under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 for review of the board's decision and filed a complaint seeking declaratory judgment that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The corporation argued that separation resulting from appropriation of part of the tract for an interstate highway completely frustrated use of the severed portion in conformance with the ordinance, and as such amounted to legal confiscation rendering the ordinance invalid. The court denied the petition and dismissed the complaint. The board's denial of an application for a variance was not so unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious as to amount to an abuse of discretion as a matter of law. The ordinance was not unconstitutional. Any loss suffered by the corporation was caused not by any act of the town, but by state action, and the severance was not without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A corporation purchased approximately 31 acres in a one-family zone, and built one-family dwellings on the small part which fronted on a street, and sold all the dwellings, and thereby recouped the price it had paid for all of the 31 acres. Then the State appropriated, for a limited access highway, a 100-foot-wide strip comprising 9.3 acres, which diagonally divided the rest of this acreage into a 17-acre parcel and a triangular 4.02-acre parcel. The State paid the corporation $ 40,000.  This was almost four times the price which the corporation had paid for the whole 31 acres six years earlier; that is, this&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was at about ten times the original price per acre. A reasonable inference is that the $ 40,000 included severance or consequential damages. Then the corporation combined the 17 acres with other land and sold it for between $ 35,000 and $ 40,000, and sold topsoil for $ 8,900.  Thus, the corporation's profit on its original small investment totaled about $ 84,000, and it still had 4.02 acres left.  Then the corporation applied to the town's Zoning Board of Appeals for a hardship variance to allow it to build a 60-family garden court apartment development on the 4.02 acres. The corporation's asserted hardship is that this remaining 4.02-acre parcel is triangular, and that, since the zoning ordinance permits only one-family dwellings on 25% of a minimum lot area and requires setbacks, the corporation can build only seven dwellings, and that the corporation's total expenses for streets, sewers, utilities and sales promotion would average about $ 6,000 a house, and that therefore the corporation cannot economically offer seven dwellings for sale at the $ 18,000 to $ 22,000 price range of other house in the neighborhood, and furthermore, that the topography and soil are not advantageous&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for a farm or nursery or school or any of the dozen other uses which the zoning ordinance allows in a one-family zone.  The board properly denied the application for a variance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The board's refusal to modify the zoning plan and change the character of the neighborhood, in order that the corporation might reap a further profit, was not arbitrary or unreasonable.  The corporation's difficulties were caused, not by the ordinance, but by the State's severance of the 31 acres, and for those consequential damages the corporation has already received full compensation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Since the court is now dismissing the corporation's petition under article 78 of the CPLR to review the board's determination, the court has properly before it now the corporation's plenary action for a judgment to declare that the zoning ordinance is confiscatory and unconstitutional as applied to these 4.02 acres. The zoning ordinance is not thus confiscatory and unconstitutional; and the court will render a judgment so declaring and a judgment dismissing the article 78 proceeding.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Decedent's car, while stopped for a traffic light, was struck in the rear by a car operated by another person.  Decedent was treated by his family doctor for a contusion of the knee and for a sprain of the cervical and lumbar spine.  Six and a half weeks later he died of an acute myocardial infarction which the autopsy showed to be a &quot;massive cardiac tamponade due to ruptured aorta, ascending&quot;.  The probabilities are that a jury, presented with all the evidence, would&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  find that his death was not causally related to the injury.  He was 49 years old, his average weekly wage was $ 173, his lost earnings for the six weeks were $ 1,113, and his medical expenses were about $ 204.  A verdict of $ 3,500 to $ 4,000 seems probable.  His administratrix is granted an order approving, as reasonable in amount, a settlement for $ 20,000 of her action for his conscious pain and his wrongful death (Decedent Estate Law, &sect; 135; Workmen's Compensation Law, &sect; 29, subd. 5, as amd.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Subdivision 5 (as amd.) of section 29 of the Workmen's Compensation Law is authorized by the State Constitution (art. I, &sect; 18) and does not violate the workmen's compensation carrier's rights of fair trial and due process of law or deprive said carrier of any vested property right, even though, when this accident occurred, said subdivision 5 did not provide for court approval, over the carrier's objection as to the amount, of a compromise of the third-party action for an amount less than the compensation payable by the carrier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Of the $ 20,000 settlement, the court allocates $ 3,500 to the cause of action for conscious pain, and $ 16,500 to the cause of action for wrongful death. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The fee of the attorney is fixed, on said first cause of action at $ 1,100, and on said second cause of action at $ 5,500, both inclusive of disbursements.  The funeral expenses were $ 987.  Thus, $ 10,013 of the wrongful death recovery remain for distribution.  At death, decedent was 49 and had a life expectancy of 23.6 years.  His wife was 43 and had a life expectancy of 32.9 years.  Thus their joint expectancy was 23.6 years.  His 16-year-old daughter would reach her majority in 4 years, 8 months, and 23 days; his 12-year-old daughter in 8 years, 10 months, and 26 days; and his 8-year-old son in 12 years, 9 months and 13 days.  Using the formula in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Matter of Kaiser</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (198 Misc. 582), and there being no evidence that any of decedent's three children will require support beyond majority, the courts fixes distribution (Decedent Estate Law, &sect; 133) as follows: to the widow 47.2%; to the older daughter 9.5%; to the younger daughter 17.8%; and to the son 25.5%.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent resident challenged the issuance of a warrant pursuant to which he was taken into custody and taken to a facility under the jurisdiction of the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission (NACC). Petitioner mother filed an application for the civil certification of her son to the NACC pursuant to the N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 206.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to the issuance of a warrant, the mother testified that she was a diabetic and that on a number of occasions the resident had taken her insulin syringe. The mother also testified that the resident asked her to ask their family doctor to give him a prescription for methadone, which she did. A physician examined the resident and certified that he was dependent on narcotic drugs. The resident challenged &sect; 206 on constitutional grounds. The court determined that the testimony of the physician and the mother established that the resident was dependent on narcotics within the definition of N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 201(2). Further, it was not error for the trial court to deny the mother's request to withdraw the application and discontinue the proceeding because under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 3217, the mother asserted no claim against the resident for which he was liable to her. Additionally, the court rejected the resident's claim that compulsory confinement constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Likewise, the resident's right to due process was not violated by the medical interview and examination, which occurred prior to a full hearing in the question of addiction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mental Hygiene Law (art. 9, entitled Drug Addiction) validly exercises the police power of the State to provide a civil proceeding, instituted by a petition, for the compulsory medical and judicial examination and certification of persons who are dependent upon narcotic drugs, and for the civil custody and treatment of such persons in a closed setting for not exceeding three years (Mental Hygiene Law, art. 9, &sect;&sect; 200, 201, 204, 206, 206-a, 206-b).  The statute's definition of such persons is not unconstitutionally vague, and the statute's procedure for certification of such persons does not contravene their rights under the United States Constitution (4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, 14th Amdts.).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for robbery in the first degree, grand larceny in the second degree, assault with intent to commit a felony, and possession of a dangerous weapon. Defendant applied by motion for a pretrial hearing challenging the police lineup. The court denied defendant's motion for a pre-trial hearing, holding that no pretrial hearing was necessary. But once the in-court identification of defendant was sought to be introduced, and the court was apprised that the identification was questioned on the basis of a prior police station identification, and defense counsel filed a motion for a hearing to be held outside of the presence of the jury, the trial would be suspended until the completion of the evidence on the hearing and the ruling thereon by the court. Furthermore, if the procedures in the police station were violative of due process, the People were precluded from offering any evidence of the prior identification, but the witness could still identify defendant as the perpetrator of the crime if that identification could be sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The provisional employee had accrued vacation pay prior to his termination by the city, which he filed an action to recover. The city contended that certification of an eligible list prevented it from granting the provisional employee his accrued vacation pay in that his salary line was taken over by the new employee and that there was no other line or authorization to predicate payment to him. The court did not question the city's right to dismiss the provisional employee. However, the court awarded judgment to the provisional employee for recovery of his accrued vacation pay. The court held that the provisional employee had a vested right to receive compensation for work actually performed, which included salary and accrued vacation pay in accordance with Rule 5.17 of the Rules and Regulations for Administrative Employees of the Board of Education of the City of New York. Thus, the language of Rule 5.17 providing for such payment &quot;unless certification of eligible list prevents&quot; violated the provisional employee's substantive due process rights, pursuant to N.Y.

Any other construction of said rule 5.17 would unconstitutionally deprive him of an earned, vested right. To pay him what he has earned would not be a gift of public funds (cf. N. Y. Const., art.

The buyer purchased a car manufactured by the car companies which caught fire. The buyer filed a claim for negligence and breach of warranty against the car companies.

The court held that there was no constitutional prohibition in applying N.Y. C.P.L.R. 302(a) retroactively to a claim filed after its effective date based on events before its effective date. The court further held that the &quot;substantial revenue&quot; provision of N.Y. C.P.L.R.302(a) was not unconstitutional because it was predicated on the concept that a defendant who derived substantial revenue from goods used or consumed in the state had sufficient contact with the state to justify jurisdiction over the defendant in an action for damage to property which occurred in the state as a result of acts of the defendant outside the state.</SPAN></P>

[a], par. 3, cls. [i], [ii], as amd. eff. Sept. 1, 1966) -- retroactive application of amendment constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An English corporation manufactures Aston Martin automobiles.  A Pennsylvania corporation imports them and services them and resells and delivers them in Pennsylvania to dealers. A domestic dealer gets them in Pennsylvania and resells them in New York and the Eastern seaboard.  About April 29, 1966, plaintiff purchased one from said&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  New York dealer, who delivered it to plaintiff in New York.  On May 20, 1966, the automobile caught fire and was destroyed, allegedly because of defective manufacture and service.  In 1967 plaintiff commenced this action, for negligence and breach of warranty, against the dealer and the Pennsylvania importer and the English manufacturer. Motion of the latter two defendants for a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction over them is denied; however, this denial is without prejudice to their asserting the same defense in their answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Neither the Pennsylvania corporation nor the English corporation &quot;regularly does or solicits business&quot; in New York&quot; or engages in any other persistent course of conduct&quot; in New York ( CPLR 302, subd. [a], par. 3, cl. [i]), despite their exhibition at the 1967 New York Automobile Show.  Their New York distributor is not shown to be their agent, but merely an independent contractor to whom a distributorship has been granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. However, this is an action for allegedly committing &quot;a tortious act&quot; -- defective manufacture or service -- &quot;without the state causing injury to person or property within the state&quot; ( CPLR 302, subd. [a], par. 3); and each of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the moving defendants has failed to sustain its burden of showing that it does not come within the further provisions which read &quot;(i) * * * derives substantial revenue from goods used or consumed or services rendered, in the state, or (ii) expects or should reasonably expect the act to have consequences in the state and derives substantial revenue from interstate or international commerce&quot; (as amd. by L. 1966, ch. 590).  The &quot;substantial revenue&quot; provisions do not require any connection between the tortious act and the revenue from goods or services or commerce; and the &quot;reasonably expect&quot; provision refers to forum consequences in general and not to the specific event which produced an injury within this State.  Defendants' own affidavits show that six automobiles, valued for customs purposes at $ 55,586, moved in international commerce from the English corporation to the Pennsylvania corporation, and they also state facts which raise inferences that the Pennsylvania corporation derives all of its revenue from interstate or international commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. However, it may be possible for either or both of said defendants to prove that they do not derive &quot;substantial revenue&quot;, within the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  meaning of the above-cited statute; and therefore they are granted leave to raise the jurisdictional issue in their answer or answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. There is no constitutional objection to applying CPLR 302 (subd. [a], par. 3, cls. [i], [ii], as amd. by L. 1966, ch. 590, eff. Sept. 1, 1966) to this 1967 action which is based on events which occurred in April and May of 1966.  The amended statute itself appears to be constitutional, and the moving defendants have not shown that they justifiably relied on the old statute.  They may, if so advised, set forth in their answers any facts which will establish that they justifiably relied on the old statute.  </SPAN></P>

Law &sect; 380(3) for transporting by motor vehicle over the highways within the state a dangerous article without conspicuously marking or placarding the motor vehicle. More specifically, defendants were charged with transporting 15 drums of ethylene oxide weighing 10,038 pounds.

Defendants were caught transporting a hazardous liquid without the proper warning labels and in amounts in excess of what was legally permitted. Defendants contended that &sect; 380(3) should be interpreted to require a criminal intent, which neither allegedly had, or that if no criminal intent was need the statute was unconstitutional as an inconsistent invasion of a sphere pre-empted by the Federal government, which had a similar regulation. Defendants also contended it was error for the State not to test the liquid to determine its composition. The court convicted defendants. It was not unconstitutional for &sect; 380 to eliminate the prescribed element of mens rea and create thereby a public welfare offense because the exclusive occupation of a sphere of regulation was not to be implied unless the act of Congress was in actual conflict with law of the State. And, because defendants rested without putting on any evidence from which to contradict the State's case, defendants could not complain that a test was not performed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tractor-trailer, carrying more than 2,500 pounds of ethylene oxide, which is a flammable liquid as defined in section 380 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law and as defined in the regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission (Code of Fed. Reg., tit. 49), was driven into the Holland Tunnel to the New York side without any placards or markings on the vehicle stating &quot;dangerous&quot; or the name of the hazard (Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 380, subd. 3; 15 NYCRR 67.6 [a] [1]).  The driver and the freight transportation corporation are found guilty of violating said New York statute.  It was not necessary for the People to make a chemical test of this dangerous liquid.

The United States Code (tit. 18, &sect; 834, subd.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother applied for an order modifying upward an out of state divorce decree, which incorporated by reference, but did not merge within, a separation agreement entered into with respondent father. The mother's application was based on grounds that the child was older, that the child's needs had increased, that he needed psychiatric care, and that the father's income was now four times as initially reported.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The terms of the agreement contemplated the possibility that the father's income might increase over time and accordingly provided for an escalation in support payments. The father contended that the court lacked jurisdiction to modify and out of state decree, that the alimony increase lacked merit, and that there were no substantial change of circumstances. The court ruled against the father on the jurisdiction issue and ruled in his favor on the other issues. The court held that because N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 7(c), empowered it to hear new classes of actions, it had jurisdiction to hear the current action because enforcement or modification of out of state divorce decrees were a new class of action pursuant to &sect;&sect; 461, 466, of the Fam. Ct. Act. The court further held that the mother was in no position to request an increase in alimony because the initial agreement was adequate when made and that there was no showing that she was unable to support herself or in danger of becoming a public charge. As for the child support, the court held that there was no substantial change of circumstances because the increased salary was anticipated and provisions were made in the agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the mother's application with respect to increased alimony, denied the application insofar as it sought an increase in support for the child, and retained jurisdiction to determine if the child was in need of psychiatric therapy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Family Court has jurisdiction to modify the support provisions of an out-of-State divorce decree (N. Y. Const., art. VI, &sect; 7, subd. c; art. VI, &sect; 13, subd. c; Family Ct. Act, &sect; 461, subd. [b]; &sect; 466, subd. [c]).  But, if the decree incorporates by reference a separation agreement which contains a provision that it shall not merge into a divorce judgment, and if the support agreement for the wife was valid and adequate when originally made, then the support provisions for the wife cannot be increased subsequently unless she comes in actual danger of becoming a public charge ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">McMains </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> McMains</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 15 N Y 2d 283, followed).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. However, the agreement's support provisions for the child can be increased if they were improvident or inadequate when made, or if the child's needs or the father's means have substantially increased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. But, in the present case, the separation agreement provides, for the support of the wife and child, a minimum payment plus percentages of the husband's income.  Thus the agreement fairly, reasonably and adequately provides for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the child according to the father's means.  There is no proof that the child needs an increase.  Nor is there any proof that the child's welfare is being impaired by the visitation provisions of the agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A separation agreement dated January 1, 1963 was incorporated by reference into a Nevada divorce decree in March, 1963.  However, the agreement provided that it should not merge into the decree. The agreement provided for the support of the wife and child, annually, 1/3 of the first $ 15,000 of the husband's adjusted gross income, plus 30% of the next $ 9,000 plus 25% of the next $ 12,000 plus 20% of the next $ 14,000, but such support was never to be less than $ 5,000 nor more than $ 13,500; and, in addition, he was to pay all hospital, surgical and dental expenses of the child which exceeded 5% of the sum thus paid to the wife in any calendar year; and he was to determine whether and which Summer camp the child should attend, and he was to pay the reasonable expenses thereof; and he was to have extensive rights of visitation, and to have exclusive control of the child's education, and he was to pay all charges for tuition, board, lodging and expenses of the child at such&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  school or college as he selected; and, except in emergencies, he was not to be liable for any extraordinary expenses for orthodontures or surgery or psychiatry to which he had not consented in advance.  The wife's application to the Family Court, New York County, three and a half years later, to increase the support provisions and to decrease the visitation and Summer camp provisions, is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. However, if the parties cannot reconcile their views as to whether the child needs psychotherapy, the Family Court will refer the child to the court's psychiatric consultation service for a study and report to the court.  If the court determines that the child needs such therapy, the court will direct the father to pay therefor as provided in the separation agreement, and will further direct that he pay a $ 500 counsel fee; otherwise, no counsel fee will be allowed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner bar association instituted a summary proceeding seeking an order adjudging respondents, the author, publisher, and distributor of a book titled &quot;How To Avoid Probate,&quot; guilty of criminal contempt of court for unauthorized practice of law in violation of N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 750(B) and imposing a permanent injunction, along with other injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The author had been enjoined for the unauthorized practice of law in Connecticut, where he had confronted the public directly, offered his advice as an expert estate planner and distributed trust forms. The book made the same representations enjoined in Connecticut and included printed forms for use by the public. The author asserted his U.S. Const. amend. I rights. The court found the author in contempt for violation of &sect; 750(B) and enjoined his unauthorized practice of law. The court ruled that the author was engaged in the practice of law, which included the drafting of forms and giving advice as to their use. The court held that the author's unauthorized practice, already prohibited in Connecticut, did not attain the security of a constitutional umbrella through the device of transferring that unauthorized practice to a book. The court found that there was no inherent right to the practice of law, which the state had the power to license, regulate, and control. The court found that the violation was clear with regard to the author, but not the publisher and distributor, and, thus, denied the injunction with regard to those respondents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed an action under the Martin Act (Act), N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law art. 23-A, against defendant for fraud involving alleged wrongful manipulations of warehouse oil receipts. Several defrauded investors filed a motion to intervene and order a writ of mandamus to compel the state to appoint a receiver of defendant's property, which the state opposed. The court held that the state could not be compelled to make such an appointment. The court found that the attorney general, in enforcing the Act, did not become a securities commissioner who was subject to the directions of the court, as the investors claimed. The court noted that the performance of an administrative function did not convert the attorney general into an administrative officer. The court stated that the actions taken by the attorney general were as the chief legal officer of the state, that the prosecution of defendant was wholly within his discretion, and that the exercise of that discretion could not have been hampered by the courts. The court found that because intervention was permitted only when the court appointed a receiver, and the attorney general declined to do so, the moving parties could not intervene.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Martin Act (General Business Law, art. 23-A, &sect; 352 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.) provides that, if the Attorney-General &quot;believes it to be in the public interest * * * he may in his discretion&quot; investigate fraudulent transactions in respect to stocks, bonds and other securities (&sect; 352) and bring an injunction action (&sect; 353), and in such an action the court may appoint a receiver of the property and may then allow intervention by persons who seek to prove that they have an interest in the property held by the receiver (&sect; 353-a).  It is entirely within the discretion of the Attorney-General, the chief legal officer of the State (Executive Law, &sect; 63), whether or not to initiate any of these steps.  In such an action the court cannot, of its own volition or on motion of assertedly interested persons&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or of members of the public, appoint a receiver or direct the Attorney-General to apply for a receiver. In this case, the Attorney-General conducted a three-year investigation, and then served a complaint without filing it, and then entered a consent judgment and filed the complaint with the judgment.  Shortly thereafter, a bank and 21 insurance companies asked the court to vacate the consent judgment and reopen the action and permit them to intervene, and to appoint a receiver; and they also petitioned the court for an order under CPLR article 78 directing the Attorney-General to apply for a receiver and to make available to them the evidence which the Attorney-General collected in his investigation.  The motions are denied and the petitions are dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that this claim was without merit. Section 63(12) did not contain any language which made the Attorney-General's authority to issue a subpoena dependent upon the prior existence of proof that repeated fraudulent or illegal acts had in fact been engaged in. On the contrary, the statute empowered the Attorney-General to make a determination of the relevant facts, and it was for the purpose of determining the relevant facts prior to applying for injunction or cancellation of a certificate that he was authorized to issue subpoenas.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landowner brought before the court (New York) a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 to review and annul the decision of the respondent zoning board denying his application to use a municipal parking lot to satisfy the off-street parking requirements of the Town of Huntington Building Zone Ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner was the owner of a parcel of land situated in a town. On the parcel was situated a building consisting of two floors. The ground floor had been used for retail purposes and the second floor has been used for storage and residential purposes. The premises had been zoned &quot;general business.&quot; The landowner sought to convert the second floor for retail purposes. The court was presented with the unusual proposition of the right of a landowner to convert a nonconforming use to a conforming use. The court held that it had always been loathe to reverse a decision of the zoning board of appeals if it could find some basis for their decision in the record. But the court was required to reverse a decision of the board which in effect told the owner of a land blocked building, situated within 250 feet of a municipal parking lot, that he would be required to produce a parking lot or he would not be able to convert a nonconforming use to a conforming use, and which was so arbitrary, so capricious, so unreasonable, so contrary to public policy and the generally accepted standards of zoning, that it violated all principles of fairness and outraged every sense of justice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- permission to convert prior nonconforming residential use to conforming business use cannot be denied on ground that owner has no space on which to provide off-street parking, since municipal parking lot is nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner owns a lot on which stands a two-story building.  The ground floor is used for retail business purposes, and the second floor is used for storage and for residential purposes. The premises are in a business zone, and the residential use constitutes a prior nonconforming use. Petitioner's recent application for a building permit to convert the second floor for retail purposes -- a conforming use -- was denied, on the ground that the proposed conversion would constitute an intensification of the business use and therefore comes within the scope of a recent ordinance requiring the owner to provide off-street parking; and, since he has no space available for parking, the Zoning Board of Appeals unreasonably denied his application to satisfy the off-street parking requirement by use of a municipal parking lot which is about 250 feet from his building.  A zoning ordinance should be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  interpreted in accord with its public policy of gradually eliminating nonconforming uses.  Petitioner and all other taxpayers in the town are paying for the bond issue for said municipal parking lot. The other businesses which use said parking lot have no monopoly of it, even though it is generally full.  Petitioner cannot be required to find a tenant who will generate no traffic. The decision of the board is annulled.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the criminal prosecution of defendant for violation of the city's zoning ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that she was being singled out for prosecution. She alleged that three criminal prosecutions had been filed against her by the city's building department within less than a year, while others violators went unchallenged, unprosecuted, and unpunished. The court rejected defendant's contention, concluding that grounds supporting a finding of a denial of equal protection were not alleged and that defendant failed to sustain the &quot;heavy burden&quot; of proof of that degree of discriminatory action required to justify the implication-loaded finding of unconstitutionality. In so holding, the court observed that essentially, defendant demonstrated little more than mere nonenforcement of the statute against others similarly situated. The conscious exercise of some selectivity in enforcement was not in itself a federal constitutional violation. The court further observed that even though the statistics might have implied a policy of selective enforcement, it was not stated that the selection was deliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preliminarily to any trial of this prosecution of defendant for using her one-family residence as a two-family residence in violation of the city's zoning ordinance, the court has held a hearing to enable defendant to sustain her burden of proving her allegations that the city's Building Department has unconstitutionally discriminated against her in instituting three prosecutions against her in less than a year while most other violators have remained immune from prosecution or have been allowed time by the department to comply while this defendant has been given no such consideration by the department, and that therefore her motion to dismiss this prosecution should be granted.  The court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  finds, after a three-day hearing, that, although the Building Department has no system, plan or pattern for detecting and prosecuting such violations, there has been no invidious, arbitrary or clearly intentional discrimination against this defendant.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant, who is employed as a store clerk and substitute counter clerk by Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., a mail-order department store, is accused of selling &quot;a Sears &amp; Roebuck slide action BB gun&quot; to a person less than 16 years of age, to wit, a 13-year-old boy, in violation of the Penal Law ( &sect; 1898, subd. 5; &sect; 1897, subd. 4).  The information by a State Police investigator is sworn &quot;upon information and belief, the basis for which being police investigation, oral statement of defendant and attached deposition of&quot; the boy.

The information is dismissed, on the following grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The boy is an accomplice of the defendant (Penal Law, &sect; 1897, subd. 4) and hence his deposition cannot support the policeman's information (Code Crim. Pro., &sect;&sect; 148, 399).</SPAN></P>

It cannot be said that defendant clerk -- rather than Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. -- &quot;sold&quot; the gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The information and deposition do not allege that this was an &quot;air-gun, spring-gun, or other instrument or weapon in which the propelling force is a spring or air&quot;, nor do they allege that this was a &quot;weapon in or upon which any loaded or blank cartridges may be used&quot; or that the defendant delivered to the boy any &quot;cartridges or ammunition therefor&quot; (Penal Law, &sect; 1897, subd. 4).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff town citizen instituted an action seeking a declaratory judgment that the apportionment of defendant county board of supervisors was unconstitutional under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One supervisor represented each town on the board. The court declared that the apportionment of the county supervisors was unconstitutional as the eight smallest towns representing approximately 30 percent of the county's population constituted a majority on the board. Recognizing that the board's malapportionment, the board instituted a &quot;weighted voting plan&quot; directly proportional to each town's population. The court also found this plan unconstitutional as it did not provide that the vote of any citizen was approximately equal in weight to that of any other citizen. In so holding, the court observed that a block of 125 votes assigned to the most populous town under the plan gave it the opportunity to cast the decisive vote 19.61 percent of the time. As the plan overweighted the town's vote inequitably over that of the other towns, the plan constituted invidious discrimination in violation of the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Wayne County consists of 15 towns.  Their populations, according to a special 1966 census, range from 1,570 (Town of Huron) to 12,544 (Town of Arcadia); yet each town elects one Supervisor on the 15-man Board of Supervisors. This is unconstitutional inequality.  Each resident of the county is entitled to be equally represented on the county's legislative body (U. S. Const., 14th Amdt.; N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 11).  The present Board of Supervisors proposes to weight each Supervisor's vote on the board according to the population of his town, so that, for example, the Supervisor from Huron would cast 16 votes on the board, the Supervisor from Arcadia 125 votes, etc., and thus the 15 Supervisors would cast 713 votes in all.  A digital computer analysis of this proposal shows that the Supervisor from Arcadia could cast the decisive vote in 19.61% of different voting situations on the board, and the Supervisor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from Huron only 2.148%, etc.  This plan is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In one of the towns is the Newark State School, consisting of 2,620 patients, only 115 of whom are residents of this county.  All of the 2,620 patients have been duly committed as mental defectives and are therefore ineligible to vote (Election Law, &sect; 152, subd. 6).  None of them should be added to the population of the town for the purpose of electing and apportioning town Supervisors.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission had designated buildings maintained by the trustees for retired seamen landmarks. The trustees had made plans to demolish the old buildings to construct new, modern facilities. The trustees challenged the constitutionality of the commission's actions and the enabling legislation found in New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 207-8.0(2). The court found that the commission's designations, under the authority of &sect; 207-8.0(2), imposed a great burden on the trustees. The undue burden amounted to an unlawful taking of the property without just compensation. The location of the building on the harbor was a good area for retired seamen. The restraint placed on the trustees prevented them from using the property to its best advantage. The court further found that there was no relation between the designation and the public health, safety, and general welfare.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner, trustees of a charitable corporation operating, under a testamentary trust, a home for elderly mariners on Staten Island called &quot;The Sailors' Snug Harbor&quot;, has made plans to construct new modern buildings to replace four ancient dormitory buildings presently occupied by about 200 retired seamen. However, the Landmarks Preservation Commission has designated the Harbor's buildings as landmarks, thus prohibiting petitioner from altering or demolishing them without Commission approval (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect;&sect; 207-5.0, 207-6.0), and requiring petitioner, at the risk of criminal sanctions, to maintain them in good repair. To obtain a certificate of appropriateness permitting demolition petitioner, as a tax-exempt owner, must establish execution of an agreement to sell the buildings or to lease them for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a term greater than 20 years, contingent on approval of demolition by the Commission, (Administrative Code, &sect; 207-8.0, subd. a, par. [2]).  Petitioner also would have to show that the buildings were not suitable for carrying out the purposes of the Harbor and would not yield a reasonable return if not tax-exempt. Although the State and city have power to take reasonable steps to prevent destruction of buildings having a civic, educational or cultural value, the burden imposed upon petitioner exceeds the limits of reasonable regulation, prevents petitioner from utilizing the land to its best advantage, and amounts to an unlawful taking of property without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

The State prosecuted defendant under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1425(16). After trial, defendant filed a motion to dismiss. Defendant argued that the statute violated among other things his constitutional right to free speech.

The court held that the structures constituted a contemptuous use of the flag. The court further held that defendant had cast contempt upon the flag by exhibiting the structures. The court held that the structures were not protected. The court further found that the statute was not so vague as to violated the due process clause of the 14th Amendment.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At an art gallery, 13 three-dimensional so-called &quot;protest art constructions&quot; were displayed, two of which &quot;publicly mutilate, deface, defile * * * or cast contempt upon&quot; the American flag, in violation of the Penal Law ( &sect; 1425, subd. 16, par. d).  The art dealer is found guilty of violating said statute.  One &quot;construction&quot; is an American flag stuffed in a shape suggesting a human body hanging from a noose; the other is a cross with a bishop's mitre on the headpiece and with ecclesiastical flags wrapped around the arms and, on the vertical portion, an American flag wrapped around a form suggesting a phallus. This is not an &quot;ornamental picture&quot; within the exceptions in the statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant property owner sought review of the decision issued by the appellate court (New York), which reversed a decision rendered in favor of the property owner in an action concerning appropriation of the property owner's land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This was a claim for the appropriation of the property owner's land. A ruling was issued for the property owner, the state appealed, and the judgment in favor of the property owner was reversed and a new trial was granted. The appellate court, in reversing the original decision, did so in part on the lack of evidence relative to a probability of zoning change, residential to industrial. The property owner contended that the zoning amendment, which changed the subject property from unclassified to residential, was invalid and null and void. The court held that after examining the zoning maps, it had to conclude that the subject property was in an unclassified zone in 1955 that permitted an industrial use. The court also stated the property owner's property could have been valued with an enhancement for probable industrial use. However, the court also stated that the proof before the court was that the property owner's right of way was restricted to farm use. In the interest of justice, the court directed that the trial be reopened on testimony pertaining to farm value and the practice of railroad companies, particularly the company in ownership of the right of way.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled in favor of the state in proceedings concerning the appropriation of the property owner's land.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent domain -- compensation -- claimant's land properly valued on basis of industrial use where zoning change to residential use was held invalid -- State could not, by taking more land than needed for highway, prevent enhancement of value of property by proximity of land to Thruway interchange -- moreover, chapter of law which authorized greater taking than needed for highway may be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- trial reopened for purpose of considering value based on industrial use and for considering probability that railroad over whose tracks claimant has right of way in nature of farm crossing, may make agreement with claimant to increase use of crossing for industrial purposes -- despite long interval between filing of map and service thereof on claimant, interest is limited to six months after filing of map -- judicial notice not taken of expert testimony shown in another trial as to amount of borrowed fill to be taken from claimant's land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Claimant's property, when taken by the State by the filing of an appropriation map in 1955, was in an unclassified zone which permitted an industrial use. The 1954 zoning amendment which changed the subject property from unclassified&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to Residential B was held null and void in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Soron Realty Co. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Town of Geddes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (23 A D 2d 165). Accordingly, claimant's property could be valued with an enhancement for probable industrial use. It is proper to consider sales for industrial purposes in this area in relation to its fair market value before the appropriation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Claimant's land was appropriated pursuant to section 30 of the Highway Law as amended by chapter 797 of the Laws of 1953.  An examination of such statute and an exhibit indicates that the State never intended to use claimant's property for highway purposes but intended to make it available to the county for park purposes.  Moreover, the State's improved highway does not come close to the subject property which was declared surplus and conveyed in 1960 to the county.  By lumping together in one statute a present public highway use and a future public park use, the State seeks to prevent the landowner from obtaining fair market value predicated upon the proximity of claimant's land to an important interchange of the Thruway.  Value may be considered as enhanced by the property's proximity to the Thruway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Chapter 797 of the Laws of 1953 which premeditated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  taking more land than needed may be unconstitutional and violative of section 7 of article I of the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Claimant's property was landlocked and access to it came from a farm crossing across a railroad right of way. Claimant's right of way across the railroad tracks was restricted to a farm use.  The reasonable probability, if any, of obtaining a private agreement from the railroad to increase the crossing user from farming to industrial is a subject of proof about which none was given.  In the interests of justice, the trial is ordered reopened for testimony on (1) farm value, predicated on comparable sales, and damage; and (2) the practice of railroad companies, particularly the railroad which owns the land, relative to the possibility of an increased user, by private agreement, from farm use to industrial use of land adjacent to railroad tracks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Despite the long interval between the date of filing of the appropriation map on January 6, 1955 and personal service of said map on claimant on December 7, 1959, she is not entitled to interest during that period but only for the six-month period from January 6, 1955 and the period after December 2, 1961 to the date of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  entry of the judgment herein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Judicial notice may not be taken of testimony of an expert witness in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Winkelman Co. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> State of New York</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (17 Misc 2d 418) as to the amount of borrowed fill which claimant there could have removed from the property of claimant here.  Claimant's land was intact in January 1967 and claimant could easily have obtained expert testimony relative to borrowed fill. In any event it is academic since claimant's appraiser did not seek to testify to the enhancing value of borrow deposits and this prior expert testimony was proffered after said appraiser had completed his testimony.  </SPAN></P>

The phrase &quot;visible means of support&quot; does not require resort to unlawful means prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  Neglect to seek employment is one of the conditions for charge and conviction but the compulsion to be free from neglect does not produce involuntary servitude in the context of the Thirteenth Amendment.

Defendant claimed that the indictment was void as the grand jury finding the indictment had no legal authority to inquire into the crimes charged, that the grand jury was improperly constituted and convened, and that the July grand jury was not extended by court order into August.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In November of 1965, the county judge submitted an order to the Appellate Division of the Second Department designating and appointing the 1966 criminal and grand jury terms. The appellate division kept the order and filed it in the county clerk's office in February 1967. The court held that N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 190-c was complied with for the year 1966 as filing was an administrative function resting with the appellate division. Advance filing under &sect; 190-e was no longer necessary to create jurisdiction in the court as long as there was compliance with &sect; 190-c and N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 45, and as long as the appointment and designation of terms was subsequently filed pursuant to N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 190-e. Even if the late filing deprived the court of jurisdiction when the July grand jury was convened, that did provide a basis for a dismissal of the indictment. Accordingly, defendant's claim that the indicting grand jury was not a grand jury because there was no July term of county court was denied. As &sect; 190-c(3) authorized a county judge to continue each term as long as deemed necessary, the July grand jury was properly in session in August when the indictment was found and presented.</SPAN></P>

This order was filed in the Dutchess County Clerk's office in February, 1967 -- properly even if late.  The July Grand Jury did not recess; it properly found indictments in August and early September.  Defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment which the Grand Jury found against him on August 15, 1966, on the asserted ground that the Grand Jury was not then properly in session, is denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was questioned by a police officer in the office of the school principal with the principal and a teacher present. He did not notify the juvenile's parents of the interrogation, and he did not advise the juvenile that anything he said might be used against him at the time of the court hearing or that he might have an attorney represent him at the time of the questioning. Three days later, the juvenile was questioned again, this time in the presence of one parent. At trial, the juvenile's counsel objected to the admission of the second purported confession. The court granted the motion and excluded both confessions. Denying the juvenile counsel and protection of his parent made his first statement inadmissible whether or not they were made voluntarily. The first confession violated the requirements of due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution as set forth in Miranda. In the mind of a 12-year-old, there was no difference between the circumstances and the subject matter of the questions asked at the first confession and the second confession. The relation was so close that the one confession controlled the other.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 12-year-old schoolboy was questioned by a police officer in the presence of a teacher and the school principal in said principal's office, without any prior notification to the boy's parents.  The boy admitted that he had broken about 53 windows of the school on the day before.  Three days after this improper questioning (Family Ct. Act, &sect; 724; U. S. Const., 14th Amdt.) the boy signed a similar confession in the presence of his mother after the police officer read to the boy a full list of his rights.  This made an empty form of due process.  Undoubtedly the boy thought that he was being called in with his mother to repeat the same story he had told earlier under unconstitutional pressures.  Both confessions shall be excluded from evidence.  </SPAN></P>

The court denied the motion to dismiss the indictment and for production of the documents, holding that the challenged sections of the Judiciary Law were not pertinent to the issue sought to be raised. The first two related solely to New York City and the last was a form for a proposed questionnaire. The unsupported charges of dereliction on the part of the public official were insufficient to overcome the presumption that those charged with the administration of justice performed their duties properly. There was not one iota of fact to be found in the affidavit, even as to the sources of the information and belief.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 381(6) for operating his motorcycle without a helmet. Defendant appeared in court to respond to the charge and alleged that the statute was unconstitutional. The court agreed, dismissing the charge against defendant. The court held that N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 381(6), which required the operator of a motorcycle to wear a protective helmet, was unconstitutional as applied to defendant because it was not sufficiently definite to sustain a criminal conviction, and because the state's police power did not authorize statutes requiring a citizen to protect his own physical well-being. The court found that the police power traditionally did not include the power to make a citizen protect his own physical well-being and that to have held otherwise would have enlarged the police power beyond traditional limits. The court found that there has been no regulation for the sole purpose of making a state's citizens protect their own physical well-being so that others may have benefitted from it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Vehicle and Traffic Law ( &sect; 381, subds. 6, 9, eff. Jan. 1, 1967) makes it &quot;unlawful * * * for any person to operate or ride upon a motorcycle unless he wears a protective helmet of a type approved by the commissioner.  Such a helmet must be equipped with either a neck or chin strap and be reflectorized on both sides thereof.  The commissioner is hereby authorized and empowered to adopt and amend regulations covering the types of helmets and the specifications therefor and to establish and maintain a list of approved helmets which meet the specifications as established hereunder&quot; (subd. 6); and makes it unlawful &quot;to sell, offer for sale or distribute any protective helmets, goggles or face shields for use by the operators of motorcycles, or protective helmets for the use of passengers thereon, unless they are of a type and specification approved by the commissioner and appear on the list of approved devices maintained by the commissioner&quot; (subd. 9).  The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Commissioner of Motor Vehicles has promulgated regulations ( 15 NYCRR Part 54) which apparently are directed only to the manufacturers and sellers and not to the wearers of helmets. While subdivision 9 of section 381 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, which is directed to manufacturers and sellers, is undoubtedly valid, subdivision 6 which applies to persons who &quot;operate or ride upon a motorcycle&quot; is unconstitutional and void, for two reasons: (a) a person cannot be required to make an unreasonable effort to find out just what he is forbidden to do under criminal penalties; and (b) a person cannot be required, under the police power and criminal penalties, to protect himself by means which do not affect the safety of other persons.  Therefore, the charge against defendant motorcyclist of violating subdivision 6 of section 381 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

The motorcyclist filed a claim with the city comptroller's office and brought an action for damages. The court found in favor of the motorcyclist. It held that his damages were caused solely by the negligence of the city, and that he was not guilty of contributory negligence by virtue of violating a traffic regulation since that violation was not the proximate cause of the damages. The court awarded $ 117 in damages to the motorcycle but denied the motorcyclist's claim for lost income. While the city was authorized to tow away illegally parked motor vehicles, it had to do so in a reasonably prudent manner under the circumstances. The authority to tow did not give the city the license to destroy by neglect or otherwise. The city had never instructed the particular tow truck crew as to the proper way to tow a motorcycle. To justify their actions, there would have had to have been a showing of a specific emergency beyond a generally difficult traffic situation. At the time, the motorcycle did not create any obstruction than a utility bin next to it.</SPAN></P>

The proper binding is a cable or strap or net and precautions should be taken to prevent the motorcycle from swinging against the body of the truck. Plaintiff is awarded $ 117.73 damages to his motorcycle. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator, an inmate in a state prison, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that the hearing procedure used by the parole board at his parole revocation hearing violated the Due Process and Right to Counsel Clauses of the New York and United States Constitutions. Respondent was the warden of the prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator was released on parole after serving part of a sentence for second degree manslaughter. He was declared delinquent as of a day later for failure to report to his parole officer. Following extradition proceedings in New Jersey, he was returned to prison. The parole board held a hearing with respect to the alleged violation of parole, determined that relator was a parole violator, and remanded him to serve the balance of his sentence. Relator claimed that the board's refusal to permit him to have counsel at the hearing violated his constitutional rights. The court denied the writ, holding that under N.Y. Correct. Law &sect; 218, he was not entitled to counsel at the parole hearing. The procedure did not contravene relator's constitutional right to counsel. Relator was guaranteed counsel in all criminal prosecutions. His guilt or innocence had been determined at trial. The parole revocation hearing was held only to determine whether or not relator had violated the terms of his parole and whether he should be returned to prison. Because relator left the State without permission and did not report to his parole officer it affirmatively appeared that he violated his parole.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A petition for a writ of habeas corpus is defective for failure to annex thereto a copy of the mandate by which relator is detained as required by CPLR 7002 (subd.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant was released on parole and then violated the conditions of his parole. At the hearing called by the Parole Board pursuant to section 218 of the Correction Law, the Parole Board followed the mandate of the statute in not permitting relator to be represented by counsel and he was not deprived of any right under the Federal and State Constitutions thereby.  A parole violation hearing is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not a criminal prosecution and no right to counsel exists in favor of the parole violator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Town of Henrietta sought a declaratory judgment that defendant property owner violated the town's Zoning Ordinance by operating a boarding or rooming house in an area zoned for single-family residential use and an injunction against using the property for any purpose except those set forth in the applicable sections of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner, a bachelor, lived in a house in a district zoned for single-family residential use with three to seven other young men, all but one of whom were bachelors. The other residents of the house paid a share for the upkeep of the property. The town sought a declaratory judgment that the use violated Henrietta, N.Y. Zoning Ordinance, and an injunction against such use of the property. The property owner contended that his use conformed to the ordinance, and that the ordinance was unconstitutional as to him. The court granted the relief requested by the town. The court held that the language of permissive occupation of such property as a &quot;single family dwelling&quot; under the ordinance could not have properly been construed as intended to sanction the use being made by defendant under the collective economic arrangement. The court concluded that the property owner's status was similar to a boarding house keeper, notwithstanding the ingenious form of his economic arrangement. Considering the ordinary and commonly accepted meaning of the term &quot;single family dwelling&quot; in light of the objectives of the ordinance such an approach was unrealistic and without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared that the property owner's premises were being used in violation of the town ordinance, granted the town's request for an injunction against keeping, maintaining, and operating and using the premises for a boarding house or rooming house, or any purposes except those set forth in the ordinance. The court noted that the relief did not bar the property owner from seeking a zoning variance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff town is granted judgment enjoining defendant, a bachelor, from using his house, which is situated in a one-family dwelling zone, as a boarding house or rooming house. He collects from each of three to seven young men who reside with him monthly amounts for payments towards the mortgage, taxes, insurance, maintenance, and interior furnishings, and for the cost, apparently without any profit, of food, beer and entertainment. Each member of this group pays to defendant $ 75 a month plus an equal part of any monthly deficiency.  Defendant keeps three or four automobiles on the premises, and the other members of the group usually keep about three more automobiles on the premises.  This is not a single family dwelling use; rather, it is a use as a boarding house or rooming house in violation of the zoning ordinance. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants filed a motion to suppress tangible evidence and admissions allegedly obtained from them by police during the course of a raid made without a warrant upon a multiple-dwelling residence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers positioned themselves on the fire escape of a multiple-dwelling residence and observed through a window what they believed to be drug trafficking activities in defendants' apartment. After alerting other officers, the observing officers turned the doorknob to the apartment and the door opened from within, revealing no indication of any illegal activity, and the officers went to the bedroom to search it. Defendants filed a motion to suppress the contraband seized and admissions subsequently obtained, claiming that such resulted from an illegal trespass within the curtilage of the apartment, which made the search, seizure, and arrests of defendants unconstitutional. The court granted the motion, holding that the observations surreptitiously made by the officers from the fire escape, which created the probable cause to search, were made in the course of a trespass upon the curtilage of the apartment and were thus illegal, probable cause having been illegally acquired. The court found that the officers' entrance into the apartment without a warrant was illegal and violative of the Fourth Amendment and thus all evidence and admissions obtained thereby were suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendants' motion to suppress all the contraband seized and admissions obtained by the police in an illegal search of defendants' apartment, but denied with leave to renew at trial the portion of the motion seeking an inspection of the grand jury minutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- unlawful searches and seizures and admissions -- fire escape adjoining apartment window is appurtenance or curtilage of residentially leased premises; officers who, without any warrant or probable cause, peered into window from fire escape were illegally searching apartment by trespass; any packaging of heroin they thus saw could not furnish reasonable cause for their subsequent entry and search of apartment; contraband which they seized in such raid is ordered suppressed from evidence -- admissions obtained from defendants in apartment are ordered suppressed, since they were not warned of their constitutional rights while in custody prior to formal arrest -- insufficient warning was given to defendant who made written statement, hence it too is suppressed -- arrests occurred prior to June 13, 1966, but this hearing took place after that date -- at trial defendants may renew their motion to inspect Grand Jury minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Without a search warrant, and apparently without any preceding probable cause, law-enforcement&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  officers surreptitiously unlatched the roof door of a multiple dwelling and entered upon the roof and went down the fire escape and, from the fire escape, peered into the recessed window of the bona fide residential apartment of 2 of the 15 subsequently arrested defendants.  This constituted an unauthorized search by trespass of whatever they could see.  The Multiple Dwelling Law ( &sect; 53) indicates that the portion of a fire escape adjoining an apartment window is a necessary appurtenance of the apartment; hence it constitutes part of the curtilage of the residentially leased premises.  The officers saw several women apparently putting heroin into bags; but since this evidence was obtained by the officers by an illegal trespass, it could not lawfully furnish reasonable cause for the officers' subsequent actions.  The officers went around to the front door of the apartment and drew their guns and turned the knob of the apartment door, and thereupon the door opened. They entered the apartment and saw nothing illegal in view.  They then went into the rear bedroom and searched there.  Thus, by means of illegal trespasses they found and seized contraband.  Such searches and seizures and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the subsequent arrests of the defendants violated the defendants' rights under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  The physical evidence seized in this raid is therefore ordered suppressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Oral admissions made in the apartment by the 2 tenants and by 5 of the other defendants, all of whom were already in custody prior to their formal arrest, were obtained as the result of the officers' illegal trespass and their illegal failure to warn the defendants that they had the right to remain silent and to have a lawyer present, etc., as set forth in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Miranda </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Arizona</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (384 U.S. 436, decided June 13, 1966); and a written statement was taken from 1 defendant after he had been insufficiently warned.  These arrests were made prior to June 13, 1966; but this hearing has been held since that date.  All of the statements are ordered suppressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendants' motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes is denied but it may be renewed at the trial.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with violating the Sabbath Law, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 2147, when he sold two bottles of gas line antifreeze on a Sunday. The district attorney moved to withdraw the charge when he found that defendant and other merchants had begun to observe the Sabbath Law. Defendant refused to join in the motion, instead requesting that the district attorney specify which items could be sold on a Sunday. When the district attorney declined to do so, defendant filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that it was impossible to discern from &sect; 2147 which items could be sold on a Sunday. In denying defendant's motion, the court pointed out that &sect; 2147 permitted gasoline to be sold on a Sunday but held that gas line antifreeze, although made from petroleum, was not a gasoline product. The court stated that the exceptions to &sect; 2147 were to be narrowly construed so as to give credence to New York's stated public policy of setting aside Sunday as a day of repose.</SPAN></P>

The Legislature left the decision of what type of helmet would be approved to the will of the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles of the State of New York. Accordingly, the court found that &sect; 381(6) was too indefinite. The court held that laws had to be so explicit that all men subject to their penalties knew what acts it was their duty to avoid. It was definite that such a &quot;protective helmet&quot; be equipped with a neck or chinstrap and further that it must be &quot;reflectorized&quot; on both sides. The motorist had no other warning of what he had to wear, except that the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles had to approve it. It became incumbent upon the operator or rider, to obtain somewhere, a list of approved helmets, and the list had to be kept current because the Commissioner could amend the list. Furthermore, the statute did not require this stated safety device for the purpose of protecting other users of the highways from injuries or damage; it simply removed from the individual the right to exercise his judgment, or preference, in the use of personal adornment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county board of supervisors filed a motion for approval of a local law adopting a reapportionment plan for the composition of the board in an action by plaintiffs, town, town board, and citizens' groups, challenging the plan on the ground that it denied to the county's citizens equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county was composed of 18 towns and six cities, which had different population levels. Each town had one representative on the county's board of supervisors, with each member having one vote with equal voting power. The town filed an action alleging that this system caused an inequity in representation that violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and New York Constitutions.The court granted summary judgment in favor of the town, declaring the apportionment of voting power in the board was unconstitutional. The board adopted a reapportionment plan and filed a motion seeking approval of the local law incorporating the plan. The court denied the motion and declared the law to be unconstitutional. The court held that the law's combination of weighted voting and multimember electoral districts failed to provide substantially equal population-based representation to the voters under the &quot;one person, one vote&quot; principle, which resulted in invidious discrimination that was prohibited by the Equal Protection Clauses. In other respects, the court held that unconstitutionality of the reapportionment law had not been sufficiently demonstrated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The total number of residents in a district -- not merely the number of residents who were registered as voters in any preceding election -- is the number which must be counted in order to determine that each resident of that district has no more&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or less than one vote as compared with any resident of any other district.  Therefore, a local law reapportioning the Supervisors who comprise a county Board of Supervisors is adjudged unconstitutional, on the ground that the ward lines for the election of supervisors in two of the cities are based on the number of registered voters only and that it appears that this error could result in variances of as much as 95%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In all other respects, the right of the people to the equal protection of the laws (U. S. Const., 14th Amdt.; N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 11), which right is summarized in the phrase &quot;one person, one vote&quot;, is not basically violated by the method which this local law proposes to use to apportion the population of the county.  This method keeps, as district lines, the lines of the 18 towns and the lines of 4 of the cities and the ward lines of the other 2 cities, all of which have different populations, but provides that different numbers of legislators shall be elected at large from each of said districts, and further provides that the voting power exercised at meetings of the board by the legislators from the different districts shall be weighted so as to give the total&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of 54 legislators a total of 861 votes on the board, and so that each of said 861 votes at meetings of the board shall represent approximately 991 residents of the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. This local law has been enacted by the current Board of Supervisors under the powers granted to them by the Constitution and the Municipal Home Rule Law and in conformity with the Town Law and the Westchester County Charter and the Westchester County Administrative Code.  No unconstitutional discrimination, of sufficient substance to require annulment by the judicial branch of government, results (a) from the local law's failure to allow the residents of the incorporated villages to elect representatives other than their town representatives, or (b) from the local law's requirement that the town legislators be real property owners as provided in the Town Law ( &sect; 23) for Supervisors, even though the Supervisors or legislators from the cities need not be real property owners since none of the city Charters requires it.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landlord brought a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding, seeking review of a determination by respondent, city rent and rehabilitation administrator, that the landlord's housing accommodations did not qualify for rent decontrol. The administrator found that the conversion from a rooming house to &quot;self-contained family units&quot; was not timely and that the units failed to meet the regulatory requirements to qualify for decontrol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord owned rental property that he originally used as a rooming house. The rent control regulations in existence at the time provided that, if a rooming house was a slum, it was subject to rent control. Although the landlord contested that determination, another trial court previously found for the administrator. The landlord subsequently converted the property to &quot;self-contained family units&quot; and contended that the property was no longer in such a condition to be a slum and requested that it be decontrolled. The administrator found that the regulations had changed and that all rooming houses were subject to rent control and that the conversion did not meet the regulatory standards for conversion to qualify for decontrol. The court held that the housing accommodations created by conversion from rooming house accommodations could not qualify for decontrol under applicable regulations. The court concluded that there was sufficient ground in the record to support the administrator's determination that the housing accommodations were not converted before the regulatory deadline and that the &quot;self-contained family units&quot; did not meet the statutory requirements for decontrol.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and tenant -- rent regulation -- conversion of 12-room rooming house into 10 small apartments, completed after April 30, 1962, does not entitle landlord to decontrol (N.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A landlord altered and converted a 12-room rooming house into a 10-family apartment house containing a total of approximately 20 rooms.  The New York City Rent and Rehabilitation Administrator fixed the maximum rents of the apartments at the rentals agreed upon in the leases, and refused to decontrol the house.  Such refusal of decontrol was proper, because (a) the conversion was not completed until &quot;after April 30, 1962&quot;, (b) the conversion has not &quot;resulted in additional housing accommodations consisting of self-contained family units&quot;, and (c) only 1 or 2&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the 10 apartments contains the required &quot;minimum total area of 395 square feet exclusive of the area of bathrooms and closets.&quot; (N.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the time that the property owners' land was conditionally rezoned in the highway business district, the town enacted an interim development law prohibiting the issuance of any building permits within the areas where zoning changes were contemplated until the effective date of the 1966 comprehensive amendment to the zoning law. The town board thereafter denied a variance for the construction of an automobile sales and service agency on the property owners' land. The court held that the interim zoning law was valid because (1) a locality could enact reasonable interim legislation prohibiting the commencement of construction for a reasonable time during consideration of proposed zoning changes; (2) the happening of the event that would terminate the stop-gap ordinance was determinable given that the 1966 comprehensive amendment had to be passed before December 31, 1966, and that the effective date of the amendment was 10 days after publication and posting of the same; and (3) the town board could issue special permits during the freeze period.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The owners of a parcel of land which was zoned for residence and offices and special industries executed and recorded an agreement with the town in 1960 whereby the land was rezoned for highway business uses but upon certain conditions and restrictions, including the condition that the zoning would revert to its former classification, after publication and posting ( Town Law, &sect; 265), if construction were not begun within two years.  The agreement further provided that it could be modified by consent of both parties, and that it would expire in 20 years or upon the town's adoption of a comprehensive change in zoning, whichever occurred first.  The owners were subsequently granted extensions until November 25, 1966 of the original two-year limit within which to commence construction.  In May, 1966, they contracted to sell a portion of the land to an automobile sales and service&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  agency.  Meantime the town was preparing, with the aid of State and Federal agencies, a master plan for a comprehensive change in its entire zoning ordinance; and on June 2, 1966 and subsequently, the town enacted local laws prohibiting the issuance of any building permits within the areas, constituting some three fourths of the town, wherein changes were to be made by the master plan.  Said plan was adopted as a comprehensive zoning ordinance on July 26, 1966, effective on December 31, 1966.  Said local law further provided that, in the interim, any application to vary or modify the law's application as to any property would be referred to the town's Planning Board for a report as to the effect on the master plan, and that thereupon the Town Board would make a determination in its absolute legislative discretion. Pursuant to these provisions, and since the master plan would rezone this parcel as residential, the Town Board lawfully, constitutionally and properly denied the owners' application for a variance for an automobile sales and service building.  </SPAN></P>

The town residents who did not own realty argued that &sect; 3-316, and N.Y. Village Law art. 3 were discriminatory, and as such, violated the equal protection clauses of both the N.Y. Const. and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. In ordering the complaint dismissed, the court held that N.Y. Village Law art. 3 was constitutional. In so ruling, the court stressed the presumption of constitutionality accorded statutes, and found that the residents failed to make any factual showing that there was no reasonable basis for the qualification that only realty owners could vote in incorporation elections. The court also rejected the claim that the real property ownership qualification hinged upon one's wealth.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, county social workers, brought an article 78 proceeding on behalf of themselves and all other persons similarly situated, seeking to compel respondent county to grant them a salary increase pursuant to &sect; 79-a of the Social Welfare Law, 1965 N.Y. Law 400.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county contended that &sect; 79(a), which required the county to increase the salaries of social workers with graduate training, was invalid and unconstitutional. The court disagreed. The salary advantage provided for under &sect; 79-a did not constitute a promotion within the meaning and intent of N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 52(9); but even if it did, there was nothing in the constitution which prohibited the legislature from amending the Civil Service Law to the extent necessary to permit favored treatment to trained personnel. The term &quot;other social service personnel&quot; was not vague. Salaries paid to employees of local welfare departments were a matter of state concern, and consequently, the legislation in question was an exception to the home rule provisions. Section 79(a) of the Social Welfare Law on its face applied in like manner to all political subdivisions of the state and did not arbitrarily single out a particular community. The state department's failure to act and to implement the statute would not result in a denial to qualified persons of the statutory benefits. Employees who completed the necessary graduate training were entitled to the relief sought.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the relief requested by the county social workers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil service -- case workers -- compensation -- salary increase granted to case workers and social service workers who have graduate training by Social Welfare Law (&sect; 79-a) is not promotion -- section 79-a not vague in defining those entitled to increase or amount thereof -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> does not violate home rule provisions of Constitution -- section is general law -- petitioners employed as case workers and supervisors are those intended to be benefited -- approval of &quot;suitable graduate training&quot; must be granted by local welfare department -- no difficulty in determining whether employee has required qualifications -- county does not have satisfactory alternative plan in lieu of higher salaries -- employees who have completed necessary graduate training are entitled to relief; issue as to whether any petitioner has completed training will be set down for trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 79-a was added to the Social Welfare Law and provides higher salaries (10% for one year of graduate training and 20% for two years) for case workers and other social service personnel employed by a local welfare department &quot;who have suitable graduate training approved by the department&quot;.  The salary increase&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  provided by said section does not constitute a promotion within the meaning and intent of subdivision 9 of section 52 of the Civil Service Law. Even if it did, the Constitution does not prohibit the Legislature from amending the law to the extent necessary to permit favored treatment of trained personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The statute is not vague in defining those entitled to the increase or the amount thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The statute does not violate the home rule provisions of the Constitution.  Salaries paid to employees of local welfare departments are a matter of State concern and therefore the legislation is an exception to such provisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The section is a general law applying to all political subdivisions of the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. While the statute contemplates that the State Department of Social Welfare will adopt rules for carrying out some of the provisions of the statute, petitioners are employed as social case workers and supervisors and are those whom the Legislature intended to benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The approval of &quot;suitable graduate training&quot; as required under the statute must be granted not by the State Department of Social Welfare but by the local welfare department, to which the word &quot;department&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as used in the statute refers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Whether an employee has &quot;suitable graduate training&quot; is not so vague as to require further definition.  &quot;Suitable&quot; means training in the specialized field of social work.  The local welfare department should have no difficulty in determining whether a person meets the required qualifications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The county does not have a satisfactory alternative plan in lieu of the higher salaries. The statute expressly requires that the proposed alternative plan be submitted to the State Department of Social Welfare for approval.  There is no evidence that any alternative plan has ever been approved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Employees who have completed the necessary graduate training are entitled to the relief sought.  If there is any issue between the parties as to whether any of the petitioners has completed such training, a hearing will be had to resolve the issue.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two proceedings under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, consolidated for purposes of disposition, petitioners, the employees of the Department of Public Welfare of Suffolk County and the Department of Social Welfare of Erie County, sought to require respondent employers to provide salary increases. The employers filed a motion to dismiss the petitions for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute grounds for the relief sought.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees argued that they were entitled to salary increased in accordance with N.Y. Soc. Welf. Law &sect; 79-a. The employers countered that the statute was unconstitutional. The court first determined that the employers had standing to test the constitutionality of the statute in issue. It ruled that the statute was unconstitutional. The granting of a salary increase in the manner proposed by the statute constituted a promotion without first determining merit and fitness by competitive examination. The attempt to achieve that end violated the state constitution. The court ruled that although educational attainment could be used as a qualifying element for admission to a competitive examination, its use as a substitute for competition could not be condoned.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed a special proceeding (New York) under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 4 for relief under N.Y. County Law &sect; 17-A, seeking certain records and information relating to a murder investigation. Respondents in the special proceeding were the district attorney and the county medical examiner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was a defendant in a separate criminal case charging him with murder. Through the special civil proceeding petitioner sought to obtain certain information and records of the medical examiner. The court concluded that petitioner sought to gain disclosure of certain items of evidence in a civil proceeding which he was not entitled to as a defendant in the criminal proceeding. N.Y. County Law &sect; 675(1) provided that the medical examiner had the authority, when necessary in his opinion, to request certain tests. The medical examiner was not required to perform certain tests. Petitioner was unable to obtain an analysis of sheeting allegedly used in the murder, since no such analysis was undertaken, and no such analysis was required. Additionally, under &sect; 675 petitioner was unable to obtain the names of all persons consulted. Petitioner already had in his possession the names of the only witnesses who were present at the time of the investigation at the scene of the death. The medical examiner was not compelled to furnish to petitioner the transcripts of any testimony of witnesses examined by the medical examiner, and the request was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- medical examiner's reports -- indicted defendant, who has been given copy of autopsy report and Medical Examiner's report of investigation made at scene where body was found, is not entitled to transcripts of testimony of any witnesses or to reports of any analyses of sheeting which was found tied around victim's neck -- lack of preliminary hearing before indictment does not entitle defendant to disclosure of evidence -- indicted defendant cannot obtain disclosure of evidence by means of civil proceeding (under CPLR, art. 4, and County Law, art. 17-A).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The County Law (art. 17-A, &sect; 677, subd. 3, par. [b]) provides that the records of the Medical Examiner of the county are open to inspection by the District Attorney but that any other interested person must obtain a court order.  This statute does not change the principle of criminal law that an indicted defendant is not entitled to disclosure of evidence or to statements of witnesses; and this principle of criminal law cannot be evaded by an indicted defendant's instituting a proceeding under the CPLR or under article 17-A of the County Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant has been indicted for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  grand larceny and first degree murder.  The District Attorney has given the defendant a complete copy of the Medical Examiner's autopsy report, which includes the findings of a pathologist, and which indicates that the victim was strangled with a piece of sheeting tied around her neck. Attached to this report is the Medical Examiner's report of his investigation made at the scene (County Law, &sect; 674), which states that the deceased was found by her husband a considerable time after her death, that said husband called the police, and that there were no witnesses at the investigation at the scene except the police, an Assistant District Attorney, the Medical Examiner, and a physician.  The Medical Examiner states that he has not examined any witnesses under oath and that he has not ordered any examinations or analyses of the sheeting or of any other objects (under County Law, &sect;&sect; 674, 675).  Such examinations are discretionary with the Medical Examiner; but even if made, they are not subject to inspection by an indicted defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The fact that there was no preliminary Magistrate's hearing before the indictment does not entitle the defendant to inspect the Grand Jury minutes or to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  inspect the evidence against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Accordingly, defendant's petition against the Medical Examiner and the District Attorney, in the form of a civil proceeding (under CPLR, art. 4, and County Law, art. 17-A), for the names and addresses of all witnesses and for transcripts of their testimony and for reports of all analyses and examinations, is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mail order business filed a defamation action against defendant city. The city filed a counterclaim which sought an injunction, accounting, and damages resulting from misleading advertisements published by the mail order business. The mail order business filed a motion for dismissal of the counterclaim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city alleged that the mail order business refused to file information which resulted in the violation of the provisions of the Jenkins Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 375 et seq., thus encouraging violation of the city and state cigarette use tax provisions. In addition, it was argued that the corporation refused to make collection of cigarette use tax in violation of N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 471 New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; D46-2.0, causing irreparable injury resulting from the misleading of purchasers into the false belief that their purchases were not subject to cigarette tax and rendering the collection of the tax extremely difficult if not impossible. The court found that these allegations made by the city stated a cause of action and refused to dismiss the counterclaim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to dismiss the counterclaim was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- State and city cigarette taxes -- constitutional law -- libel -- fair comment -- any sale by mail from out of State to any New York State or New York City resident of any number of cigarettes, even less than 400, is taxable -- such tax laws are constitutional -- Federal act requiring mail-order sellers to co-operate with State tax authorities is constitutional -- provision in Federal act giving United States courts jurisdiction does not divest State courts of jurisdiction -- statement by New York City Finance Director that North Carolina corporation is bootlegging cigarettes into city is true, or at least is fair comment -- city may maintain counterclaim against North Carolina corporation for injunction, accounting and damages -- New York court has jurisdiction, constitutionally, to subject North Carolina plaintiff to counterclaim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Any out-of-State mail sale of any number of cigarettes to a New York State or New York City resident is subject to the New York State and/or New York City cigarette tax; a sale of 400 cigarettes or less&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is exempt only when the cigarettes are personally brought into this State or city (Tax Law, &sect;&sect; 471, 471-b; Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; D46-2.0).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The State and city cigarette tax laws are constitutional; they are not an unreasonable restraint upon interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Jenkins Act (U.S. Code, tit. 15, &sect; 375 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.), requiring mail-order sellers to file with the taxing States the names and addresses of purchasers and the quantities sold, is constitutional.  The provision giving the United States District Courts jurisdiction to restrain violations of said act (U.S. Code, tit. 15, &sect; 378) is not exclusive; the State courts too have jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. When the New York City Finance Director issued a statement to the newspapers which, when read in full context, asserted that a certain North Carolina mail-order sales corporation was bootlegging cigarettes into New York City and New York State, he uttered truth, or at least fair comment. The corporation's allegation that he spoke maliciously is not enough; it has not shown any malice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Accordingly, summary judgment is granted dismissing the North Carolina corporation's complaint against the City of New York&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the city's Finance Director for damages for defamation; and the court denies the North Carolina corporation's motion to dismiss the counterclaim wherein an injunction and an accounting and damages are sought because of the corporation's violations of the State and city tax laws and the Jenkins Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The New York court has jurisdiction, constitutionally, to subject the North Carolina corporation to the counterclaim, since the corporation's advertisements here and business here constitute sufficient contacts with New York State.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant sought dismissal of the informations arguing that the permits were not necessary because the town's zoning powers did not extend to land owned by a state authority, the ordinance under attack is unconstitutional, and enforcement of the sign ordinance would be an unreasonable interference with interstate commerce. The court denied defendant's motion. The court held that the authority would be subject to the ordinance's regulation of signs in accordance with established standards in that the particular function at issue would be proprietary rather than governmental. The court further held that there was no constitutional infringement in enforcement of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A town's zoning ordinance which limits the size of any billboards and advertising signs and requires a permit from the town for the erection of such signs and the payment of a reasonable fee for such a permit, and imposes criminal penalties for failure to obtain a permit, validly applies to an advertising company which leases land from the Long Island Rail Road Company or from the railroad's statutory successor, the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Authority (Public Authorities Law, &sect;&sect; 1260-1278, as added by L. 1965, ch. 324).  The ordinance does not unconstitutionally limit the State powers or governmental powers or land ownership of the Authority nor does it unreasonably burden national or interstate commerce. The fee for the permit is designed to defray the cost of administering the ordinance. The size of the sign allowed may be appealed to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  town's Zoning Board of Appeals (Town Law, &sect; 267).  Accordingly, in this criminal prosecution of the advertising company for violating the zoning ordinance by failing to obtain permits, such defendant's motion for a dismissal of the information is denied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tenant filed a motion for summary judgment in his action against defendant landlord for wrongful eviction and wrongful taking of personal property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord peacefully evicted the tenant for non-payment of three months of rent. The tenant claimed that he paid the rent prior to the trial date, but the trial court still entered a default judgment against him. In his complaint, the tenant alleged that the landlord also received a warrant to remove the tenant's personal payment for non-payment even though the tenant had paid the rent. Additionally, the tenant maintained that his eviction was unlawful. The landlord contended that the tenant was a statutory tenant and therefore his remedies were limited to the remedies granted in the New York City Rent and Rehabilitation Law. The court held that summary judgment with respect to the tenant's cause of action for wrongful taking of property raised questions of fact and therefore it denied the tenant's motion for summary judgment. The court then granted summary judgment in favor of the landlord, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3212(b), (e), on the wrongful eviction count. The court held that causes of actions under N.Y. Real Prop. Acts Law &sect; 853 applied only where a landlord used force to remove the tenant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Triable issues are presented by the allegations of a statutory residential tenant that the defendants (the landlord and a New York City Marshal), proceeding under an improperly obtained and invalid warrant of dispossess, wrongfully removed the tenant's belongings during the tenant's absence, and that, in the course of such removal or in the course of defendants' placing said&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  belongings in storage, $ 1,500 worth of the tenant's furniture and clothing were broken, lost or stolen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

Plaintiff's further allegations that the defendants &quot;threatened a breach of the peace should plaintiff attempt to re-enter said apartment, and since then have held and still hold forcible possession of said apartment, and hold and keep plaintiff out of said apartment by force or by putting him in fear of personal violence&quot; are merely conclusory.

Notice of the election was published in a weekly newspaper and posted in five places throughout the fire district. In granting the Board's motion, the court held that the taxpayers presented no satisfactory evidence in support of its causes of action that attacked the manner in which the election was conducted and that the first two causes of action, relating to the publication of the notice, were legally insufficient. No proof was submitted to show that ballots were cast by unqualified voters, and there was no contradiction of the Board's affidavit that none of the voters were challenged. A screened off area provided for marking of the ballots afforded sufficient privacy to insure secrecy. The court also examined the notice of election and found its contents gave clear and precise information of the time and place of the election. Finally, the court held that the weekly newspaper met the requirements of N.Y.

The landlord challenged the validity of 25 of the listed violations as arbitrary and capricious. The landlord also challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 302-a, urging that the sanctioned withholding of rents by tenants while they enjoyed the use of property was a denial of property without due process of law. In dismissing the petition, the court held that &sect; 302-a was a constitutional exercise of the state's police powers. It was a means to induce owners of multiple dwellings to maintain and repair the properties. In order to promote the public interest in the maintenance of safe and sanitary housing accommodations, the legislature was warranted in exercising its police powers. Further, the legislation was addressed to a legitimate end and the measures taken were reasonable and appropriate to secure that end.

The taxpayer refused to file the form, to collect the tax from his customers, or to pay to the department the taxes claimed to be due on sales made at his place of business.

The inmate was returned to the institution and, thereafter, was transferred to a state hospital where he spent approximately seven years before being returned to the institution where he was later released under outpatient care. The inmate filed a claim against the state alleging false imprisonment for the time he spent in the state hospital. The court granted the state's motion to dismiss pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3211 and denied the inmate's motion for summary judgment. The court found that it was unable to determine whether the inmate's claim was time-barred because it did not have sufficient evidence to determine whether the inmate fell within the tolling provisions of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 208 after his release from the institution on outpatient care. Nonetheless, the court held that the inmate failed to state a cause of action because his transfer to the state hospital was authorized under N.Y. Correct. Laws &sect; 412. Further, the inmate was not deprived of his freedom by the transfer because he was already committed to the institution and had not objected to the commitment.</SPAN></P>

The previous decision of the court denied certain relief and granted a hearing to determine the legality of various legal processes, including a wiretap order. The court ruled that the wiretap order and affidavit demonstrated the requisite reasonable grounds for the issuance of the said order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion raised significant questions as to the extent of an attack on a judicially authorized wiretap order. The issue was raised because the wiretap order's supporting affidavit stated that the affiant received information from a member of a city police department. The affidavit further alleged that the informant did state that in compliance with a court authorized wiretap he heard the numbers dialed and that another party did answer the call. That the party calling did then relay to the answering party horse bets. Defendants sought to inquire into the legality of the city wiretap order. They contended that if the city wiretap order was illegal, then the fruits of that order were tainted and should not have been used to obtain the county wiretap order. The court noted that the affidavits in support of the instant motion lacked the necessary allegations to warrant a hearing on the ground of perjuriousness. However, in view of the holding that the court would review the legality of the city wiretap order, the product of which was the basis of the county wiretap order, the court directed that the prosecutor furnish it with a copy of the city wiretap order and supporting affidavit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Pursuant to a New York County ex parte order, the New York City police tapped a telephone wire in New York County and heard, among other things, a telephone call to a telephone number in Nassau County which was answered by one &quot;Charles&quot; with whom the New York caller placed a bet on a horse race.

In connection with that motion, the Nassau County Court directs the Nassau County District Attorney to furnish defendants' counsel with a copy of both the New York County and the Nassau County wiretap orders and supporting affidavits.  If the New York County order was issued without &quot;reasonable grounds&quot;, any evidence obtained pursuant to it cannot legally support the Nassau County order authorizing a tap of the telephone of defendant &quot;Charles&quot;.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An administrative order issued by the Commissioner regulated the handling of milk in certain counties. The Commissioner amended the order to provide that the price for certain milk be the higher of either a specified amount or the price established for the New York-New Jersey Milk Marketing Area. The distributors asserted that this action was null and void because the amendment resulted in an unconstitutional delegation of administrative powers in that the formula proposed for setting the prices unlawfully vested price-fixing powers given to the Commissioner in the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States. Although N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 prohibited the delegation of legislative power by an administrative agency, the court held that the amended order did not unconstitutionally delegate the Commissioner's power. The formula merely related to the ultimate determination of a price which was used as an economic factor to establish the variable in the amended order. This factor could have been relied upon by the Commissioner in the formulating of his regulating plan within constitutional limitations.</SPAN></P>

The amendment did not delegate legislative powers (N. Y. Const., art.

The taxpayer filed an action alleging that the sale violated the city charter and the state constitution and that because a portion of the property sold would be used for educational purposes, it was exempt from taxation, thereby increasing the taxes of the taxpayer.

The court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment and held that all auction sales of real property by the city to nonprofit corporations organized for educational and other purposes was expressly authorized by 1966 N.Y.

The candidate claimed that as an orthodox observer of the Jewish Sabbath, eight of the 42 day period for collection of signatures were unavailable to him. The court noted that while eight days may have been unavailable to the candidate, the candidate was able to collect only 99 signatures in the 32 days in which the candidate did work to collect names. The court also rejected the candidate's contention that N.Y. Elec.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. By means of &quot;persistent fraud&quot; and &quot;illegality&quot; (Executive Law, &sect; 63, subd. 12) the respondents (two domestic corporations, their sole stockholder, their president, their sales manager, and three of their salesmen) induced many consumers to sign three-year retail installment contracts to purchase the following items: (a) an ordinary kitchen broiler which cost the respondents $ 80; time price $ 658.08; (b) another ordinary kitchen broiler which cost the respondents $ 120; time price $ 910.08; (c) an ordinary vacuum cleaner which cost the respondents $ 140; time price $ 920.52; and (d) a color television set which, on the average, cost respondents $ 450; time price $ 1292.40, or, if installed, up to $ 1575.  These contracts are unconscionable and shall not be enforced (Uniform Commercial Code, &sect; 2-302).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Besides falsely representing themselves and their products, the respondents induced their purchasers to sign purported agreements to earn commissions by referring respondents to other customers, and respondents fraudulently represented that their purchasers would earn, by means of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  an endless chain of referrals which was mathematically and realistically impossible, much more in commissions than their agreed purchase price and thus would never have to pay for their own purchases.  This scheme constituted a lottery, a nuisance, and an illegal business (Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 1370, 1371; N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 9; Executive Law, &sect; 63, subd. 12).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. These contracts are unenforcible since made in violation of the Retail Instalment Sales Act (Personal Property Law, &sect; 401 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.).  In violation of section 402 (subd. 2) of said law, the respondents in each case made separate documents of the simultaneously executed retail installment purchase contract, the commission agreement, and the installation order which provided for a 20% penalty if the consumer cancelled prior to delivery; and then, in violation of section 403 (subd. 3, last unnumbered par.) of said law, the respondents assigned only the retail installment purchase contracts to finance companies and thereby aided the finance companies to claim that since they did not know of the commission agreements which provided for performance for a period greater than 10 days, they were not subject to the purchasers' defenses&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  arising out of the sellers' nonperformance.  Chapter 872 of the Laws of 1965 added to the aforesaid section 402 (subd. 2) a specific provision that any promises to the purchaser to compensate him for referrals must be contained in the retail installment contract; but this was merely declarative of the already existing law as construed by the courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Two of the respondents also illegally transacted business through an unlicensed Connecticut corporation (Business Corporation Law, &sect; 1301, subd. [a]; &sect; 1312), and through an identical trade name which was filed in Connecticut but for which no license was ever filed in New York, and through another domestic corporation which was not licensed as a sales finance company (Banking Law, &sect; 491, subd. 7; &sect; 492).  These contracts are unenforcible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Accordingly, respondents are permanently enjoined from &quot;the continuance of such business activity&quot; and such &quot;fraudulent or illegal acts&quot; and such &quot;unconscionable contractual provisions&quot; (Executive Law, &sect; 63, subd. 12) and from aiding any others, through respondents' agents or attorneys, in enforcing such contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Subdivision 12 of section 63 of the Executive Law is constitutional and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The respondents' attack on the Attorney-General's good faith in prosecuting them is made in bad faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Pursuant to CPLR 8303 (subd. [a], par. 6), the Attorney-General is awarded $ 2,000 costs against one respondent and $ 500 costs against each of two other respondents.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 3212, the racing association filed a motion for a summary judgment in an action to retain breakage collected during a pari-mutuel betting season. The racing association contended that 1965 N.Y. Laws 567 was unconstitutional in that it enabled the Fund to derive income from pari-mutuel betting in violation of N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The Fund filed a cross-motion for a summary judgment asserting a right to collect its statutory 25 percent of the breakage accrued at the racing association's track. On consideration, the court denied the racing association's motion for a summary judgment and granted the Fund's motion for a summary judgment. The court held that the Fund's collection of its statutory percent of the breakage on pari-mutuel betting was constitutional because the Fund's activities were sufficiently allied with the original intent of N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 as to further its purposes. By providing for the Fund and its activities, the State was protecting its source of revenue for the support of government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town commenced condemnation proceedings against a tract of land, which it declared substandard and blighted. The town contemplated redevelopment of the area by the corporation as part of its urban renewal plan.

The court dismissed the petition, holding that: 1) taking of the substandard property for redevelopment by the corporation was a recognized &quot;public use;&quot; 2) the town observed proper procedures in selecting the corporation; 3) the contract with the corporation complied with the state constitution and state law; 4) the town was not prohibited from exercising its eminent domain powers because the corporation would profit from the venture; 5) it was impossible to set a minimum price for conveyance of the land to the corporation prior to completion of the condemnation proceedings; 6) the town adhered to the requisite open bidding requirements; and 7) the contract provided for payment of condemnation awards without pledging the faith and credit of the town or violating the state constitution or statutory law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer sought review of a determination of respondent State Tax Commission that there was a deficiency due from him for personal income taxes for 1962, based on the holding that the taxpayer's undistributable shareholder's earnings was includable in his New York state adjusted gross income and taxable under N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 612.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the taxpayer filed his state income tax return, he omitted his proportionate share of the undistributed income of a corporation, which he had included on his federal income tax return. The taxpayer had previously made an election under subchapter S of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1371. N.Y. Tax Law 612(a) provided that the New York adjusted gross income of a resident individual meant his federal adjusted gross income as defined in the laws of the United States for the taxable year. The taxpayer claimed unconstitutionality, pointing to N.Y. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 3, which provided in part, that undistributed profits would not be taxed. The court found that the argument overlooked N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 22, which went into effect on January 1, 1960, which required imposing taxes on income as defined by the laws of the United States. Because the year in question came after 1960, N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 612a applied, and the undistributed income of the taxpayer's corporation was taxable by the state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York State Constitution (art. XVI, &sect; 3, last sentence) provides, since 1939, that &quot;Undistributed profits shall not be taxed&quot;; but since January 1, 1960 said Constitution (art. III, &sect; 22) also provides that &quot;Notwithstanding * * * any other provision of this constitution, the legislature, in any law imposing a tax or taxes on, in respect to or measured by income, may define the income on, in respect to or by which such tax or taxes are imposed or measured, by reference to any provision of the laws of the United States as the same may be or become effective at any time or from time to time&quot;.  Accordingly, the Tax Law ( &sect; 612, subd. [a]), effective as to income taxable years ending on and after December 31, 1960, validly provides that &quot;The New York adjusted gross income&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of a resident individual means his federal adjusted gross income as defined in the laws of the United States for the taxable year&quot;.  Petitioner owned stock in a so-called &quot;subchapter S small business corporation&quot; which elected (under U. S.

Petitioner's share of such undistributed profits was $ 8,279.97.  He included this amount in his taxable income in his Federal income tax return, and he must likewise include this amount in his taxable income in his New York State income tax return. Our personal income Tax Law ( &sect; 612, subd. [a]) is not rendered unconstitutional by the fact that the Federal corporation tax statute grants this deduction to the corporation while our corporation tax statute apparently does not; in any event, petitioner is not the corporation and cannot complain of this apparent unfairness. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2553(2) provided for the selection of the members of the New York City Board of Education from nominations submitted to the mayor by a selection board. The parent argued that because the New York Education Law provided that other school districts could elect boards of education, the state had denied him the right to equal protection of the laws in violation of the federal and state constitutions. He further argued that such law had disenfranchised him and deprived him of rights and privileges received by other citizens in violation of N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The court held there was no violation of N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 1 because the parent had shown no constitutional or statutory authority indicating that boards of education were to be elected. It found the legislature, under the plenary power granted by N.Y. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1, had the right to provide for the selection of the New York City Board of Education in the manner set forth in N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2553(2). It also found no equal protection violation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Since the union operated under a closed shop arrangement with the employers, petitioners were required to pay a percentage of their gross earnings as an assessment for the privilege of pursuing this employment. Also, petitioners were beneficiaries of the union pension fund. The court held that petitioners were entitled to the relief they requested. While the general rule was that a union was free in the absence of special legislation to the contrary, to choose its members and to reject applications without judicial interference, many jurisdictions had refused to extend this rule to situations where a labor union held a monopoly in the supply of labor in the locality, or attempted to maintain both a closed shop and an arbitrarily closed union. Here, the union had engaged in arbitrary admission and monopolistic practices. Also, its arbitrary refusal to admit petitioners into membership threatened to effectuate a divestment of their pension fund benefits. This was tantamount to an unconstitutional usurpation of property. Finally, the practice of giving preference to applicants with filial ties to union members was illegal in light of constitutional and legislative guarantees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent union is the sole collective bargaining agent for stagehand and stage maintenance workers employed in the counties of New York and Bronx.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3212, plaintiff citizens sought a declaratory judgment attacking the apportionment of defendant county board of supervisors as being violative of the Equal Protection Clause and comparable sections of the state constitution. Among other items of relief, the citizens additionally sought a declaration that N.Y. County Law &sect; 150 and N.Y. Town Law &sect;&sect; 29(14), 41(4) were unconstitutional as they applied to the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens contended that because of the gross disparity in population among the towns and wards in the county, there resulted an arbitrary impairment of the votes of plaintiffs with respect to the apportionment of the board and that such an impairment deprived them of equal protection of laws. The court noted that the guarantee of &quot;one person, one vote&quot; had equal application to elective legislative bodies below the state legislature. Thus, the board had been required to insure that the vote of each citizen was approximately equal in weight to that of every other citizen. Although the court declined to prepare an apportionment of the board which would comply with the federal and state constitutions, as that relief was primarily a matter for the legislature, the court did grant the declaratory relief sought by the citizens. The court, however, believed that it was in the interest of orderly government to permit the board additional time to comply with the constitutional requirements. The court took into account the fact that the board had a committee in being which was attempting to prepare a permanent plan of reapportionment which would comply with federal mandates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the citizens' petition for declaratory relief, declined to prepare its own order of reapportionment, and granted the board additional time in which to prepare its own reapportionment plan, with no costs allowed to any party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff public utility brought an action against defendant property owners in the Supreme Court of New York for Erie County (New York) pursuant to N.Y. Conserv. Law. art 3-A, &sect; 86 to acquire gas storage rights in the property owners' land. The property owners challenged the public utility's right to condemn their property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners presented several arguments to challenge the public utility's action to condemn the property belonging to the property owners for purposes of acquiring gas storage rights. The court rejected all of the property owners' arguments and granted the public utility's petition to condemn the property and set in motion the procedure to ascertain the compensation to be paid to the property owners. The court also pointed out that the statute under which the public utility sought condemnation of the property owners' land was not deny the property owners' due process right to equal protection of the law. The court noted that the property owners were not within any class covered by the statute and, thus, had no standing to object. Even if the property owners had standing to object, the fact that the statute operated in favor of an existing use did not make it unconstitutional. Further the language of the statute concerning &quot;commercially reasonable&quot; and &quot;otherwise lawfully operating an underground reservoir&quot; were not so indefinite as to render the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the public utility was entitled to take and hold the gas storage rights in the property owners' land upon payment of just compensation therefor.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a special proceeding by a public utility engaged in the storage and sale of gas, to acquire&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  gas storage rights in land owned by defendants, the court determines on the papers as a question of fact that the subject property is located within the Quaker Pool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The subject property is sufficiently described by metes and bounds to identify it and the petition seeks storage rights in the Medina formation conceded to exist under the property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Section 86 of the Conservation Law does not require that the petition allege the presence or nonpresence of commercially recoverable native oil and gas.  It only requires that if such oil or gas is present, compensation be paid for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The petition is not insufficient for failure to designate as property to be acquired all the geological formations below the Medina formation. Defendants may offer proof to show that their use and enjoyment of the geological formation below the Medina will be damaged by plaintiff's acquisition of storage rights in the Medina formation and if damaged they are entitled to compensation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Section 86 of the Conservation Law authorizes a corporation empowered to store and distribute gas which is &quot;otherwise lawfully operating&quot; an underground storage reservoir, to acquire such rights by condemnation. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The contention that plaintiff's operation of the Quaker Pool is unlawful because it does not have leases authorizing it to store under the entire surface acreage within the Quaker Pool is rejected.  It would render the statute meaningless since the only gas companies that would be &quot;lawfully operating&quot; a pool would be those already having leases on 100% of the storage area -- those having no need for condemnation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. While private property cannot be taken for public use unless it is necessary for such public use, the necessity need only be a reasonable one.  Plaintiff already has storage rights in most of the acreage where the Quaker Pool is located.  The public necessity to acquire the remainder has been adequately shown by plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. An attack on the constitutionality of article 3-A of the Conservation Law under which plaintiff seeks to condemn the property cannot be made by defendants who are not in either of the classes covered by the statute and their rights have not been invaded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Assuming that defendants could object, the fact that the statute operates in favor of an existing use does not make it unconstitutional.  Classifications between existing and new enterprises&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are permissible so long as the classifications are not arbitrary or unreasonable.  The classification here is not unreasonable or arbitrary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Section 86 of the Conservation Law is not unconstitutional because it does not provide for compensation for native gas in place.  Native gas not commercially recoverable has no value to defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. A question of constitutionality is not presented by the claim that defendants will be deprived of the value of or access to geological formations below the Medina formation. If defendants lose the use and enjoyment of other strata, they are entitled to compensation.  A question of damages is presented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. The phrases in the statute (&sect; 86) &quot;commercially recoverable&quot; and &quot;otherwise lawfully operating an underground storage reservoir&quot; are not unconstitutionally vague.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board appointed a reapportionment committee that considered the redistricting problem. By resolution, the Board adopted by the committee's Plan B that provided for permanent weighted voting.

For example, one town had approximately 10 percent less than the mean or unweighted average of the voting power based on its population, but more than one 100 percent more voting power than the residents of another town. Weighted voting could also diminish the power of the most powerful personality in the group in cases where he had a relatively small vote.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county officials moved for an order declaring that a local law regarding membership and voting strength of the county board of supervisors complied with a prior court order and was consistent with U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. Plaintiff citizens cross-moved for an order nullifying the law as unconstitutional and enjoining defendants from placing the law for referendum. Two towns intervened to object to the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The burden was on the citizens to show that the local law denied to them the right to an effective vote in the election of the county board and that the discrimination was invidious. Although the court noted the board's efforts to adhere to the standards provided by the court's prior order, the question to be decided was whether the local law complied with the constitutional requirements of substantial equality in voting power. In other words, at issue was whether the citizens had shown that the weight of their votes had been substantially diluted when compared with the votes of those living in other political subdivisions of the county. The court found that it appeared from the figures submitted that the local law resulted in the vote of each citizen not being as equal as might be practicable to the vote of any other. Population could not submerged as the controlling consideration of the apportionment of voting strengths. The court declined to issue permanent relief in the case, allowing the board to conduct further consideration of the matter, and granted interim relief disapproving the local law and its application through the referendum process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the court declined to prescribe a plan of permanent reapportionment, it remitted the matter to the board for further consideration, with the court retaining jurisdiction for all purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- apportionment of Board of Supervisors -- reapportionment plan submitted by Westchester County Board of Supervisors found to contain disparities which result in substantial dilution of voting strength of certain subdivisions when compared, on population basis, with that of others -- such dilution could be avoided by further application of method of fractional or weighted voting utilized elsewhere in plan -- court does not reach determination as to whether said method is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> per se but decides only that its limited use in plan under consideration is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- matter remitted to board for further consideration -- interim plan prescribed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A reapportionment plan submitted by the Westchester County Board of Supervisors provides, among other things, for an increase in the board membership from 45 to 54 members, an increase in the total voting strength of the board from 45 to 48 votes, nine additional representatives from specified towns with large populations, fractional votes for representatives of specified towns with small populations and specified cities, and a continuance of the representation of the other town and city supervisors. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It combines fractional voting in both single and multi-member districts with voting in single and multi-member districts in which each representative has a single unweighted vote.  This might be constitutionally permissible if, as a result, the voting power of each legislator was substantially equal in the ratio that the population represented by him bore to the total county population.  However, the plan fails to accomplish that result and the matter must be remitted to the board for further consideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The plan uses a numerical basis of 18,000 persons for each vote and assumes that the &quot;one person, one vote rule&quot; permits a single legislator with an unweighted vote to represent a unit of population which contains 18,000 persons plus or minus 2,700 persons, an approximate 15% variation from the norm of 18,000, and that all subdivisions having populations of less than 15,300 persons should be given fractional votes and all subdivisions having populations of more than 20,700 persons should be represented by more than one legislator, on the basis of one for each 18,000 persons and each remaining fraction greater than .15.  There should be no quarrel with the selection of the 18,000&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  figure as a norm or standard for population comparisons where a 48-vote board is the objective since, if the county were divided into 48 districts of equal population, each district would have a population of approximately 17,775 votes, according to a 1965 special census. However, the plan contains disparities which result in a substantial dilution of the voting strength of certain subdivisions when compared, on the basis of population, with that of others.  For example, the Town of Greenburgh, with a population of 82,882, was assigned only four legislators and the Town of Yorktown, with a population of 22,044, was assigned one legislator, while other subdivisions having populations of less than 16,000 were each assigned one legislator.  Such dilution could be avoided by a further application of the method of fractional or weighted voting utilized elsewhere in the plan.  For example, the legislator from the Town of Yorktown could be assigned a 1.25 vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Since no party to the action has put it in issue, the court reaches no determination as to whether fractional or weighted voting is, per se, unconstitutional but decides only that its limited use in the plan here under consideration&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is unconstitutional under the circumstances and with the results here disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The use by the board of the population figures of a 1965 special census, rather than those of the 1960 decennial census, was not erroneous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The court prescribes an interim plan to be followed pending submission by the board of a permanent reapportionment plan.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the state employee was negligent in driving backwards without a clear field of vision. There was no evidence that the wife was negligent. Having decided that the husband was entitled to recover damages from the state, the court had to consider the amount of the award. The amount of damages were to be such sum as was deemed to be a fair and just compensation for the pecuniary injuries resulting from the wife's death. The amount of damages depended upon the value of the reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefits from the continuance in life by the decedent to the husband. The court held that the services rendered by a domestic and homemaker fell far short of the true loss of a wife and mother. It also took into consideration her potential earnings. The fact the vehicle had not yet been repaired did not preclude recovery for the cost of repair or reasonable rental while the car was out of service. The court also considered the present value of the dollar.</SPAN></P>

The property owner objected because the person who sought to purchase the building wanted to tear it down. The court denied the property owner's application for review of that decision. The court stated that there was no merit in the property owner's contention that the determination was unsupported by substantial evidence. A hearing was held and the issues thoroughly aired. The architectural, historical, and aesthetic value of the improvement was fully established, and the court could not substitute its judgment for that of the commission. The court held that the property owner's contention that the designation had impaired rights vested in the existing contract of sale was not supported in the record. There was no showing that its vendee has refused, or would refuse, to take under the contract or that it had suffered or was about to suffer any loss under the contract because of the designation. The court held that the zoning law as it applied to the property owner was not confiscatory because the property owner was free to do as it pleased with the interior of the building.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- Landmarks Preservation Commission of New York City -- Local Laws of 1965 (No. 46) of City of New York (adding ch. 8-A to New York City Charter) validly created Landmarks Preservation Commission -- after Manhattan Club contracted to sell its building to purchaser who planned to demolish it and erect 33-story office building, commission held hearing and validly designated building as landmark of historical or aesthetic interest -- effect of such designation is that owner may alter interior but not exterior, but, if owner cannot obtain reasonable return, commission must permit demolition or building must be acquired by purchase or eminent domain -- such local law is not confiscatory and is valid exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The General City Law ( &sect; 20, subd. 25-a) empowers cities to provide, subject to the Constitution and the general laws of the State, for the protection and perpetuation of buildings and places of historical or aesthetic interest.  By Local Law No. 46 of 1965, the City of New York added chapter 8-A to the New York City Charter.  This article established a Landmarks&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Preservation Commission.  In the city is a building which is a distinguished example of French Second Empire style of architecture and which was erected in 1859 for a lady who became the mother of the late Winston Churchill.  It has been owned and occupied since 1900 by the Manhattan Club. In recent years the club has been losing members and money; and so the club contracted to sell the property for $ 600,000 to a purchaser who plans to raze this historic building and erect a 33-story office building.  Thereupon the Landmarks Preservation Commission notified the seller and the buyer of a hearing, at which both appeared and opposed the commission's proposal; and then, upon substantial evidence, the commission validly designated the building as a landmark. Under the local law, the effect of such designation is that the exterior of the building cannot be altered or demolished without the commission's approval but the owner may do as it pleases with the interior, and, if the owner cannot obtain a reasonable return on its investment and the commission cannot devise a satisfactory plan for the preservation of the building, either the commission must permit demolition or the building is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to be acquired by purchase or eminent domain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The local law is a valid exercise of the police power. It is not confiscatory, since it does not preclude all uses for which the property is reasonably adapted. Contracts are subject to the State's police power; moreover, this seller has not shown that its contract vendee has refused to take or that it will suffer any loss.  </SPAN></P>

N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 501(1)(b). Defendant possessed a junior license and operated a motor vehicle within the restricted county. When defendant was prosecuted for the offense, he pled guilty. Since it was defendant's second offense, the plea constituted a misdemeanor crime, rather than an offense. The court held that the legislature was entitled to enact a statute that treated minors differently if there was a rational reason to do so. The court found that although there was a rational reason for restricting minor to operating a motor vehicle under a junior license, the further restriction of not allowing such an operation within one county in the state was not reasonable because the county had no special circumstances to warrant such a restriction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One town admitted the inequality of the voting in relationship to the population each supervisor represented. The court found that the disparity of population between that town and any other town or city district was unjustifiable and unreasonable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants charged with disturbing the peace in violation of Incorporated Village of Rockville Centre, N.Y., Ordinance 1.3(b) sought dismissal of the charges against them arising out of their failure to leave a village office when requested to do so by its director and two police officers. They claimed that the court had no jurisdiction of the subject matter or of their persons and that their actions were constitutionally protected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants and 18 others went to the village's urban renewal office late on a Friday afternoon, demanded to speak to its director, handed him more than 20 complaints, and demanded that he answer immediately. The director accepted the documents, stated he could not analyze them then and that he would answer on Monday, and asked them to leave because it was closing time. The director and a police officer instructed the group to leave, and all except defendants complied; officers carried them out of the office and arrested them upon the director's instruction. The court found that N.Y. Village Law &sect; 180 gave the court jurisdiction, that N.Y. Village Law &sect; 338 did not require trial within five days of arrest, and that even an illegal arrest did not affect jurisdiction over the person. The court found that although a State could not criminalize peaceful expression of unpopular views, people wishing to exercise free speech could not engage in disorderly conduct, that there was no discrimination practiced against defendants, and that the director and the officers behaved properly in the situation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion to dismiss the complaint and found both defendants guilty as charged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- disorderly conduct -- village ordinance -- two defendants who refused to leave village office after closing hours unless their lengthy written petition was answered were found guilty of violating village ordinance against disorderly or disturbing conduct -- Police Justice Court of village did not lose jurisdiction by consensual adjournment for over five days (cf. Village Law, &sect; 338).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The two defendants in this case were the only ones of a group of about 20 individuals who, after presenting a written petition or series of complaints, some 20 to 25 pages long, to the director of the urban renewal department of an incorporated village at office closing time on a Friday at 4:30 p.m., refused to accept his verbal assurance that he would study the petition and answer it on Monday, and insisted on staying in the office until he did answer.  Shortly after 5:00 p.m., the director, with the assistance of village police, arrested the two defendants, and he executed informations charging the defendants&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with violating an ordinance of the village which provides that: &quot;No person shall indulge in disorderly, or noisy or disturbing conduct within the Village. Any person who commits any of the following acts will be considered in violation of this provision * * * (b) acts in such manner as to annoy, disturb, interfere with, obstruct or be offensive to others&quot;.  The Police Justice Court of the village (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 74; Village Law, &sect; 180) tried the defendants and now finds them guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The provision of section 338 of the Village Law against adjourning a summary disorderly conduct hearing for more than five days seems inapplicable; in any event, the adjournment for more than five days in this case was requested by defendants' counsel at the arraignment and was consented to by the prosecution.  The court did not lose jurisdiction by such consensual adjournment. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The liquor wholesalers purchased certain brand label liquor outside the state and resold the liquor, still packaged. Pursuant to N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 99-a(3), respondents assessed an excise tax on the brand label liquor. The liquor wholesalers requested a refund of the taxes paid from respondents and, when the request was denied, brought an action against respondents for the refund. The court found that once the liquor wholesalers resold the brand liquor, regardless of whether the liquor was still in its original packaging, the brand liquor was no longer considered an imported product. The tax was thus on the privilege of selling a particular brand of liquor in the state. Thus, the court ruled that because the taxation was proper, the liquor wholesalers were not entitled to a refund.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the Original Packages Act (U. S. Code, tit. 27, &sect; 121), the import process as far as liquor in original packages is concerned, ceases upon the arrival in a State, and the product becomes subject to State regulation whether or not in the original package of importation. Accordingly, a fee for a liquor brand label use permit as authorized by section 99-a of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law is not in violation of clause 2 of section 10 of article I of the United State Constitution forbidding a State from laying a duty on imports. Moreover, section 99-a clearly indicates that the brand label use fee is not a tax on imports but rather a charge for the privilege of selling a particular brand of liquor in this State.  Measurement of the privilege fee by the volume of brand label liquors sold is a valid&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  exercise of regulatory power by the State, for the fee is not imposed on liquor as such but for the privilege of using a brand name. The fee does not contravene section 432 of the Tax Law which, with respect to taxes on liquor sold or used within the State, provides that no such tax shall apply to foreign or interstate commerce. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, boards of education, commenced a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 seeking to set aside the determination of respondent, the State Commissioner of Education, refusing to make an enumeration of the inhabitants of their school districts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The boards claimed that they were entitled to an enumeration as a matter of right and that an enumeration of less than a minimum population in each district was the only limitation on their powers to appoint district superintendents pursuant to N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 1711(1) and (3). The Commissioner refused to make an enumeration. The court dismissed the boards' petitions, holding that the Commissioner was given discretionary power under &sect; 1711(3) to veto the power of a district board to appoint a superintendent. The court found that the Commissioner's refusal to direct an enumeration was not an unreasonable exercise of his discretion because it had a rational basis to support it. The court determined that the appointment of two local superintendents over districts which did not constitute a complete school system would have resulted in no educational advantage. The court noted that the appointment would have eliminated the jurisdiction of the previously appointed superintendent over such local districts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Under section 1711 of the Education Law, a board of education of any union free school district may appoint a superintendent of schools if the population of the district is 4,500 or more, &quot;which fact shall be determined by the commissioner of education&quot;.  Prior to 1947 this section provided that, upon request by the district board for an enumeration of the inhabitants of the district, the Commissioner of Education &quot;shall&quot; cause such an enumeration to be made.  In 1947 the section was amended to substitute the permissive word &quot;may&quot; for the mandatory word &quot;shall&quot;.  The intent and effect of that amendment was to give the Commissioner discretionary power with respect to the making of an enumeration. Accordingly, a board of education&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is not entitled to one as a matter of right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. As the basis for his refusal to make requested enumerations in certain districts, the Commissioner cites certain standards for enumerations, to be applied in determining whether a district may employ a superintendent of schools, including &quot;Evidence of enrollment in grades K-12 exceeding 2000 pupils&quot; and &quot;Evidence that instruction is provided for all grades K-12&quot;.  Neither of the district boards whose requests for enumerations were refused has control over a complete school system comprising kindergarten through twelfth grade. No educational advantage would result from appointing two local superintendents, responsible only to the local boards, over such districts.  Accordingly, it may not be said that the Commissioner's refusal to make the requested enumerations was without a rational basis. </SPAN></P>

The court found that the investigation by the Commission was potentially flawed and the evidence provided by the parties was in conflict.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiff corporation's action for a declaratory judgment declaring that the receipts of coin-operated amusement devices were not subject to the tax imposed by N.Y. Tax Law art. 28, defendant state tax commission filed a motion for an order dismissing the complaint on the ground that it failed to state a cause of action and that the court did not have jurisdiction of the cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax commission contended that the exclusive remedies provisions in N.Y. Tax Law art. 28, &sect; 1140 were binding on the corporation and that it was thereby precluded from bringing a declaratory judgment action. The court found that the complaint contained allegations sufficient to invoke the court's powers to render a decision on the question of whether N.Y. Tax Law art. 28 was applicable to the corporation, and treated the motion as a motion for summary judgment pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3211(c). The court held that because the corporation authorized, empowered, or permitted the general public and, in particular, the patrons of the establishments where its amusement devices were located, to use its coin operated devices, provided the user inserted the proper amount of coins in consideration for such use, the corporation's operations amounted to the granting of licenses to use tangible personal property for a consideration. The court concluded that the proceeds of the corporation's coin-operated amusement devices were, therefore, taxable as retail sales under N.Y. Tax Law art. 28, &sect; 1105(a).</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer challenged legislation authorizing the payments as violative of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 and U.S. Const. art. III, &sect; 17 and the Equal Protection Clause. A motion to dismiss by the mayor and the attorney general was granted. The court held that any resulting discrimination was not based upon race, color, creed, or religion, and that public employees were not deprived of their privileges and immunities as citizens by the penalties of the Condon-Wadlin Law being selectively applied to public employees. The court held that the distinction was reasonable, and that public employees were not denied equal protection of the laws by virtue of the legislature's choice to restrict a small group, where it could have applied the legislation to an entire class of workers, provided the distinction was not unreasonable or arbitrary.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Civil Service Law ( &sect; 108 [&quot;Condon-Wadlin Act&quot;]) prohibits strikes by public employees, including employees of any public authority, and provides that a striking employee abandons his employment but may be re-employed and, if re-employed, his compensation shall not exceed what it was before he struck and shall not be increased for three years.  Any taxpayer may bring suit to declare illegal and to restrain payment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of compensation in violation of any provision of the Civil Service Law and to recover from appointing and fiscal officials any sums thus illegally paid (Civil Service Law, &sect; 102, subds. 1, 2).  Chapter 6 of the Laws of 1966, enacted and effective February 16, 1966, declares and finds (&sect; 1) that the recent strike of the employees of the New York City Transit Authority and of the Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority brought severe economic hardship and chaos to some 16,000,000 persons in the New York City metropolitan region, that the strike has been settled on the terms recommended by the mediation panel and the strikers have returned to their jobs, and that this act of the Legislature is necessary in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of said 16,000,000 people.  Said chapter 6 thereupon provides (&sect; 2) that, notwithstanding any provisions of law to the contrary, said two public authorities are hereby authorized and empowered to continue their employees in the same status as before the strike and to pay them the increased compensation pursuant to which they resumed their duties.

After observation at the reformatory, he was classified as a low-grade moron and transferred to an institution for male delinquents. Save for a brief release, he was confined until 1936. He was then transferred upon a &quot;Certificate of Lunacy&quot; to the state hospital, which was a prison with facilities for controlling psychotic convicts, where he remained until 1960. The court noted that his criminal sentence expired in 1936. The court found that the individual was held over at the hospital pursuant to N.Y. Correction Law &sect; 384, under an order that had been obtained without notice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughter sought summary judgment in connection with her objections, seeking to disallow the wife's claim to community property rights to decedent's property located in Louisiana. The wife's claim to such was based on La. Civ. Cod. art. 2400, which allowed non-resident married persons who acquired property within the state of Louisiana to be subject to the laws that regulate community property in Louisiana. The daughter argued that since the wife was omitted from the decedent's will, her interest in his estate was limited to the statutory right of election. The court determined that since the property that the wife was claiming was movable personal property, the laws of New York applied because the parties were married and lived in New York during their marriage. Therefore, the wife acquired no community property rights in personal property of the decedent.</SPAN></P>

II, &sect; 6 was unconstitutional in that it did not fall within the proper exercise of police power because its prohibitions were too broad. The court noted that &sect; 6 sought to restrict the flying of kites for the purpose of expressing political preferences. The court further discounted the State's argument that the flying of kites raised safety problems that were not involved in the distribution of political literature. The court found that the liberties of the press were not confined to newspapers, periodicals, pamphlets, and leaflets and that the wording of &sect; 6 was so vague that it was impracticable of enforcement or obedience.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a demurrer to a two-count indictment, which charged defendant, along with two others, with the crime of conspiracy, and one of the other defendants with the crime of perjury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State issued an indictment charging defendant and two others with conspiracy, and one of the other defendants with perjury. The State alleged that defendants conspired in their failure to disclose to the city council certain facts in order to bring about the purchase of certain real estate by the city at a price substantially higher than the owner's asking price. The State contended that defendants conspired to keep the city ignorant of the true asking price in order to profit from the city's purchase of the property at the greater price. Defendant filed a demurrer to the indictment. The court disallowed the demurrer, holding that the conspiracy count did not charge more than one crime where it accused him of engaging in a conspiracy in violation of several provisions of the penal law. The gist of the crime was not the act of doing the things that violated the several sections of the penal code; rather, the crime was the agreement to do them, which constituted a single act. Further, the indictment stated a crime against him, even though the duties of his office as Director of Real Estate were not specified, because it stated his role as a member of the alleged conspiracy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A count of an indictment charges moving defendant, a city official, and two others with conspiracy in that they planned to bring about the purchase of certain real estate by a city at an exaggerated price and to divide the profits among them.  More than one crime is not charged because the acts set forth in several subdivisions of section 580 of the Penal Law are stated to have been done.  The gist of the crime is not the doing of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the things set forth in the subdivisions of section 580 but in the agreement to do any of them.  The commission of one or more of the items prohibited establishes but one crime of conspiracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A conspiracy to commit a crime is an independent crime, distinct from the collateral crime or crimes contemplated and stated to have been committed in the indictment. The indictment does not charge the implementary substantive crimes mentioned therein and it does not therefore charge more than one crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The indictment is not defective because it fails to allege, in detail, the duties defendant as a city official was required to do and which he willfully neglected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. An objection that the named overt acts are barred by the Statute of Limitations is overruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The State has power to impose conditions which must be accepted if one is to be a public officer. When defendant executed the waiver of immunity before testifying before the Grand Jury in order to retain his job, he was not deprived of any constitutional rights. There was no compulsion.  The provisions of the State Constitution requiring the execution of a waiver of immunity by a public officer as a condition to testifying&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or losing his public office does not violate the Fifth Amendment, providing that no person shall be compelled in a criminal case to be a witness against himself, or the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A count of perjury in the indictment against one of the codefendants should not be severed. Its presence in the indictment is not prejudicial to moving defendant.  </SPAN></P>

Petitioner alleged that such payments would have been illegal under N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 108. Respondents filed a cross-motion before their answer to dismiss the petition. The court denied both parties' motions, holding that petitioner's action properly named the City and its officials as parties to the action because there was an interrelation between the City and the Transit Authority under New York law. Moreover, petitioner, as a private citizen, had standing to bring a mandamus action because respondents' conduct allegedly violated New York's Civil Service laws, which constituted both misfeasance and malfeasance.

Respondents' motion for dismissal of the petition was denied and they were permitted to serve and file answers ( CPLR 7804, subd. [f]), including the defense by answers or otherwise, as they might be advised, that the effect of the amendment (L. 1963, ch. 702) was to repeal the penalty provisions of said section 108 of the Civil Service Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Condon-Wadlin Law (Civil Service Law, &sect; 108) has been held constitutional in other cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.

The section further provides that any employee who asserts that he did not participate in the strike may within 10 days demand that a proceeding be commenced to determine that he did not violate the statute.  The statute is made part of article 7 ( &sect;&sect; 95-108) of the Civil Service Law, which is concerned with enforcement, prohibitions, penalties, certification of payrolls, duties of public officers, and civil and criminal proceedings against public officers who pay any compensation in contravention of the Civil Service Law. Plainly, the respondents are forbidden for three years from authorizing or paying any increase of compensation to the strikers. </SPAN></P>

The Planning Board recommended that the entire tract be rezoned &quot;Planned Business District.&quot; A public hearing was held and the ordinance amending the existing zoning ordinance and rezoning the premises by placing it in a B-General Business District was passed. Plaintiffs then challenged the amendment as &quot;spot zoning.&quot;The court agreed with plaintiffs and held that it was not the presently intended use but the many permitted uses authorized by the amendment for the vacant land that had to be judged. There was nothing in the record giving assurance that the land would be used solely for a restaurant and motel. Unless all the permitted uses are in harmony with the character of the neighborhood and the general community program, the amendment was not a part of a comprehensive plan, because all of the uses could be legally enjoyed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A zoning ordinance amendment which is not based on a comprehensive plan for the welfare of the whole community (Town Law, &sect;&sect; 261, 263), but which, instead, singles out a portion of a prime residential area and rezones it, apparently for the sole benefit of the owner of this rezoned spot, for any of the numerous uses which are permitted in a business zone, is an unreasonable exercise of the police power and is void. This property owner wished to build, on the main highway frontage, a building for a well-known chain of restaurants and motels. Instead, the broad rezoning of this strip permitted him to use it for any of the uses permitted in a business zone, such as gasoline service stations or several dozen different businesses and incidental manufacturing processes, or even possibly for trailer parks.  The Planning Board and the Zoning Board of Appeals had recommended that definite conditions and restrictions be imposed by the town; but, instead, a setback agreement was made between the owner and his&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  grantee corporation, which contained some general verbiage about &quot;existing trees and natural beauty&quot; and nothing about restricting the use to a restaurant and motel, and which in any event was unrecorded and was to last only three years or until some new zoning ordinance of unspecified character might be adopted.  The changes which had occurred in this area since the adoption of the original zoning ordinance had not been of a character to downgrade the area.  The rezoning of this spot discriminated against the rest of the area and against the general welfare of the whole town.  The owner and his grantee and the Town Board are restrained from acting pursuant to this void amendment.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that the doctor was entitled to an order suppressing all evidence and evidentiary leads obtained or derived from the unreasonable search and seizure and intended to be used in support of counts 2 to 27 inclusive, that the exclusionary rule covered the fruits as well as the evidence obtained by an unlawful search, and that the state could proceed only on the basis of knowledge of the facts shown to have been gained from independent and untainted sources.

The bookseller filed an action to declare the statutes unconstitutional on the ground that obscenity was the sole test of constitutionality and that variable standards of obscenity could not be applied to adults and minors. The bookseller filed a motion for summary judgment. The Commissioner filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The court found that the bookseller's challenge to the constitutionality of the statutes was without merit. The court ruled that the State of New York had a legitimate interest in preventing the dissemination of material deemed harmful to children and that it was not unconstitutional to prohibit the dissemination of material that was not obscene in the hands of adults but that could be harmful to children because the bookseller's constitutional right to make a profit could not take precedence over the legitimate and exigent power of the state to protect the welfare of its youth.</SPAN></P>

Each subsequent amendment to the Constitution carried the same omnibus provision for the trial by jury to remain inviolate, but in each of these instances, the framers had in mind the trial by 12 individuals. Under all of the circumstances, the alleged constitutional attack was not warranted by law. Vagrancy cases had been tried for years in which both men and women had been involved in the Magistrates' Courts of the City of New York and in other courts without a jury, and it had long been recognized that this was not a violation of the Constitution, nor the violation of the constitutional rights of any defendant.</SPAN></P>

The landowners contended that under Village of Hempstead, N.Y., Village Law &sect; 179 (1956), the resolution approving the requested zoning change was effective when adopted by a vote of a three-fourths majority. The landowners claimed that, to the extent Village of Hempstead, N.Y., Building Zone Ordinance &sect; 2004 was inconsistent with the Village Law, it was invalid, and, since the resolution was adopted as provided in the Village Law, it was effective. The village contended that the passage of the zoning resolution required an unanimous vote by the board because over 20 percent of the owners of the area affected submitted written protests.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- apportionment of Board of Supervisors -- where 40% of population elects majority of members of Board of Supervisors, board is unconstitutionally organized -- existence of political remedies is not bar to judicial relief -- charters of six cities within county are not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Town Law, insofar as it provides that each town shall have one supervisor, is not invalid -- provisions of Westchester County Charter and Administrative Code are </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- other judicial relief denied for present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Where a majority of the Board of Supervisors of Westchester County can be elected by the voters in towns and cities which have less than 40% of the population of the county, and legislation can be enacted or defeated by the supervisors so elected, the present apportionment or districting of the Board of Supervisors is unconstitutional as violating the principle of one person, one vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. That plaintiffs may invoke political remedies which will give them adequate relief is not a bar to judicial relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The City Charters of the Cities of Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, Peekskill, Rye, White Plains and Yonkers to the extent that they require the election&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the number of supervisors specified therein, without regard to population, are not unconstitutional.  The supervisors elected in the cities, although automatically becoming members of the County Board of Supervisors are not elected as such but as city officers, exercising their voting power as supervisors under other general and other special or local laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Town Law is not invalid insofar as it provides that each town in Westchester County shall have a supervisor. Inequality in representation, as between cities and towns, results from the operation of other statutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Provisions of the Westchester County Charter and of its Administrative Code, insofar as they require or authorize the continuance of the Westchester County Board of Supervisors as presently constituted and as its voting power is presently apportioned are unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Plaintiffs' demands for other relief are denied.  Legislative apportionment is primarily a matter for legislative consideration and judicial relief becomes appropriate only when a legislative body fails to reapportion according to constitutional requisites in due time after having had an adequate opportunity to do so.  However, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  court retains jurisdiction of the action for all purposes with the right to any party to seek further relief.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator sought, by way of a writ of habeas corpus, her release from respondent state hospital upon the following grounds: (a) the unconstitutionality, defectiveness and invalidity of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator's petition stated that her detention was pursuant to an order of the court made on the 22d day of November, 1965, which found relator to be a person mentally ill, and in need of retention for care and treatment, and which directed her transfer to the state hospital. Relator alleged and the hospital did not deny that relator was first committed pursuant to an order made by a Justice of the Peace on the 23d day of October, 1965. That order was made following an appearance by relator before that Magistrate pursuant to a warrant issued by him and recited that it was made pursuant to the provisions of &sect; 78-4. The court held that the Magistrate's order of October 23, 1965, became functus officio 30 days after that date and was not the cause of relator's detention. The latter order was made following a hearing held at the request of relator for an order directing the retention of relator for treatment as a mentally ill person. The court held that the Supreme Court's jurisdiction to conduct a judicial inquiry into the findings and recommendations was completely independent from the proceedings in the Justice's Court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An allegedly mentally ill person was first committed to a hospital in a city, for 30 days' observation, by an order of a Justice of the Peace (Mental Hygiene Law, &sect; 78, subds. 1, 4), and then, on the 30th day, was committed to a State hospital for a period not to exceed six months, by an order of a Justice of the Supreme Court, made after a hearing (Mental Hygiene Law, &sect; 72, subd. 3; &sect;&sect; 73, 74; &sect; 78, subd. 2).  By writ of habeas corpus (Mental Hygiene Law, &sect; 426), she attacks the constitutionality of the statute under which the Justice of the Peace acted.  But that issue is moot.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A narcotic drug was found in a car in which both defendants were present. Under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1751, subd. 4, a presumption arose that every person present in the car had knowing possession and control of the narcotics. Defendants moved to inspect the Grand Jury records or to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the presumption was unconstitutional, the presumption did not apply because the quantity of narcotics found was not great enough to trigger it, and the narcotics were obtained as a result of an illegal search and seizure. The court denied the motion. The court held that the presumption was constitutional because it was neither conclusive nor arbitrary. It was rebuttable, and there was a rational and pragmatic connection between the facts proved and the presumption. Although the amount of narcotics found in the car was not great enough to trigger the presumption, brown paper bags containing drugs that defendants threw out of the car when officers approached also counted in the total amount. The question regarding the search and seizure should have been raised by a motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- narcotics -- subdivision 4 of section 1751 of Penal Law provides that presence in automobile of stated amount of narcotic is presumptive evidence of possession in violation of law by every person in automobile; such presumption is constitutional -- throwing away under observation of some or all of drug does not avoid statutory presumption -- legality of search and seizure may not be challenged by motion to inspect Grand Jury minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 4 of section 1751 of the Penal Law provides that the presence in an automobile, other than a public omnibus, of any narcotic drug in a stated amount or more shall be presumptive evidence of its possession and control knowingly in violation of law by each and every person found in such automobile at the time such narcotic drug is found.  Such presumption is constitutional and does not destroy the presumption of innocence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff concerned citizens brought an action for a declaratory judgment seeking a declaration that the enactment by defendant, Council of the City of Rochester (city), of an ordinance establishing a Police Advisory Board (board) was invalid. Rochester, N.Y. Municipal Code ch. 10, vol. II, &sect;&sect; 10-10.1 through 10-10.25. The city brought a motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sections 10-10.1 through 10-10.25 created the board, required the chief of police to conduct an initial investigation when a complaint was received regarding the conduct of a police officer, and authorized the board to evaluate the chief's report, and if necessary, conduct its own investigation. Only when the board and the chief were unable to arrive at a common conclusion was the board required to report its findings to the commissioner of police. The court struck certain provisions from the municipal code, concluding that in some instances the board had been given the authority to do that which could have only been done by the commissioner. The court explained that &sect; 387 provided that the commissioner was to cause a preliminary investigation to have been made when a complaint regarding the conduct of an officer was made and that the commissioner was to punish any officer found guilty of the charges against him. The court concluded that the city manager, whom was given the authority to appoint the board, had no authority pursuant to &sect; 387 to participate in a disciplinary proceeding against a police officer, either directly or by means of an agency or board appointed by him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that portions of the ordinance were invalid and ordered those provisions stricken from the ordinance. The court ordered any matter in a personnel file of a police officer emanating from a procedure not in compliance with the municipal code expunged from that officer's record.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- police -- ordinance creating citizens' &quot;Police Advisory Board&quot; is adjudged invalid insofar as it empowers board to investigate and hear complaints and publish reports that any policeman has used excessive force -- board's report would constitute reprimand without finding of guilt and, in practice, would affect policeman's service record rating and his fitness for promotion (N. Y. Const., art. V, &sect; 6).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A civic organization, and three policemen of the City of Rochester who are under investigation by a citizens' &quot;Police Advisory Board&quot; on charges of having used excessive or unnecessary force, are granted summary judgment declaring that the major portions of the ordinance creating the board are invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The ordinance amends the city's Municipal Code as follows: The City Manager shall appoint a board of nine persons, none of whom shall be an active law-enforcement officer, to investigate and hear complaints that any policeman has used excessive or unnecessary physical force, and to recommend appropriate action; however, the board is &quot;without any judicial or disciplinary powers&quot;.  Under the ordinance, the Chief of Police must report to the board&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his own findings, recommendations and report of action taken, together with all evidence on which they are based.  Then the board may investigate. The board must hold a closed hearing if the aggrieved person so requests in writing.  If the board agrees with the Police Chief's report, it shall so report to the complainant, the City Manager, the Commissioner of Public Safety and the Police Chief.  If the report of the board and the report of the Police Chief disagree, the Police Chief may conduct further investigations and the board and the Police Chief may endeavor to arrive at a &quot;common conclusion&quot;.  If this fails, the board shall report the disagreement and its own findings and recommendations to the City Manager and the Commissioner of Public Safety, and if satisfactory action is not taken within two weeks the board may make its recommendations public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. This amendment of the city's Municipal Code is inconsistent with an existing section of the city's Municipal Code which provides that the Commissioner of Public Safety shall investigate any charges against any policeman and that the Commissioner or his delegate shall hold hearings on such charges and that if the policeman is found&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  guilty, the Commissioner may punish him by reprimand or fine or demotion or dismissal from the service.  The board's public findings would, in effect, constitute a reprimand without a finding of guilt. Yet, in the case of at least one plaintiff policeman, the board's findings have been made a part of the official personnel file.  Apparently the board's report might affect a policeman's service record ratings and his merit and fitness for promotion (N. Y. Const., art. V, &sect; 6).  The court adjudges that the major sections of the ordinance are invalid, and that any matter in the personnel files of a policeman which has come from the board and which has not been processed in accordance with the pre-existing disciplinary procedures should be expunged. </SPAN></P>

Defendant was informed that he had to leave his place of residence and go to New York to testify in the bankruptcy proceedings. Defendant did so and was arrested on the arrest warrants.

Code &sect; 755(3)-2.1 after a police officer observed his table on public property that contained literature opposing American foreign policy in Vietnam.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant set up a table on a sidewalk close to the curb in Greenwich Village. The table contained literature opposing American foreign policy in Vietnam and condemned the armed intervention there. An American flag was attached to the table. A police officer observed a crowd of people near defendant's table and requested defendant to move the table. Defendant refused and asserted his constitutional right to erect a table for the purpose of informing passers-by of his opposing views on American foreign policy by speaking and distributing literature. Defendant argued that double jeopardy applied and that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated his freedom of expression. The court held that double jeopardy did not apply because defendant's counsel consented to the mistrial and the new trial. The court determined that defendant was not guilty of littering. The court held that although the sidewalk was partly obstructed, there was no evidence that anyone was seriously inconvenienced. The pedestrians were not so inconvenienced as to justify a police officer in stilling the voice of defendant's protest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. One night, on the sidewalk close to the curb, defendant set up a table, 4 feet by 4 feet, containing literature opposing American foreign policy in Viet Nam.  He also planned to speak to passers-by from this site.  Since pedestrians were not seriously inconvenienced by defendant's exercise of his constitutional right of free speech and peaceful protest, defendant is not guilty of violating section 692h-1.0 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, which prohibits the incumbering or obstructing of any street. Such a statute cannot constitutionally be applied to this situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner argued that the employer was required by N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 726 to file a financial report. The employer filed the report but made no answer to one question. The employer stated that its refusal for noncompliance was not based on belief that he stood in danger of criminal prosecution by giving a responsive answer in his report but on the belief that the question showed contempt for his dignity as a citizen presumed to be innocent. The court concluded that (1) there was no issue of privilege against self incrimination; and (2) the duty imposed upon those employers described in the statute, namely to completely fill out and file the requisite Form LP-1, could not be disregarded, no matter how distasteful an employer found such mandated obligation.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner alleged that the distinction between a person who was able to pay the fine and one who was unable to do so, offended the Eighth Amendment. The court concluded that (1) a claim of unequal treatment would be presented whenever an indigent was confined in default of payment of a fine, whether that confinement was for even one day, completely aside from the fact that a longer term could have been imposed as punishment; and (2) sentences whether they imposed fines or terms of imprisonment, fell upon those convicted with unequal impact depending upon many factors.</SPAN></P>

It is not claimed that the prescribed punishment is excessive or unusual and it was not unlawful since the court had authority to pronounce it.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed an ordinance limiting the weight of trucks operated within the city except for trucks making deliveries on Abbott Road. Abbott Road started in the city and dead-ended in the town. The company's plant was located on Abbott Road in the town. The only access to the plant was by taking one of the city's other streets to Abbott Road and driving through the city on Abbott Road. The effect of the ordinance would have been to halt all traffic to and from the plant. The company filed an action for a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was unconstitutional, an injunction against enforcement, and to require the town to create access to the plant. The town filed a cross-claim against the city. The court held that the ordinance was void and enjoined its enforcement. The court held that an implied easement of necessary ingress and egress to an abutting public street arose unless the abutting owner had access to another adequate street. The denial of such an easement constituted the taking of property without due process of law. The court held that the city could exclude heavy trucks from certain streets, but there had to be adequate, safe and suitable alternative routes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An old public road called Fisher Road begins, at one end, in the City of Lackawanna at the intersection of said road with another city street, and thence runs easterly 1,000 feet through a residential zone of the city to the dividing line between the city and the Town of West Seneca, and thence continues for 1,400 feet through a manufacturing zone of the town to the barrier of the New York&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  State Thruway.  Before the Thruway was built in 1957 through the town, Fisher Road continued further on and connected, at its other end, with an intersecting road in the town; but now Fisher Road ends at the Thruway barrier, like a cul-de-sac. Plaintiff's factory is in the town, on Fisher Road.  Plaintiff makes toasted bread crumbs for dog food.  Plaintiff uses trucks and tractor-trailers which weigh from 8 to 15 tons when loaded. Plaintiff could not remain in business economically if it were required to use smaller trucks. Yet the city has recently, in 1965, enacted an ordinance which prohibits trucks which weigh more than 5 tons gross from using Fisher Road, except when making deliveries -- meaning, of course, except when making deliveries on the part of Fisher Road which lies within the city.  The city has not formally established any truck routes (cf. Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 1640).  Fisher Road and its intersecting street in the city have been used for over 40 years as a truck route. The ordinance is aimed at plaintiff, and it unreasonably deprives plaintiff of property rights without compensation and without due process of law.  Moreover, many of the town's own service&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trucks weigh more than 5 tons when loaded, and, in order to use Fisher Road, must first enter Fisher Road at its beginning point of intersection within the city.

The portion of Fisher Road which lies within the town was formerly a county highway; but the court finds that, when the Thruway was built in 1957 and the Thruway barrier made a cul-de-sac of this portion of Fisher Road, the county abandoned this portion of Fisher Road and that thereupon this portion reverted to the town.  </SPAN></P>

Penal Law &sect;&sect; 484-h, 484-i and enjoining the enforcement thereof by defendants, the city police commissioner, the county district attorney, and an individual who allegedly threatened to initiate further criminal proceedings. The booksellers sought temporary injunctive relief, and motions to dismiss were filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged statutes prohibited the sale of sexually offensive literature to minors. The booksellers contended that it was unconstitutional to restrict the right to sell books on the basis of the age of the purchaser. The court dismissed the complaint against the individual, holding that a complaint against an individual could not be predicated upon an asserted violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV.As to the relief sought against the officials, the court observed that, to warrant the granting of a temporary injunction, the showing of a right to ultimate permanent relief had to be clear. A statute, however, was entitled to a presumption of regularity and validity, and laws for the protection of children's well-being were within the state's police power.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An action for a declaratory judgment is the proper remedy to test the validity of a statute.  However, in such an action, there is a presumption of validity in favor of the questioned statutes, in this case sections 484-h and 484-i of the Penal Law, making criminal the sale to persons under 17 and 18 years of age, respectively, of sexually offensive literature.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appropriated the property owner's hotel properties for highway purposes. The award included interest from the date of the filing of notice of appropriation and map to the date of the entry of judgment on the award. The property owner remained in possession of the premises and continued to operate the hotel enterprise for six months after he received notice of appropriation. After entry of judgment on the award, the state officials unilaterally withheld a sum as the fair rental value of the condemned property for the period that the property owner had possession after the notice of appropriation. The court observed that, although a condemnee was not allowed interest during periods when the condemnee had an equivalent use of the property, the burden of proof as to any amount sought to be offset was upon the state. The state officials, having failed to sustain that burden at trial, had no authority to withhold funds that were due and owing pursuant to a valid and binding judgment.</SPAN></P>

He remained in profitable possession and operation of the hotel properties, until November 9, 1964.  The State did not cause him to be summarily dispossessed; nor did the State make any agreement with him as to rent to be paid by him for use and occupation pending an award; nor did the State make any assertion in the Court of Claims as to the value of his use and occupation; nor did the State appeal from the judgment of the Court of Claims awarding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  him $ 72,763.83 (Highway Law, &sect; 30, subds. 6, 12, 13-c).  Said last-mentioned subdivision (Highway Law, &sect; 30, subd. 13-c) became effective on April 22, 1964, after title had vested on March 23, 1964.  The portion of said subdivision which permits the State to withhold moneys due on a judgment of award is not retroactive. Of course, even prior to said subdivision's enactment, the State could have asserted in the Court of Claims that the claimant owed the fair value of his use and occupation as an offset to any interest on the award; but the burden of so alleging and proving was on the State.  The State's failure so to allege or prove cannot give it the right to attack the judgment collaterally.  Accordingly, the owner is granted an order of the Supreme Court ( CPLR, art. 78) directing the State officials to pay him the balance of the sum awarded by the Court of Claims.  </SPAN></P>

Apparently the Building Department had determined that the so-called &quot;grocerette&quot; was not one of the &quot;accessory uses&quot; permitted by the New York City Zoning Resolution (&sect; 12-10).  Defendant did not appeal to the city's Board of Standards and Appeals (New York City Charter, &sect; 666, subd. 6).  He ignored the order at his peril.

On a farm, one isolated trailer may be permitted, since it is unlikely that its sewage will contaminate the water supply of the general area.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner owner sought review of the order from the Superintendent of Building and Rehabilitation (New York), which required the demolition of the owner's building. The proceedings were commenced by an order obtained by the owner, which directed respondent city to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be granted enjoining the city, until the determination of this action, from destroying the building.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner had a building that was sited for multiple violations of the city housing code. After the owner failed to correct the violations, the superintendent issued a final order to demolish the building. The petitioner did not demolish the building so the superintendent received bids for the demolition of the building. The owner obtained an order restraining the city from demolishing the building pending the hearing and determination of the appeal of the order. At the hearing, the court set aside and annulled the decision of the superintendent and remanded the case. The court concluded that: (1) the action by the superintendent was judicial or quasi-judicial because it involved the taking of or interference with the owner's property right; (2) a formal adversary hearing should have been held; (3) the housing code mandated that the superintendent provide notice to the owner, but such notice was never received; and (4) the owner was deprived of due process of law when the superintendent attempted to take his building without notice and an opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court annulled and remanded the order of the superintendent and ordered the superintendent to proceed in accordance with the housing code in an attempt to correct violations at the building or take other appropriate action against the owner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- dilapidated buildings -- court considers application as one under CPLR (art. 78) to review order of Superintendent of Building directing demolition of petitioner's building -- constitutionality of Housing Code cannot be determined in such proceeding -- order to demolish made without hearing on notice to petitioner as required by Housing Code constituted illegal exercise of authority and is annulled -- trial of petitioner held on three charges of violating Housing Code in Criminal Court did not warrant order or obviate requirement of hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An application is considered as one made pursuant to CPLR 7801 to review an order issued by the Superintendent of Building of respondent city directing the demolition of petitioner's building since the court has jurisdiction of the necessary parties and CPLR 103 (subd. [c]) guarantees that no &quot;civil judicial proceeding&quot; shall be dismissed solely because it is cast in the wrong form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A determination that the Housing Code of the City of Syracuse is unconstitutional cannot be made in a proceeding under CPLR (art. 78) because CPLR 7803 specifies what questions can be raised and the determination of constitutionality&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of an ordinance is not one of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Respondent determined that petitioner's building violated the Housing Code.  Since the resulting order involved the taking of or interefence with a property right of petitioner, an adversary type hearing should have preceded the action and only facts supported by substantial evidence introduced at that hearing should be relied on in sustaining the action since the Housing Code itself provides for a hearing on notice preceding any action which the Superintendent of Building might take.  Never was petitioner granted a hearing on any of the numerous violations of the Housing Code alleged to exist by the Superintendent.  Because he failed to comply with the requirements of the Housing Code, his order and determination to demolish the building violated the code and constituted an illegal exercise of authority.  His determination is annulled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Petitioner was found guilty after trial in the city's Criminal Court of three violations of the code.  The existence of these three violations did not warrant the determination to demolish nor does the trial obviate the requirement of the code that a hearing on notice, specifying the alleged defects, be held&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  before the Superintendent of Building.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled that defendant could not rely upon the decision of the United States Supreme Court which struck down a series of Connecticut statutes as unconstitutional as invading the privacy of the marital relationship. Defendant was not entitled to relief because he was, in effect, asking the court to enact new law rather than to interpret the laws on the books. Defendant was basing his contentions upon the social aspects of the law in question, rather than the legal aspects. The law relative to the sale, distribution, advertising, etc. of contraceptives, delineated in N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1142, had been held to be constitutional since 1917. When defendant was arrested and charged pursuant to &sect; 1142, the law was as it was set forth, and defendant could not change that fact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movants, a state assembly speaker and state senate president pro tempore, filed a motion for leave to intervene as petitioners in an action that concerned reapportionment of the state assembly and state senate. The speaker and president pro tempore also moved for an order for appointment of three referees for the purpose of the formulation of a comprehensive reapportionment plan of the assembly and senate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court had previously determined that a reapportionment plan for the assembly and senate approved by a three-judge federal district court violated provisions of the state constitution. Notwithstanding the affirmance of the court's prior determination by a state appellate court, a majority of the federal district court panel directed that special legislative elections be conducted under that plan even after a state appellate court had enjoined its use in the special elections. The court granted the motions for leave to intervene. The court deferred the motion for reference because it desired that the legislature was to have one last opportunity for enactment of a valid legislative reapportionment. The court held that it had to assume a supervisory role in the reapportionment process, ordered the imposition of deadlines upon the legislature, and was prepared for assurance that the next regular legislative election and a subsequent constitutional convention was to be had pursuant to a redistricting and reapportionment plan in conformity with the state constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court permitted the substitution of the speaker as a defendant and intervention of the president pro tempore as a plaintiff. The court established a deadline for respondents' submission of a reapportionment plan for the court's approval. If no plan were submitted, the court would formulate a plan for use in the next election, subject to the approval of a federal district court. The court deferred the motion for the appointment of referees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- apportionment of Legislature -- Speaker of State Assembly permitted to intervene as respondent in proceeding to review legislative reapportionment plan approved by Federal court -- President pro tem of Senate entitled to intervene as petitioner -- proceeding not exhausted by prior final judgment affirmed by Court of Appeals -- appointment of Referees to formulate plan not subject to denial on basis of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Glinski v.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Since the Speaker of the New York State Assembly was a necessary party in the original proceeding to review a legislative reapportionment, his right to intervene in this proceeding to review a legislative reapportionment approved by the Federal court is absolute, but as a party respondent, to be substituted for another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The President pro tem of the State Senate is entitled to intervene as a party petitioner either under CPLR 1012 (subd. [a], par. 2) or CPLR 1013.  The interests of all the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  citizens are inadequately represented by present petitioners who oppose a request for affirmative relief at this time when such a request is in the best interest of the citizenry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Even though this proceeding resulted in a final judgment (45 Misc 2d 616) affirmed by the Court of Appeals (15 N Y 2d 339), the proceeding is not exhausted. In order to give effect to that prior judgment, the court must fashion some immediate and continuing relief, and the instant applications are appropriate for that purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Relief by way of appointment of Referees to formulate a constitutional reapportionment plan need not be denied on the basis of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Glinski </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Lomenzo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (16 N Y 2d 27).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A reference under article 43 of the CPLR is inapposite.  CPLR 4001 empowers the court to appoint Referees in the ordinary course of events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Since the primary responsibility for apportionment rests with the Legislature, the Legislature is given another opportunity to enact a constitutionally valid reapportionment plan before the court will formulate its own plan of reapportionment. The court defers decision on the employment of a panel of Referees.  However, it assumes a supervisory role in reapportionment. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Accordingly, respondents are directed to submit a plan to reapportion the Senate and Assembly which complies with the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and with all applicable provisions of the New York State Constitution not in conflict with the United States Constitution on or before February 1, 1966.  Upon their failure to do so, the court shall undertake formulation of a reapportionment plan which shall, with Federal District Court approval, govern the November, 1966 election of members of the Legislature, and the court may at any time appoint Referees to assist in the formulation of a plan if it determines that respondents are not proceeding with diligence to complete a plan before February 1, 1966.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Syracuse City Court (New York), which convicted him of a violation of N. Y. Penal Law &sect; 722(2) and of a violation of City of Syracuse, N. Y. Rev. Gen. Ordinance &sect; 38-a, ch. 16, art. 11. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his demurrer to the information charging a violation of the city ordinance on the ground that the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant went to the police station, seeking response to his letter to the police chief. The chief was not in, and he was asked to make an appointment for a later time. Evidence was controverted as to whether defendant then stood at one side of the stairway or whether he walked back and forth on the stairs, blocking access. Defendant was charged with violating City of Syracuse Rev. Gen. Ordinance &sect; 38, ch. 16, art. 11, which prohibited loitering about a public building so as to prevent access by others. Defendant demurred to the charge, arguing that the ordinance was void for vagueness. The city court convicted him and he sought review. The court affirmed. The court found that an anti-loitering provision would be void if it did not distinguish between conduct that was innocent and conduct that was harmful. The court noted that the Syracuse ordinance prohibited loitering that was coupled with impeding access and the conduct of business. The court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutional. The court rejected defendant's argument that the ordinance prevented lawful assembly, finding that a lawful demonstration was underway outside the building when defendant was arrested.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for violating the city's anti-loitering statute over his contention that the ordinance was void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- loitering -- city ordinance prohibiting loitering in public building is constitutional where it prohibits specific stated conduct -- ordinance does not prohibit right to petition or to demonstrate publicly -- evidence established defendant's guilt of violating ordinance beyond reasonable doubt -- defendant's conduct on stairway and refusal to obey reasonable police order violated Penal Law ( &sect; 722, subd. 2) -- defendant's conviction did not violate his constitutional rights of assembly, free speech and petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A city ordinance providing that no person shall loiter in a public building or obstruct stairways so as to prevent free access by members of the public or interfere with or interrupt the conduct of business in offices of such building is not unconstitutional.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The ordinance does not prohibit the right to petition or to publicly demonstrate.

The standards under the present&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  city ordinance established definite guide lines for the police.  The presumption of validity of the ordinance has not been overcome nor has the presumption of its inherent constitutionality been overcome.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. It also showed that defendant's conduct upon the stairway of the public building and refusal to obey the reasonable police order was such as to violate subdivision 2 of section 722 of the Penal Law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Art. 7-A was enacted after this dispute arose between the tenants and the mortgagee, which had bought in the property in foreclosure. The tenants claimed that the failure of the central air conditioning system and other conditions in the building were health hazards, and desired to pay their rent into court and have it directed to fixing the conditions. In denying the mortgagee's motion to dismiss the petition, the court held that art. 7-A was a remedial statute, and retroactive application of remedial statutes was generally constitutional. The court held that art. 7-A merely enlarged an existing remedy in N.Y. Real Prop. Acts. Law &sect; 755. The court held that art. 7-A was a valid and not unreasonable exercise of the police power, and noted that so long as a law was reasonable, a court could not inquire into the wisdom of its enactment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chapter 909 of the Laws of 1965 (adding art. 7-A to Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law, and amending New York City Civil Court Act) declares the legislative intent to police judicially conditions which are dangerous to the life, health or safety of the occupants of multiple dwellings, regardless of the building's age or location, and authorizes a proceeding to be instituted by one third of the tenants in such a multiple&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  dwelling in the City of New York for a judgment permitting the tenants to deposit the rents in court and directing that a court-appointed administrator apply such rents towards remedying such conditions.  The statute is a valid and constitutional exercise of the police power, and the New York City Civil Court so determines ( CPLR 603).  The remedy provided by this statute is in addition to other remedies (cf. Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law, art. 7, &sect; 755; Multiple Dwelling Law, &sect; 309).  The court may entertain the petition even though no departmental violations have been filed against the building.  Furthermore, the statute applies to rents which were already past-due on the statute's effective date, July 17, 1965.  This remedial statute may be particularly appropriately applied to a high-class multiple dwelling such as this one, which is not rent-controlled, and where, therefore, the City Rent and Rehabilitation Administrator cannot reduce the rents to $ 1 and thus persuade the landlord to make the necessary repairs or replacements.  The question remains to be tried whether the conditions in this building are indeed dangerous to life, health or safety of occupants. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the sentence of 11 months and 29 days imposed on him by the Court of Special Sessions of the Village of Goshen (New York) pursuant to his conviction for assault in the third degree on the basis that the imposition of an extra day's confinement for each $ 1 of a $ 250 fine that was not paid was violative of his constitutional right to equal protection as he was unable to pay the fine due to indigency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In rendering an opinion on defendant's appeal of his sentence, the court found that the imposition of fines was constitutional because N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 484 specifically vested in sentencing judges the power to impose a fine and N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 718 provided that a convicted person could be detained in jail until the fine was paid for a period of time not to exceed one day for each $ 1 of the fine unpaid. The court noted that such additional detention after a maximum sentence for a failure to pay the fine had been sanctioned, not as a continuation of the period of imprisonment pursuant to the sentence, but on the specific ground that it was an effective means to enable the court to enforce the collection of the obligatory and properly imposed fine. However, when applied to indigent persons, &sect; 718 had the effect of a denial of equal protection because the inability to pay the fine resulted in indigents spending extended periods incarcerated merely because of a lack of funds, in opposition to the state law that required nondiscriminatory treatment of all defendants without regard to their financial worth. Thus, the court modified defendant's sentence by eliminating the fine penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners filed a declaratory judgment action (New York), requesting the court to direct defendant city to issue a permit for construction within a proposed mapped street bed. The landowners requested that the court declare that the city's refusal to permit the landowners to build on a proposed street bed constituted an appropriation of the landowners' property without just compensation or due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners alleged that the city's refusal to permit them to build on a proposed street bed constituted an appropriation of their property without just compensation or due process of law and was unconstitutional. The court found that the effect of the official city map lessened the value and limited the free and independent use of the landowners' property. The court additionally found that the proposed widening of the street at issue would be of little, if any, direct benefit to the landowners. The court concluded that if the landowners were required to set their building back, then for all practical purposes there would be a taking of a 14-foot strip. Once the building was erected, that 14-foot area, upon which the landowners were obliged to pay taxes, would be of no apparent practical or economic value. That factor alone would substantially damage the landowners. The court concluded that the landowners were entitled to relief. The court held that N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect; 35 and the official map of the city were unconstitutional and void to the extent that their application prevented the landowners from constructing the building within the area of the proposed street widening.</SPAN></P>

Section 35 of the General City Law which forbids the issuance of a permit for construction in the bed of a street laid out on a plan, the official map of defendant city and the ordinances establishing it take plaintiffs' property for public use without just compensation and are unconstitutional and void. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the committeeman's argument depended upon the application of the one person, one vote principle of law to the method of electing committeemen to comprise the committee. The principle required that seats in state legislatures be apportioned on a population basis and that political equality required that each person received one vote. The one person, one vote rule was also applicable to the apportionment of elected members of legislative bodies of governmental units below the level of state legislatures. The court held that entities such as the committee in question was not an entity to which the one person, one vote rule had been applied. A political committee could not be considered a legislative body of a governmental unit. The court held that the one person, one vote principle was not intended to be applicable to quasi public organizations and thus, the committeeman had no grounds to attack the constitutionality of N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 12. Additionally, because the committee was an unincorporated voluntary association in which no rights of property or personal liberty were involved, the court had no equitable jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding before the court, petitioner, a corporation that was a bidder of work involving repairing, painting, and refinishing (corporation), sought an order to direct respondent, a municipal board of education, to qualify the corporation as eligible for the award of a certain contract and to direct the board of education to execute the contract with the corporation as the low bidder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board of education had been notified, after investigations into bid rigging on public contracts, that a painting and decorating contractor had refused to sign a waiver of immunity. Such refusal, pursuant to law, automatically disqualified the contractor and any firm of which he was a member or officer from thereafter submitting bids to or receiving awards from any municipal corporation. Subsequently, the corporation submitted the lowest bid for alterations and repairs on a certain high school. It was discovered that the corporation &quot;fronted&quot; for the disqualified contractor. Consequently, the board of education advised the corporation that its request for qualification as a bidder was disapproved and that it was not the lowest responsible bidder for the contract. The court affirmed. The court found that (1) the fact that the corporation submitted the lowest bid did not, as a matter of law, establish it as the lowest responsible bidder; and (2) the board of education, as an awarding agency, had the duty of determining whether the corporation possessed integrity and moral worth or was, in fact, a front for the disqualified contractor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the corporation's application to be qualified as eligible for the award of the contract and vacated the stay.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- bids and bidders -- application for order directing Board of Education to qualify corporation as eligible low bidder for award of contract involving repair of school denied -- board found that individual who had been disqualified from bidding was real party in interest in affairs of corporation and latter was not lowest &quot;responsible&quot; bidder -- corporation had no property interest in contract by reason of submitting lowest bid, had no right to hearing and cannot attack constitutionality of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> relative to disqualification -- court may not interfere with lawful exercise of discretion by board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An application for an order directing the Board of Education of the City of New York to qualify petitioner, a corporation, as the eligible low bidder for the award of a contract involving repair of a school is denied.  Although petitioner's bid was the lowest submitted, an investigation by the board resulted in findings that a certain individual who had, because of refusal to waive immunity during an investigation as to bid rigging been disqualified, pursuant to section 103-b of the General Municipal Law, from bidding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on board work, was the real party in interest in petitioner's affairs, that petitioner acted for said individual in submitting the bid in question, and that petitioner was not the lowest &quot;responsible&quot; bidder (Education Law, &sect; 2556, subd. 10; General Municipal Law, &sect; 103, subd. 1) and, in the public interest, should not be given the award.  Petitioner did not obtain a property interest in the contract merely because it submitted the lowest bid and, accordingly, did not have the right to a hearing before being disqualified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since petitioner was not deprived of a property right, it cannot attack, as violative of due process, the provision of section 103-a of the General Municipal Law relative to automatic disqualification of a bidder who refuses to waive immunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The board's duty to determine the qualification of a bidder was a judicial function which was exhausted when it made a proper investigation and findings reasonably based thereon.  The court may not interfere with its lawful exercise of discretion. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, operators of a bar and grill located in a village, initiated proceedings against respondents, the village board of trustees, its mayor, and a building inspector, under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, to prohibit respondents from proceeding against petitioners under the State Standard Building Code For Places of Public Assembly (Building Code) and to review the action of respondents denying petitioners a permit for a curb lowering.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners were also owners of the real property containing the licensed premises. Petitioners alleged that the building inspector appeared at petitioners' bar and placed a hand-written sign upon an interior wall of the premises containing the following legend: &quot;Occupancy by more than 30 persons in bar, 32 persons in dining room was dangerous and unlawful.&quot; Respondents justified the action by citing N.Y. Labor Law &sect; 110 and &sect;&sect; 36-2.2(b)(10), (11) of the State Standard Building Code for Places of Public Assembly, N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 12, &sect; 36-2.2. The court held, however, that petitioners' premises did not come within any of the three categories enumerated in the N.Y. Labor Law &sect; 2(12). Petitioners further alleged discriminatory enforcement. The court noted that there were some 60 licensed bars in the village. Significantly, only petitioners' establishment had been so placarded and restricted. In the absence of any denial, the court was required to assume that to be so. As to respondents' refusal to issue a permit for a curb cut, the court held that respondents' action exhibited a pattern which could only be characterized as arbitrary, unreasonable, and capricious.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- limitation upon occupancy of bar and grill -- permit to lower curb -- Village of Port Chester may not invoke State Standard Building Code for Places of Public Assembly to justify imposition of limitation upon occupancy of bar and grill -- if there is danger of overcrowding, municipality should enforce local building code or enact appropriate legislation -- pattern of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is indicated -- rejection of application for permit to lower curb constituted deprivation of substantial property right without due process -- where use is lawful, act of granting permission to lower curbs is purely ministerial -- local authorities have available recourses if bar patrons engage in noisome offenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A bar and grill operated by petitioners in the Village of Port Chester is not a &quot;place of public assembly&quot; as defined in section 2 (subd. 12) of the Labor Law. Accordingly, section 36-2.2 (subd. [b], pars. [10], [11]) of the State Standard Building Code for Places of Public Assembly (12 NYCRR 36-2.2), applicable to such places, may not be cited by respondents, the said village and various officials thereof, to justify their&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  imposition of a limitation upon the occupancy of the said premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. If there is a danger of overcrowding, the municipality should enforce the applicable local building code or enact appropriate legislation. Furthermore, petitioners have operated the premises for four years and have been licensed by the State Liquor Authority, an agency known for its regulation of the physical characteristics of establishments under its jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Of some 60 licensed bars in the village, only that of petitioners has been restricted in occupancy. This indicates a pattern of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement which cannot be condoned.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the citizens, taxpayers, and qualified voters of Broome County, filed a motion for summary judgment in their action against defendant members of the Broome County Board of Supervisors (New York). Plaintiffs requested that the court declare unconstitutional and illegal the representation and voting procedure of the Board, and other relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that there was a gross disparity in population among the municipalities represented on the Board. Plaintiffs argued that the disparity resulted in an arbitrary impairment of the votes of plaintiffs and of all those similarly situated by means of an invidiously discriminatory geographic classification. Plaintiffs asserted that the discrimination deprived plaintiffs of liberty and property without due process of law and of the equal protection of the laws in violation of federal and state constitutions. The court held that the &quot;one person, one vote&quot; principle applied to the election of members of the Board, and the present apportionment with respect to the town supervisors and the districting of the city wards violated the equal protection provision of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1 and 11. The court rejected defendants' affirmative defense that the people had voted for such apportionment. The court held that an individual's constitutionally protected right to cast an equally weighted vote could not be denied even by a vote of a majority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared that the districting and apportionment of members of the Board violated state and federal Constitutions' equal protection provisions, but the Board would continue to function as constituted. Unless a constitutionally acceptable method of districting became effective prior thereto, the supervisors to be chosen at the next election were to be chosen under existing law. The court retained jurisdiction to review districting plans.</SPAN></P>

On Sundays the showroom was visited on an average by between 8 to 25 persons during the hours of noon to 5:00 p.m. in groups of approximately, two, four, six, or eight. Most of the contracts of sale were consummated at the customers' homes after their premises had been examined and their requirements precisely ascertained. At the time of defendant's arrest there were only two prospective customers on the premises who had come that day merely to &quot;browse around.&quot; The court found no violation of the Fourteenth Amendment by the selective prosecution of defendant because there was no pattern of discrimination consciously practiced.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, licensed pathologists and a pathology association, sought a judgment declaring certain provisions of 1964 N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs challenged N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 572 and N.Y. Pub. Health Law art. 5, tit. V, &sect; 579. The contention was that the statute required dual licensure of those licensed to practice medicine who engage in the specialty of pathology, while those who practice medicine in other fields needed only to possess a single license issued by the Department of Education. Plaintiffs sought a temporary injunction restraining defendant Commissioner of Health from enforcing against them the challenged provisions. The defendant cross-claimed for a dismissal of the complaint, or judgment on the pleadings. The court entered judgment on the pleadings in favor of the Commissioner. The court held that the state legislature passed the law to ensure safety in delivering healthcare to the public. The law was not arbitrary and was rationally related to a legitimate state interest of protecting the public from shoddy laboratory practices. The distinction between physicians who operated laboratories for use by others and those who had laboratories as adjuncts to their practices was a legitimate classification with a reasonable and rational basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners were the landlord and tenants of a housing project constructed and operated pursuant to N.Y. Priv. Hous. Fin. Law art. 2. The tenants sought review and annulment a determination of respondent, Commissioner of Housing and Community Renewal of the State of New York, which granted an increase in rents. The landlord sought review and modification of the order granting the increase because the increase was applied in two steps.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord filed an application for an increase in rent on the ground that the income from the privately funded project was insufficient to meet its requirement. The Commissioner approved the rent increase and stated that it was to be made in two steps. The tenants appealed the decision because they challenged the rent increase. The landlord challenged the requirement that it be made in two steps. The court found that there was a rational basis for the Commissioner's decision and denied and dismissed the petitions of the tenants and landlord. N.Y. Priv. Hous. Fin. Law &sect; 31(1)(a) contemplated that the rents might be varied and that there might be a deficiency in the payment to landlords which would be made up in a subsequent year, pursuant to N.Y. Priv. Hous. Fin. Law &sect; 28. It was a proper exercise of the Commissioner's discretion to have the increase in two steps to lessen the impact on the tenants. The fact that the power to do so was not specifically provided for under the law did not bar his action. A tax abatement matter set forth by the landlord was considered and, if secured, relief would be afforded to the tenants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an elector, filed a motion for summary judgment in his declaratory judgment action against defendants, a county board of supervisors and the State of New York, seeking a declaration that N.Y. County Law art. 4 was unconstitutional and that it was the duty of the board to formulate a system under which the vote of each supervisor would be proportionate to the number of persons represented by him. The board filed a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county consisted of 15 towns of varying populations. Each town had one supervisor with one vote on the board. The elector filed a complaint seeking reapportionment of the votes of the supervisors. The State was made a party defendant. The elector filed a motion for summary judgment and defendants filed a motion to dismiss. The court granted the elector's motion. The &quot;one person, one vote&quot; principle was applicable to the apportionment of elected members of boards of supervisors and other legislative bodies of governmental units below the level of State legislatures. The scheme of apportionment of the members of the board did not conform to the &quot;one person, one vote&quot; principle and was in violation of the U.S. Const. amend. XVI and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1 and 11. The court had jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action. Although the elector enjoyed an advantage by the scheme because the population of his town was less than 1/15th of the total population of the county, there were seven towns with populations less than his town. Because the relevant facts in the case were matters of public record, there was no issue of fact precluding summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered judgment for the elector.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested on a charge of disorderly conduct. After his arrest, he was searched by police and contraband was found on him. He was then charged with illegal possession. After a trial on the first charge, defendant was acquitted. During the trial on the possession charge, defendant filed motions to suppress the evidence found by the officer after the arrest for disorderly conduct and to dismiss the possession charge. The court granted the motions. The court rejected the State's argument that &quot;offenses&quot; were included in &quot;crimes&quot; for the purposes of 1963 N.Y. Laws &sect; 580, which amended N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 177. The court held that 1963 N.Y. Laws &sect; 580 did not change the fact that an acquittal of a charge involved in an original arrest invalidated the search which revealed the unrelated basis of a second charge. The court found that the search after the arrest for disorderly conduct was improper because defendant was acquitted on that charge. Therefore, the contraband had to be suppressed as fruits of the poisonous tree.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school districts awarded contracts to the plumbing contractor for the construction of new schools. Although the contractor submitted no plans for the contracts and made no application for a certificate of competency with plaintiff city, it obtained all of the required approvals from the state and began work on the schools. The trial court granted a preliminary injunction to the city, and the intermediate appellate court affirmed that order. But on appeal, the court dismissed the city's complaint and vacated the temporary injunction, holding that the contractor was not subject to the regulations of the city's Code. The court found that the legislature had preempted the area of plans and specifications and had vested that area exclusively in the state. Having conceded that it had no control over the plans and specifications, the city was not entitled to enforce the Code against the contractor when the issuance of the required permit and the inspection as provided in the Code was meaningless. The danger of harm from the construction of schools free from local ordinances was slight as compared to the frustration of the educational mandate through delays and interference.</SPAN></P>

The village also sought such an adjudication and an injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The area within the corporate limits of the village was a portion of the unincorporated area of the town prior to and on January 1, 1938, and also until the village was incorporated on June 21, 1962, pursuant to N.Y. Village Law art. 2. The town claimed exclusive zoning jurisdiction within the village pursuant to Nassau County, N.Y., County Charter &sect; 1606 and 1607. The village filed a complaint challenging the town's right to exercise zoning powers in the village under Nassau County, N.Y., County Charter &sect; 1606 and 1607. The town filed a counterclaim for adjudication of its rights. The court held that a reading of Nassau County, N.Y., County Charter &sect; 2601 and the stipulated facts in the case established that no county but Nassau County could qualify under Nassau County, N.Y., County Charter &sect; 2601 and proved that Nassau County, N.Y., County Charter &sect;&sect; 1606 and 1607 were local laws, and not general statutes. There was no reasonable ground for the creation of a separate class by local law that was contrary to N.Y. Village Law art. VI-A, &sect; 175 and N.Y. Town Law art. 16, &sect; 261. Therefore, Nassau County, N.Y., County Charter &sect; 1606 and 1607 violated N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 18.</SPAN></P>

None of the public employees was afforded an opportunity to explain, clarify, or attempt to justify his conduct or answers before the grand jury. Before they were discharged for alleged misconduct or incompetency, the public employees were each entitled to a hearing with notice of the charges against them, the right to representation by counsel, and a judicial review in accordance with N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the action concerning real property taxation laws, the court found that the city and the mayor had standing to bring the challenge to the statutes. The imposition and collection of real property taxes was of a local nature, as well as was the establishment and disbursement of the municipal budget. The court held that in its proprietary capacity, the city should not only be subject to the restraints and standards of a private individual but conversely should be granted the rights and privileges of the latter. Such privileges included the right to question a state statute that unquestionably affected the financial structure of the city. Accordingly, the duties of the mayor were altered by the legislation under attack, and as chief executive and fiscal officer of the city, his rights were directly affected.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Queens County Bar Association (Bar Association) sought summary judgment on plaintiff's suit to permanently enjoin the Bar Association from following it's plan to have a Bar Association poll to evaluate qualification and merit of candidates for judgeships and whether incumbent judges merited reelection, and if the incumbent merited reelection, to actively campaign for the judge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed suit to enjoin the Bar Association from proceeding with its plan to conduct and publish a bar poll concerning whether incumbent judges merited reelection, to evaluate judicial candidates, and to actively campaign for incumbent judges who were voted meritorious of reelection. The court granted the Bar Association's motion for summary judgment finding that the plan was consistent with the purposes of the Bar Association, including to promote a high standard of integrity, honor, and courtesy, and it did not violate the Penal Laws.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- indorsement by Bar Association -- adoption by Bar Association of Queens Plan for selection of Judges is not ultra vires -- Bar Association did not violate Penal Law ( &sect; 671) by implementing indorsement of candidate for judicial office by expending money to promote indorsed candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant Bar Association's adoption of the &quot;Queens Plan&quot; for the selection of Judges whereby if the members indorse a candidate for judicial office, money is expended by the Bar Association to promote his candidacy is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">ultra vires</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  The Membership Corporations Law provides that among the purposes of a Bar Association is &quot;facilitating the administration of justice&quot;.  The Canons of Professional Ethics impose on the Bar the duty &quot;to prevent political considerations from outweighing judicial fitness in the selection of Judges&quot;.  Defendant's certificate of incorporation states that one of its purposes is to promote the due administration of justice.  Its by-laws charge it to secure the election or appointment of qualified Judges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Subdivision 1 of section 671 of the Penal Law forbids a corporation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from using money in aid of a political party or any candidate for political office.  Fairly construed, there was no legislative intent to prevent defendant Bar Association from adopting the &quot;Queens Plan&quot;.  The intent of the Legislature was to eliminate political influence secured through financial contributions by large corporations.  The Bar Association did not violate section 671.  It is inconceivable that the Legislature would prescribe that one of the corporate purposes of a Bar Association is to facilitate the administration of justice and then make criminal the activity designed to effectuate that purpose.  Moreover, there was no political purpose involved in defendant's indorsement of a candidate, for it did not refer to the candidate's political affiliation but only the candidate himself.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mortgagor filed an action with the court to compel respondent mortgagee to accept payment of the unpaid principal amount of its mortgage out of an advance payment of an award for a property being taken by the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgagor sought to compel the mortgagee to accept payment of the unpaid principal of its mortgage out of an advance payment pursuant to the property's taking by the city with a four percent interest rate, in contravention to the six percent rate agreed upon by the parties in their contract. The court ruled in favor of the mortgagee. The court held that New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; B15-37.0 regarding the termination of contractual obligations pursuant to a taking by the city concerned only those covenants that touched and concerned the interest of the parties in the real property, not the award. The court stated that the compensation did not touch or concern the real estate. The freedom to contract was abridged only where the enforcement of the contract conflicted with dominant public interests. The court noted that the contract at bar involved no such interest or situation invoking the police power to promote or preserve the health, safety, and welfare of the public. The court held that the parties were free to contract for an apportionment of the award that reduced the share of that award going to the mortgagor in favor of the mortgagee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled in favor of the mortgagee in the mortgagor's action to compel payment of the principal and interest of the mortgage.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent domain -- apportionment of award -- mortgagor of condemned property contracted with mortgagee, prior to condemnation, that, in event thereof, mortgagor would pay principal plus 6% interest per annum to date of maturity; section B15-37.0 of Administrative Code of City of New York discharging contracts affecting condemned real property does not discharge such provision since it does not affect realty but only award -- by filing claim in condemnation, mortgagee does not seek greater award from city but seeks enforcement of mortgagor's contract -- no unjust enrichment of mortgagee is involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The owner of property, prior to its condemnation, entered into a mortgage loan agreement with the mortgagee which provided that, in the event of condemnation, the owner would pay the mortgagee the difference in interest received from the City of New York and the 6% per annum provided by the mortgage from the date of condemnation to the date of the maturity of the loan, May 7, 1967.  Such clause in the mortgage does not fall because of section B15-37.0 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, which provides that, where a parcel of real property is taken in condemnation, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  all contracts touching the same shall be discharged upon the vesting of title in the city.  The covenants discharged are those touching the interests of the parties in the real property and not in the award.  The clause in the mortgage here deals with apportionment of the award and does not concern the real estate or add to the obligation of the sovereign with respect to the award.  There is no public policy preventing mortgagor and mortgagee from providing, although the city is required to pay interest at 4%, that out of the award the mortgagee can take its unpaid principal and 6%, thereby reducing the share of the award going to the mortgagor. To interpret section B15-37.0 as nullifying the clause would result in an invalid application of an existing statute to the rights of parties to freely contract under Federal and State Constitutions due process clauses.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Fliegel </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Manhattan Sav. Bank</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 296 N. Y. 214, distinguished.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Even though the mortgagee has filed a claim in the condemnation proceeding, thereby electing to look to the city for payment, the mortgagee does not seek an additional award to be paid by city funds but seeks payment of the mortgage plus 6% to maturity&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  out of the advance payment made to the mortgagor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Freedom to contract in a market where lenders are in the keenest competition to place funds and the parties bargain in equality should not be invaded nor frustrated by mortgagor's plea of unjust enrichment which is in direct conflict with what the parties voluntarily contemplated.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner distributor sought a judgment, directing respondent Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York to issue a license for its film. The Board counterclaimed, seeking a declaration that: (1) the film was obscene within the meaning of N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 122; and (2) N.Y. Educ. Law &sect;&sect; 120-132 and the Board's Rule 221, N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 8, &sect; 12.9, as adopted March 26, 1965 were valid and constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The distributor applied to the Board for a license to exhibit its film. The Board's motion picture division found certain scenes to be obscene. The distributor requested a re-examination. The director of the division sustained the original determination. The distributor appealed to the Board and a committee thereof sustained the director's decision. The court noted that the U.S. Supreme Court had held that a system of movie censorship was required to contain certain procedural safeguards if it was not to run afoul of the First Amendment. These safeguards included a requirement that the censor have the burden of instituting judicial proceedings. The court held the statutory procedure for review in New York, incorporated in N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 124, was unconstitutional because it provided that a determination to deny a license was reviewable by a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding instituted by the applicant. The Board's rules also failed to contain the required procedural safeguards. However, in the absence of legislative authority incorporating the required procedural safeguards in the New York statutory scheme, the court declined to direct the issuance of a license to the distributor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the relief requested by the distributor, dismissed the portion of the Board's counterclaim that requested the court to declare the film obscene within the meaning of the Education Law, and declared that the procedure for review of films contained in the Education Law and the Board's Rules was invalid and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The film-licensing statute contained in part II of article 3 ( &sect;&sect; 120-132) of the Education Law, and section 221 of the Rules of the Board of Regents adopted thereunder, are unconstitutional in view of the decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Freedman </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Maryland</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (380 U.S. 259), in that the statute lacks (1) authority for the Board of Regents to institute &quot;within a specified brief period&quot; judicial action &quot;to restrain showing the film&quot; in the event that a license is not issued administratively since the &quot;burden of proving that the film is unprotected expression must rest on the censor&quot; and not upon the applicant as section 124 of the Education Law now establishes; and (2) a judicial procedure to &quot;assure a prompt final judicial decision, to minimize the deterrent effect of an interim and possibly erroneous denial of a license&quot;, a safeguard&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of definite time limits to be imposed by the Legislature.  By its rule 221, the Board of Regents sought to change the effect of section 124 of the Education Law which provides that the applicant for the license must commence the judicial review proceeding, which change the board may not effect by rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner's argument that a license must be directed for its film upon the ground that licensing per se is not unconstitutional is rejected.  Such a direction would force the court to impel approval of a motion picture found to be obscene by the Board of Regents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The nature of this proceeding and current case law requires that the proceeding be passed upon by the court and not remitted to the Appellate Division for determination.  </SPAN></P>
