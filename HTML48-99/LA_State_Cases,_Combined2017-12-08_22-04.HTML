</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case involved a filiation and support action brought by plaintiff mother against defendant, the alleged biological father of a minor. Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Court of Appeal, Fifth Circuit, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which reversed the trial court's judgment dismissing the case for failure to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A child was born while the mother was physically separated from her husband, but not divorced. She was cohabitating with defendant, the alleged biological father, at the time. Several years later, the mother brought this filiation and support action against the alleged biological father. The father filed a peremptory exception raising the objections of no cause of action and no right of action. The trial court sustained the exception and dismissed the action, invoking La. Civ. Code art. 184, which provided that the husband of the mother was presumed to be the father of all children born or conceived during the marriage. The court of appeal reversed the judgment, applying the concept of dual paternity, and held that the biological father had an obligation to support his child. On further review, the court affirmed. The issue was whether the biological father was obligated to provide support for his child notwithstanding that the child was conceived or born during the mother's marriage to another person and thus the legitimate child of that other person. Answering in the affirmative, the court found that the mother stated a valid cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court reversal of the trial court's judgment dismissing the mother's action for filiation and support, and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The appealing parties sought a determination of whether statutes governing pilotage fee commissions were an infringement on the power of the Commission to adopt its own rules, regulations, and procedures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, industry commissioners of a pilotage fee commission who received power to set fees and rates by the legislature, certified a fee dispute to defendant public service commission (Commission), a member of each fee commission who resolved rate disputes when there was a deadlock between industry and pilot commissioners who comprised a pilotage fee commission's membership. Plaintiffs filed a petition for a temporary restraining order, declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against the State and the Commission in the district court. Pilot members of various pilot fee commissions intervened. The district court granted a temporary restraining order to plaintiffs and held that some laws relating to pilotage fee commissions were unconstitutional and violative of due process. The Commission, the State and intervenors appealed. The court reversed holding that the legislature, under La. Const. art. 4, &sect; 21(B), allowed the Commission authority over pilotage fees as part of its &quot;other regulatory authority.&quot; The court also held that the State had a legitimate interest in safe pilotage on its waters, thus the State's pilotage fee legislation did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the State of Louisiana Attorney General and the Office of Employment Security, appealed an order from the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which declared that the application of the prior claim filing requirement of the Louisiana Employment Security Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1601(2) against plaintiff claimants violated the equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. 14 and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two claimants were discharged from their jobs with their initial employers for reasons that disqualified them from receiving unemployment benefits. Neither filed a claim for benefits. Both claimants obtained new jobs and were discharged under non-disqualifying circumstances prior to having worked for a period of time that entitled them to benefits from their new employers. Both claimants applied for benefits and were denied because they had failed to file for benefits after their terminations from their initial employers, as required by &sect; 23:1601(2). The claimants filed their action for benefits in the district court. The district court held that &sect; 23:1601(2) violated the federal and state equal protection clauses and awarded benefits to claimants. Defendants appealed. The court rejected defendants' challenges to the court's lack of jurisdiction over the claimant's action. The portion of &sect; 23:1601(2) that created the prior claim requirement violated the claimants' equal protection rights because there was no rational relation to a legitimate state interest in the treating claimants differently from others who were entitled to receive benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that the prior claim requirement was unconstitutional and affirmed the district court's order that required the Office to pay the claimants unemployment benefits.

The taxpayers contended that the court erred in holding that there was no such credit and, therefore, there was no loss of inheritance taxes to the state. The taxpayers contended that the use of the word &quot;state&quot; in the statute included any political subdivision of the state. The court held that under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 47:2401 and 47:2432(A), where there was a credit under the federal statute, and the credit exceeded the state taxes, no payment was due. If, however, the federal credit did not exceed the amount of taxes due, the excess must be paid to the state. The court, therefore, concluded that the taxpayers were required to pay the state the inheritance taxes and the estate transfer taxes on the entire amount and, therefore, there was no loss of revenue to the state due to the federal credit.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1504 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A volunteer fire department brought suit to enjoin a parish ordinance that was contrary to a statute, which funded the fire district. The fire department urged that the Parish made no effort to comply with Act 454 in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1504, which required the Parish to use tax revenues collected for fire protection. On review, the court held the statute clearly met the initial test for a local law, as its operation was limited solely by its designation of parishes. As the statute dealt with apportionment of tax revenues, it fell into none of the categories of state local laws. Also, it was specifically authorized by La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 9. Finally, the governance of a fire district did not violate a home rule charter because fire control was a function of the State's police power. The court held the Parish failed to meet its burden of proving the unconstitutionality of Act 454 by clear and convincing evidence. The court held that Act 454 was not a local law that fell within the prohibited categories of La. Const. art. III, &sect; 12. The court also held the statute did not impermissibly infringe on local affairs of a home rule government contrary to La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>

The doctor settled before trial. A jury awarded damages in excess of the damages cap. The trial court reduced the award in accordance with the cap, and the Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit, Parish of Orleans, Louisiana affirmed. A writ of review was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured minor was injured at birth in a private hospital. The court affirmed the reduction of the jury's award in compliance with the caps on recovery in medical malpractice claims. The court held that the $ 400,000 limitation on recovery from the Patient's Compensation Fund was a valid restriction. The court found that the legislature had the power to establish the fund which provided a supplemental recovery for those more seriously injured by medical malpractice. As to future medical care, the court stated that because the injured minor was born at a private hospital, his future medical care and related benefits were placed in a different category than those claims originating from a public hospital. The court held that had he been injured in a state facility under the care of a state employee, his future medical expenses could have been recovered, and that this was a clear violation of the Louisiana constitutional guarantee of equal protection. The court amended the award to grant any future medical expenses and related benefits according to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.43.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was issued an unrestricted driver's license by the public safety department, despite the fact that the driver was known to have seizures. Later, the public safety department automatically renewed his license without another medical exam. The driver hit the injured parties' vehicles during a seizure and they brought an action against the driver and the public safety department. The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the injured parties. The court found that the public safety department's failure to monitor the driver's medical condition was a cause in fact of the accident. The court held that the public safety department, when it was aware of a driver's seizure condition, had a duty to adopt reasonable procedures designed to ensure safety on the highways, both in the initial issuance of a license and in the continuation of the authority to drive. The court noted that the public safety department breached its duty by failing to adopt adequate monitoring provisions. Finally, the court determined that the risk that the driver could harm other motorists was clearly within the scope of the protection contemplated by the imposition of the duty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Louisiana appealed a judgment of the Court of Appeal, Second Circuit (Louisiana), which affirmed defendant's convictions for attempted aggravated rape, aggravated crime against nature, and attempted second degree murder. The appellate court determined that the evidence was insufficient to support defendant's conviction for aggravated kidnapping and it remanded the case for resentencing on simple kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant kidnapped the victim from a parking lot and drove her to a nearby apartment complex and raped her. The appellate court held that defendant was not guilty of aggravated kidnapping because it found no evidence that defendant forced the victim to engage in sexual intercourse in order to secure her release. It reduced the kidnapping charge to simple kidnapping. The court reversed, holding that the elements of aggravated kidnapping were the forcible seizing and the carrying of any person from one place to another with the intent to force the victim to give up anything of apparent present or prospective value in order to secure the release of that person. The court found that all of the elements of aggravated kidnapping were present in the instant case and that the crucial question in determining whether an aggravated kidnapping had occurred was whether defendant sought to obtain something of value, be it sex or money or otherwise, by playing upon the victim's fear and hope of eventual release in order to gain compliance with his demands. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of aggravated kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's judgment insofar as it set aside defendant's conviction for aggravated kidnapping and remanded the case for resentencing for simple kidnapping. The court reinstated defendant's conviction for aggravated kidnapping and affirmed the remaining portions of the appellate court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On application of defendant Department of Public Safety and Corrections, Division of State Police, the court granted certiorari to review a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Louisiana, Fifth Circuit, Parish of St. Charles, which affirmed a district court's issuance of an injunction barring the enforcement of criminal statutes that made gambling illegal. The court considered the validity of such an injunction in general and in the case at bar.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As plaintiff charitable organization was holding a &quot;Las Vegas Night,&quot; state police entered the premises, seized gambling machines, and threatened to arrest anyone conducting such activities again. On review, the court held that there were three requirements for the issuance of an injunction such as was issued: the statute had to be manifestly unconstitutional, irreparable injury was threatened, and existing property rights would be destroyed by enforcement. The most compelling basis for not issuing such injunctions was the constitutional requirement of separation of powers, La. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 1, 2. Absent a showing of extraordinary necessity, courts refrained from interfering via injunction with the prerogatives of the other branches of government. Although the district court did not identify what statutes were not to be enforced, the organization failed to show that any statute was manifestly unconstitutional. It did not specifically identify any fatal ambiguity in any statute. Nor was any potentially applicable statute unconstitutional due to vagueness or ambiguity. The organization's allegation that statutes were being enforced arbitrarily and capriciously was frivolous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgments of the court of appeal and the district court, vacated the injunction, and dismissed the suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed a judgment from the 25th Judicial District Court, Parish of Plaquemines (Louisiana), finding that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:424 was unconstitutionally vague and violated the separation powers. The court dismissed the bills of information against defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with harvesting oysters from closed waters in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:424. The district court found that &sect; 56:424 was unconstitutional and quashed the bills of information. On appeal to the supreme court, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that an &quot;ordinary person&quot; of &quot;reasonable intelligence&quot; was capable of understanding what he must do in order to comply with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:424(E). Compliance merely entailed taking oysters only from waters approved by the state health officer. No citizen was called upon to determine, at his peril, what waters should be closed because of pollution. Section 56:424 provided clear standards for determining the guilt or innocence of the accused and proper notice of closed and open waters was given. Second, the court held that the delegation was proper because the rules, regulations, and standards actually adopted by the state health officer were reasonable and in keeping with the legislative mandate. The statute stated a precise legislative purpose and contained guidance for administrative officials. In addition, the statute limited the authority of the administrative officer.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment for the doctor. On appeal, the appellate court affirmed. A writ was granted to consider whether the trial and appellate courts correctly interpreted La. Rev.

The court then held that, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.40, the doctor was required to disclose all known material risks to the patient, but only if the risk foreseeably might result in death, brain damage, quadriplegia, paraplegia, the loss or loss of function of any organ or limb, or disfiguring scars, in order to qualify the written consent for the presumption of validity.

Defendant pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of manslaughter and to the attempted first degree murder of the man's wife. Defendant's motion to withdraw her plea was denied and defendant was sentenced to the maximum sentences for each conviction, to be served consecutively. A divided court of appeal affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the prosecutor informed defense counsel on the day of defendant's trial that he filed a supplemental charge of attempted first degree murder, plea negotiation began anew, and defense counsel offered to accept a previous offer of a 21 year sentence, concurrent with 20 years on the new charge. The prosecutor stated he had no objection to concurrent sentences, but did not discuss the bargain with the judge. Defendant's consent to the guilty plea was based on representations by her attorneys that she would receive concurrent sentences. The state supreme court found that the evidence established a reasonable and justifiable basis for defendant's belief in her attorneys' representation that her sentence would not exceed 21 years if she pleaded guilty to both charges. The trial judge had the discretion to reject the plea bargain, even if the parties had been in complete agreement as to the terms. However, the judge did not have discretion both to reject the bargain and to refuse to allow defendant to withdraw her plea which was based on her reasonable belief that she would be sentenced to concurrent sentences in accordance with the bargain. Thus, the sentences were set aside.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentences were set aside. The case was remanded to the district court for the original trial judge either to grant defendant's motion to withdraw the guilty plea or to sentence defendant to the concurrent sentences that she reasonably believed she would receive when she entered the guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Rehearing was granted to reconsider whether art. IV, &sect; 21(B), by explicitly granting to the Commission the full authority over &quot;all public utilities,&quot; removed the ability of the legislature to alter the Commission's jurisdiction over any business defined as a public utility at the time the 1974 constitution was adopted. The court concluded that it did and insofar as La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45:1163 was inconsistent with that plenary authority, it was unconstitutional. The court held that the cooperatives' argument that they were not the kind of utilities intended to be subject to regulation was undercut by the very statute they sought to have upheld as constitutional. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45:1163(B) allowed electric cooperatives to choose to have rates and services regulated by the Commission under the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12:426. If the structure and function of those cooperatives were such that regulation were unnecessary, it would have been illogical for the legislature to have exempted them from regulation in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45:1163(A) and yet provided for them to choose to be regulated in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 45:1163(B) and 12:426.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for murder, based on an eyewitness's photographic lineup identification. Certain photographs used in the photographic lineup were lost prior to defendant's second trial regarding guilt and his third trial regarding sentence. On a motion to quash the indictment, defendant argued that he had no chance to effectively impeach the testimony of the identification witnesses at trial, because the jury was not able to assess the lineup for suggestiveness. The motion was denied. The trial court concluded that the photographs were lost and that the State had done everything in its power to locate and produce them. This ruling was correct. The State did not cause the photographs to be lost. At trial, the parties stipulated that the Clerk of the Court's Office lost the photographs and that they were not lost by either the State or defendant. Pertinent to the determination that defendant's indictment need not be quashed was the fact that the supreme court reviewed the photographs and allegations regarding them in the appeal of defendant's first conviction and sentence and found that they were not unduly suggestive and that they did not taint the in-court identification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendants, a political candidate and a political group president, with one count each of violating La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The president's political group sent a letter during an election that supported the candidate and made negative statements about the opposing candidate and included a picture of opposing team politicians stating that the opposing team should be &quot;broken before the team broke them.&quot; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:1463(B), (C) restricted activities during elections in such a manner, for example impairing anonymity by forbidding anonymous false statements designed to mislead voters, so as to be a violation of the First Amendment right to free speech and Louisiana's counterpart, La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7. Sections 18:1463(B), (C) were not sufficiently narrowly drawn to avoid specific and targeted evils. The First Amendment's focus was to allow for the free exchange of ideas relating to the political process. The State's justification argument, to see that voters were informed of the source of statements so the voters could properly evaluate those statements, was not sufficiently narrowly defined so as to be so compelling as to tip the balance in favor of free speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court, on the prosecutor's motion, instituted a special procedure, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:283, to take the child's testimony outside the courtroom. Defendant was found guilty of indecent behavior with a juvenile. The trial court denied defendant's motion for a new trial. Defendant appealed. The Court of Appeal, First Circuit, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), affirmed the conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question was the constitutionality of &sect; 15:283 in light of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Coy v. Iowa. The Louisiana Supreme Court held that the Coy decision required reversal of defendant's conviction. As written and as applied in the case at bar, the statute, which contained only a non-specific &quot;when justice so requires&quot; standard for applicability, clearly violated defendant's constitutional right of confrontation under the Coy decision. The remaining issue was whether the violation of defendant's right to face-to-face confrontation constituted harmless error. The evidence, other than the child's testimony in court, consisted of her hearsay statements to her mother and to the police, as well as the mother's testimony that the vaginal area &quot;looked red,&quot; and the child's stepfather's testimony that the child was sitting on defendant's lap alone in the room when the stepfather arrived at defendant's home on the evening in question. There were no vaginal tears or abrasions or other physical evidence indicating abuse. The supreme court concluded that the remaining evidence fell short of establishing that the confrontation error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant doctor was indicted for 37 counts of computer fraud. His motion to quash alleging that La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14:73.5 was unconstitutional was denied by the trial court. On appeal, the Court of Appeal, Third Circuit, Parish of Lafayette (Louisiana) reversed the trial court's ruling. Plaintiff state's application was granted, and the case was docketed as an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found the last phrase in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:73.5(A)(2) and the definition of access in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:73.1(1) were unconstitutionally vague. Since the definition of access was applicable throughout La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:73.5, the appeals court reasoned that the entire statute could not withstand constitutional scrutiny and had to fall. The definition of access was not unconstitutionally vague. Section 14:73.1(1) offered a clear and definite standard of conduct. In looking at &sect; 14:73.5, an ordinary person of reasonable intelligence would not be capable of discerning what type of conduct was prohibited under the last phrase of that statute. That phrase was unconstitutionally vague. However, that did not mean that the entire statute had to fall. The instant court found that the phrase &quot;or through the alteration, deletion, or insertion of programs or data&quot; could be severed from the statute without affecting the legislative intent behind the computer fraud statute. That being the case, the rest of the statute remained constitutional. The appellate court erred in finding that the entire statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), granted defendant's motion to quash on the ground that &sect; 14:105 was unconstitutionally vague. The State appealed, and the State's appeal was transferred to the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:105 defined letting a disorderly place as the granting of the right to use any premises knowing that the premises was to be used as a disorderly place or allowing the continued use of the premises with such knowledge. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:104 defined keeping a disorderly place as the intentional maintaining of a place to be used habitually for any illegal purpose. The supreme court found that, reading &sect; 14:104 and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:105 in pari materia, it could be inferred that a disorderly place was one used habitually for any illegal purpose. The definition of a disorderly place as one which was used habitually for an illegal purpose was not unconstitutionally vague. However, the indictment should have specified the nature of the disorder. Because of the multitude of illegal purposes which could have been served by a disorderly place, the bill of information in defendant's case was deficient and was correctly quashed by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife argued that the prescription period was interrupted because the doctor learned in 1980 that the wife was in danger of developing cancer of the bladder, but failed to disclose this information to her. The state supreme court held that the prescription period could have been interrupted, if the doctor learned of vital information regarding the wife's health, but failed to disclose that information to her. Thus, the claim should not have been dismissed without the wife and husband first having an opportunity, as provided by La. Code of Civ. Proc. art. 934, to amend their petition to allege facts which would remove the grounds for granting the exception of prescription. Further, the husband and wife should have been allowed to amend their petition in order to assert their claim that the doctor violated a fiduciary duty to the wife, and was liable for damages to the extent that his nondisclosure prevented her from timely discovering her bladder condition and seeking preventive treatment for the same.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff attorney sued defendant city, challenging the constitutionality of an annual occupational license tax upon certain professions, including attorneys. The Fourteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Calcasieu, ruled the license tax unconstitutional. The city and intervenor state municipal association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney claimed that the tax was a municipal income tax violative of La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4(C), and interfered with the state supreme court's right to regulate the practice of law. The supreme court held that a major distinction between an occupation tax and an income tax was that the former was an indirect tax, and the latter was a direct tax. Further, a municipal business or occupation tax was a tax upon the activity in a particular calling or business, and was not a tax upon the property involved in the business. Moreover, the fact that the occupation tax in the present case was calculated on the basis of annual gross receipts did not of itself transform the indirect tax on the business activity into a direct tax upon income. Specifically, such calculation was one of the permissible means a taxing unit may have used in providing for greater equality and more uniformity in imposing the tax. As to the claim that the tax constituted an improper regulation of the practice of law, the state supreme court held that a license to practice law did not confer immunity from taxation; the license did not exempt the attorney from the duties of sharing in the expenses of government.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court was reversed. The attorney's suit was dismissed at his cost.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed several pretrial motions in his trial on two of the remaining counts in an original indictment of first degree murder. The trial judge denied all motions, and petitioner sought writs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner's motions were: (1) a motion to be declared mentally incompetent to proceed to trial; (2) a motion to sever counts one and two; (3) a motion to quash evidence of the four prior murder convictions as aggravating circumstances; and (4) a motion to quash his confession and evidence of unrelated and unadjudicated crimes as character and propensity evidence. His application raised 10 assignments of error and a post-argument assignment of error. The court granted writs and found that, with the exception of assignment eight, his assignments were without merit. Assignment eight contended that the trial court erred in refusing to restrict the state's use of &quot;propensity and character&quot; evidence and/or in the alternative, refusing to quash the statute because there was no defined standard of proof (which should be beyond a reasonable doubt) by which such &quot;propensity&quot; evidence was to be given to the jury. The court concluded that guidelines to help in determining the admissibility of unadjudicated crimes at sentencing were necessary and thus adopted standards to govern the introduction of such crimes as character and propensity evidence under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rulings of the trial court on defendant's pretrial motions were upheld, with the exception that the trial court had to determine whether evidence of unadjudicated crimes was admissible at sentencing in accord with the principles set out in the court's opinion. It remanded for proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a motor vehicle owner, was the owner of two motor vehicles registered in Louisiana. When he paid the license tax to renew the vehicle registrations, he was assessed a $ 2 per vehicle handling fee, as provided by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:503(C), in addition to the tax owed. The motor vehicle owner subsequently filed an action, which sought a declaration that the handling fee was unconstitutional, refund of the handling fees paid, and attorney fees. The matter was certified as a class action. The State filed a peremptory exception to the action, urging several objections: no cause of action, no right of action, failure to join an indispensable third party, mootness, and a dilatory exception for prematurity. The lower court held that &sect; 47:503(C) was unconstitutional. The court reversed in part, affirmed in part as modified, and remanded. The court ruled that the handling fee imposed by &sect; 47:503(C) violated both the letter and spirit of La. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder by a jury in the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana). The jury recommended the death penalty having found two statutory aggravating circumstances: (1) that defendant was engaged in the perpetration of an armed robbery; (2) that defendant knowingly created a risk of death or great bodily harm to more than one person. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim and her friends, tourists visiting New Orleans for Mardi Gras, were eating chicken at a fast food restaurant parking lot. Defendant approached them with a .357 magnum pistol and ordered them to give him their money. Three friends put their money on the hood of the car. The victim said she had no money. Defendant said, &quot;You better,&quot; or &quot;You gotta,&quot; then shot the victim point blank in the face. He grabbed the money and fled. An anonymous tip led police to defendant and the gun. Affirming the conviction, the court held that the evidence supported the jury's finding of a specific intent to kill, although defendant claimed that the gun just &quot;went off.&quot; He made a threatening statement to the victim prior to firing; one witness testified that she actually saw defendant pull the trigger of the gun. The trial court's instruction regarding intent merely set out a permissive inference which left the jury free to credit or reject the inference; the instruction did not shift the burden of proof. Although during the sentencing phase defendant's counsel only gave a very brief closing and did not present any witnesses, the court could not say that his assistance was ineffective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court unanimously affirmed defendant's conviction. A majority, not a unanimous court, affirmed the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision from the Thirtieth Judicial District Court, Parish of Vernon (Louisiana) denying post-conviction relief. Defendant had been convicted of first-degree murder. A sentencing hearing was conducted before the same jury that determined the issue of guilt. The jury unanimously recommended a death sentence. On direct appeal, the Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from denial of post-conviction relief following a conviction for first-degree murder and sentence to death, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and vacated the sentence. At trial, the State proved defendant deliberately shot, robbed, and killed a retired military policeman. The court held that even if a defendant could prove counsel error, he still must prove actual prejudice before relief was granted. Also, a capital sentencing proceeding was sufficiently like a trial in its adversarial format and in the existence of standards for decision that counsel's role in the two proceedings was comparable, i.e., to ensure that the adversarial testing process worked to produce a just result. Despite having pled defendant's ongoing emotional problems in a pretrial motion, counsel did not obtain defendant's medical records. Further, trial counsel's representation at the sentencing hearing revealed no discernible strategy. In order to effectively represent defendant, the jury should have been presented with available statutory mitigating circumstances. Psychiatric mitigating evidence not only could act in mitigation, it also could significantly weaken the aggravating factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for first-degree murder. The court vacated defendant's death sentence. Further, the court remanded the matter for a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which found him guilty of first degree murder, claiming that he was denied a fair trial, and that he was improperly assessed the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot and killed the victim during a drug deal. Defendant was found guilty of first degree murder and appealed his conviction, arguing that he was denied a fair trial and that the death penalty was illegally imposed. The court held that the trial court did not err in excluding jurors who refused to impose the death penalty because under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 798, a death-qualified jury did not violate defendant's right to a jury representing a cross-section of the community. The court also determined that the prosecution's expert witness did not testify about matters beyond his field of expertise or usurp the jury's function in determining a crucial issue at trial because the expert's testimony on how the victim was shot was not contested during trial and was not a crucial issue. In addition, the court stated that defendant's specific intent to commit murder was correctly inferred by defendant pointing a gun at the victim and pulling the trigger. Finally, the court concluded that the jury was justified in assessing the death penalty against defendant because of the aggravated circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder based upon his participation in an armed robbery. At the time of the offense, defendant was 15 years old. On the morning of the sentencing phase of his trial, he entered into an agreement under which he would testify for the State at the trial of his co-perpetrator. In exchange, the State agreed to abandon any effort to obtain the death penalty, and agreed to a sentence of life imprisonment. At the time of the trial however, defendant refused to testify. The trial court granted the State's motion to re-impanel the jury for sentencing. The court granted review, and reversed. The court held that it was a violation of the Eighth Amendment to execute a defendant who was under the age of 16 at the time that he committed the offense. The court followed the opinion of the United States Supreme Court in a similar case involving an Oklahoma law. The court pointed out that the statutory scheme in Louisiana, which allowed a minor under the age of 16 to be tried as an adult was similar to that employed in Oklahoma. The court did not reach the issue of whether the procedural rules permitted the trial court to re-impanel the jury.</SPAN></P>

The cooperatives sought those laws to be decreed constitutional pursuant to La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 21(B).

The court reasoned that &sect; 23:1634(A) provided an incentive to timely file the administrative record by requiring the payment of benefits that would otherwise not have been due and that any interpretation of this provision that would have allowed the administrator to pass that cost to any employer would have violated due process because the employers could not control the administrator's preparation and filing of the record. The court also held that the benefits under &sect; 23:1634(A) could have been considered to be administrative expenses because they arose from the administrative problem on not timely producing the record and that those benefits could have been paid for from two funds for the payment of administrative expenses that were not funded by taxes that were levied against the employers.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled that the statute was unconstitutional because, by banning only those recordings done by private citizens while permitting those done by law enforcement agents, it created an arbitrary and unreasonable classification prohibited by the equal protection clauses of both the federal and state constitutions. The State appealed. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.

The court affirmed his conviction and death sentence. The trial court properly denied defendant's challenge for cause of three prospective jurors because defendant failed to establish that he was prejudiced by the failure to rehabilitate one particular prospective juror, as defendant did not exhaust his peremptory challenges and the juror did not serve on the jury. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress his second taped statement because defendant indicated on the tape that he freely gave the statement and the evidence indicated that his codefendant was not in the room when the statement was made. The State proved aggravated rape, as defendant stated that he took the boy's shorts off and had sexual encounters with him before defendant and his companion shot the child. The sexual acts and the subsequent homicide formed one continuous transaction, which was sufficient to establish first-degree murder. The court also affirmed defendant's death sentence because the sentence was not disproportionate when compared to similar cases in the parish.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee applied for unemployment compensation benefits, which were denied.

The Office of Employment Security failed to file the administrative record within 60 days as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1634A, and the employee filed a petition to require the Office to commence payment of benefits under the statute. The trial court denied the petition on the ground that &sect; 23:1634A was unconstitutional, and the employee appealed to the court pursuant to La. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(D). The court held that the purpose of the unemployment compensation laws was to spread the cost of the benefit, which was for the good of the community, across all employers. The court held that penalizing a particular employer by requiring it to pay benefits as a penalty for the failure of the Office, over which the employer had no control, to file an administrative record, defied the purpose of the laws and unfairly penalized the employer. The court held that only the penalty provision of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1634A was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held the ordinance unconstitutional. The council appealed directly to the court. Upon review, the court held that the ordinance was valid under La. Rev. Stat.

The ex-husband argued that the pension fund was not subject to seizure under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2302 and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2381. The trial court dissolved the writ. The court of appeal affirmed. On appeal to the supreme court, the court reversed.

The ex-wife could not wrongfully seize a sum of money half of which she co-owned and which the holder refused to divide.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to possession of controlled dangerous substances. The State sought an order forfeiting defendant's ownership of the vehicle and cash money found on his person at the time of his arrest. Relying on La. Rev. Stat.

The court affirmed the forfeiture of defendant's vehicle but reversed insofar as the judgment allowed the forfeiture of currency and remanded for a new trial in order for the State to have the opportunity to prove, without the benefit of the presumption, that the currency was contraband. The State sufficiently proved that the vehicle was forfeitable contraband within the meaning of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:1550(A)(5), (C)(3). However, the statutory presumption embodied in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:1550(A)(7)(c) was invalid because it infringed upon due process rights and property interest protected by the state constitution.

The trial court agreed and granted the motion to quash. The trial court's ruling was based exclusively on its view that the words &quot;not limited to&quot; in the statutory description of the area where the oyster seed grounds were located made it impossible to determine the location of designated oyster seed grounds. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The statutory provision was not unconstitutionally vague when it was considered within its regulatory context. A reasonable person was given adequate notice by the law that he must refer to the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Commission's regulations designating oyster seed grounds before he could safely proceed to take oysters from what he presumed to be an oyster seed ground.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners had a four-plex apartment building in an area zoned for two-family dwellings. Two of the apartments were vacant for eight months, during which time they were repainted, repaired, and refurbished. The neighbors filed suit to enjoin the owners from re-letting the two vacant apartments, and argued that the nonconforming use status of the four-plex was abated under the city zoning ordinance. The trial court ruled in favor of the neighbors, and the court of appeal affirmed. On further review, the court reversed and held that under the ordinance, the four-plex was a building used in whole for nonconforming purposes. The court interpreted the ordinance to provide that the building did not lose its nonconforming status unless the entire building remained vacant for more than six consecutive months. The court reasoned that the court of appeal's interpretation would have taken the two vacant apartments out of commerce until the leases expired on the other apartments, regardless of the term of those other leases. The court concluded that such an interpretation would have also discouraged property owners from refurbishing apartments in buildings with nonconforming use status.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the state proved each and every element of the crime, including specific intent to kill. The number and severity of the stab wounds compelled the conclusion that the victim was not killed accidentally or incident to a struggle. It was permissible for the state to offer evidence of the defendant's prior convictions during the penalty phase. La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.2. Although there was corroborating evidence as to only four of the seven prior convictions, the admission of the additional three was not prejudicial.

The legislation was enacted by only a majority of the legislature, not by the two-thirds as required by the constitution. The court held that the legislation was constitutional because the revenue anticipation notes did not constitute &quot;debt&quot; within the context and meaning of the constitution. The court determined that the legislation attempted to authorize the State's bond commission to issue and sell revenue anticipation notes to avoid temporary cash flow deficits and to provide a working balance in the State general fund to enable the state to pay expenses in a timely manner from currently budgeted and appropriated revenues of the state general fund.

The parties entered into a settlement agreement by which the State returned more than half of the acreage to the Association. The Association filed the instant action when the Board began advertising for mineral leasing on the property. The court reversed the judgments of the lower courts, holding that the lower courts erred in concluding that the Association had no cause of action on the grounds that the State was constitutionally prohibited from selling or exchanging any mineral rights by virtue of La. Const. art. 9, &sect; 4(A) (1974). The court concluded that art. 9, &sect; 4(A) did not affect the mineral interest in the subject property because the transaction involved a compromise agreement and not a sale or exchange.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgments of the lower courts and overruled the peremptory exceptions. The court remanded the action to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the debtors' motion and the lower court denied review. The court granted certiorari to review the trial court's ruling and reversed. The court held that the service of the motion and order to examine the debtors was not valid because the attorney of record was not (1) a registered agent for service of process; (2) an officer, director, or resident agent named in the articles of incorporation or in the last report previously filed with the Secretary of State; or (3) an employee, as contemplated by art. 1261. Moreover, there was no service on the Secretary of State under art. 1262.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff City of New Orleans appealed a judgment of the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which, in the City's declaratory judgment action, held that the New Orleans Earnings Tax Ordinance, New Orleans, La., City Code art. VII, was unconstitutional under La. Const. of 1974, art. VII, &sect; 4(C) because it imposed an income tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax ordinance imposed a tax of 1.5 percent of annual gross earnings, in excess of $ 5,000, of every person working in the City of New Orleans. On appeal, the court held that the tax ordinance operated for a vast majority of the people as a tax upon their only source of income, their earnings. The consequence was to deprive them of a part of their income. In determining if the tax was a prohibited income tax that operational and consequential effect had to be given paramount consideration. Neither art. VII, &sect; 4(C) nor statutory law clarified the term &quot;income tax,&quot; but the court held that the term was not used in art. VII, &sect; 4(C) in a technical sense. In its usual sense, giving attention to the general and popular use of the words, there was no ambiguity. The decisive element was how the tax operated. Nor did the fact that the state imposed its income tax on net income mitigate against the constitutional prohibition preventing cities from imposing a tax on a particular source or type of income or on its gross amount as distinguished from its net amount. The court held that the tax ordinance violated art. VII, &sect; 4(C) and its unconstitutionality rendered it a nullity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the district court holding the tax ordinance unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the prosecutor could not use the fact of an accused's exercise of his constitutional right to remain silent, after he was advised of his right, solely to ascribe a guilty meaning to the silence or to undermine by inference an exculpatory version related by the accused for the first time at trial. The court found that the prosecutor attempted to use the fact of defendant's silence to persuade the jury that defendant had nothing to say in his defense, although the silence might merely have meant that defendant was relying on the arresting officer's assurance that he had the right to remain silent. The court found, however, that defendant failed to contemporaneously object to the prosecutor's improper comments.

Following his arrest, defendant made an inculpatory statement to investigators. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and rejected his contention that there was insufficient evidence that he had the requisite intent to commit murder alone or as a principal. The court found that defendant's intent to murder could be inferred from the facts. Defendant admitted to tying up the victim, engaging in sexual acts with him, and in driving him to the location where he was then shot. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the charge of aggravated rape, because the rape and the murder were part of a continuo transaction. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to support the charge of kidnapping because there was no evidence that defendant intended to release the victim in exchange for something of value. The court found that defendant's statement to the police was voluntary and that there was no evidence that he was coerced or beaten by the police. Defense counsel's decision to use a no question defense was a reasonable strategy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Twenty-fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), entered after a jury trial, that convicted him of violating La.

Ann. &sect; 14:30(3) by committing first degree murder with the specific intent to kill or to inflict great bodily harm on more than one person, rejected his manslaughter defense pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:31, and sentenced him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a 32-year-old recovering alcoholic with no criminal history, became intoxicated after discovering that the woman with whom he lived had been unfaithful to him. When she taunted him that she had never loved him, he stabbed her to death, wounded her previous lover, and attempted to kill himself. At trial, he relied on a manslaughter defense. The district court excluded the woman's taunt from evidence in both the guilt and punishment phases of the trial, ruling that it was hearsay. The court reversed the conviction and death sentence, holding that the district court had erroneously excluded crucial mitigating evidence. The taunt was not hearsay because it was offered to prove state of mind. It was relevant, mitigating evidence and its exclusion impeded the task of the sentencing jury and deprived defendant of a fair trial. The court determined that the death sentence imposed upon defendant was excessive pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.9 because it was disproportionate to the offense. The court noted that the second victim did not die and that defendant showed immediate remorse, circumstances not present in other death penalty cases reviewed by the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's attorney went to defendant's home and retrieved a gun that was later determined to be the murder weapon. The police confronted the attorney and he surrendered the weapon. The attorney then sought to exclude the weapon as well as his own testimony concerning the weapon or its subsequent discovery by authorities. The trial court refused to exclude the evidence and the court of appeal affirmed. The attorney sought further review and the court initially affirmed and remanded the case for a hearing concerning whether defendant and his attorney had conspired to secrete relevant evidence so that the crime or fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege was applicable. Defendant applied for a second rehearing, questioning the court's rulings and requesting a clarification of the procedure for proving the crime or fraud exception. Upon reconsideration, the court concluded that the importance of the attorney-client privilege justified the use of a motion to suppress to test the admissibility of such communications prior to trial. The court set aside the portion of the ruling denying defendant's motion to exclude the testimony of the attorney and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was discovered dead of a gunshot wound in her home. She had been raped and robbed. Defendant had been observed in the area. Scientific evidence discovered at the scene implicated defendant. After trial began, the State discovered defendant had confessed to his cellmate. Defendant's attorney informed the district court of a possible conflict of interest because he represented the cellmate. The district judge there was no conflict unless the attorney cross-examined the cellmate regarding bias or confidential matters. Out of the presence of the jury, the attorney established that the cellmate had not received a reduced sentence for his testimony. The cellmate was not cross-examined regarding potential bias before the jury. Defendant was convicted and appealed. The court remanded for a determination of whether defendant received effective assistance of counsel. The district court affirmed and defendant appealed. The court applied the Cuyler test and held that there was no actual conflict of interest. Defendant was not prejudiced by the State's mid-trial notice of the cellmate's testimony because it was not dilatory in failing to discover the confession before trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges of prostitution and solicitation of a crime against nature were dismissed as violative of U.S. Const. amend. I. On review, the court reversed because the alleged impermissible application in the case was so unlikely and because it would affect conduct rather than speech, the court concluded that the statutes were not overbroad and that if any overbreadth did exist it should be cured through case-by-case analysis of the fact situations to which their sanctions, assertedly, might not be applied. The court reasoned that previously the crime against nature definition had been upheld as constitutional, and that in reviewing the crime of solicitation it was not overboard nor vague in its prescribed conduct. The court held that the words of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:82(b) put persons on notice that the solicitation to perform an indiscriminate act of sexual intercourse for compensation was a violation of criminal law. The court reasoned that speech was not an unlimited, unqualified right, but must, on occasion, be subordinated to other considerations of enforcing the law and prescribing criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff widow sued defendants, sheriff and State of Louisiana, and alleged that her husband's death occurred in the scope of his employment as a deputy. The sheriff and the State argued that the widow could not obtain relief because La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1034 B provided no workers' compensation coverage of its own. The Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of Rapides declared that statute unconstitutional. The sheriff and the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Louisiana's workers' compensation coverage scheme, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1021 et seq., excluded sheriff's deputies as a class from coverage under the act. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1034 B had one exception to the general exclusion of sheriff's deputies, Orleans Parish sheriff's deputies were included in the state workers' compensation coverage scheme. The state supreme court was presented with the question of whether or not the Louisiana Constitution's guarantee of equal protection of the law was violated by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1034 B. The state supreme court found that workers' compensation legislation were laws which served economic and social welfare interests of the state. The act's coverage of Orleans Parish criminal sheriff's deputies was rational, and recognized the differences in functions and funding between that office and other sheriff's offices. The legislative scheme furthered the appropriate state interest of providing a workers' compensation coverage which was not drained by a class with heavy demands upon the state's funds for such coverage. Thus, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1034 B was not a violation of equal protection under the Louisiana Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The statute was reasonably and substantially related to the State's purpose, and thus, was not overly broad. La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city sued defendant chemical company for back taxes. The Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge, State of Louisiana held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1512 and certain parish sales tax ordinances, which mandated payment by the losing taxpayer of attorney fees of 10 percent of the taxes, interest, and penalties determined to be due, was unconstitutional. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the mandatory attorney fee provision abrogated the Louisiana Supreme Court's exclusive jurisdiction as conferred by the State constitution to regulate the practice of law. In the instant case, that portion of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1512 and its counterpart in the parish sales tax ordinances attempted to regulate attorney fees. The prohibition against a lawyer accepting a &quot;clearly excessive fee&quot; could not be abrogated by a law fixing the amount of attorney fees as a percentage of the amount to be collected. Despite such a law, the courts could inquire into the reasonableness of such a fee. The provisions at issue did not per se conflict with the Louisiana Supreme Court's exclusive constitutional authority to regulate the practice of law in the State. Therefore, these provisions were not unconstitutional. Rather, they were subject to judicial scrutiny on a case by case basis regarding whether the attorney fees as mandated by law were reasonable and not excessive under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The temporary restraining order was granted. The district court held that the new law was unconstitutional and granted the injunction prohibiting the qualification of candidates and the elections. The intervenors appealed directly to the court pursuant to La. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(D)(1). The court held that the trial court erred because the new law was constitutional and an injunction should not have been granted. The court determined that the new law changed an existing justice of the peace district and court by dividing it into two separate districts and courts.

In order to determine whether &sect; 40:1785 was overbroad, the court considered whether defendants had a constitutionally protected right to possess unregistered sawed-off shotguns. The court concluded it was reasonable for the state legislature, in the interest of public welfare and safety, to require the registration of weapons whose customary use in times of peace was in the perpetration of crime. Contrary to defendants' contention, the court noted that &sect; 40:1785 specifically provided that no information in the application for registration of the gun could be used as evidence in a prosecution for the earlier possession of unregistered firearms.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the Sewerage and Water Board of New Orleans, sought a writ of review to a judgment from the Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which reversed a district court's order granting the Board an injunction restraining defendant, the City Civil Service Commission for the City of New Orleans, from grouping the Board's employees with the employees of intervenor, the City of New Orleans, for layoff purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In order to ease the city's fiscal crisis, the Commission, pursuant to Civil Service Commission for the City of New Orleans, La., Rule XII, grouped together all classified employees in every agency, board, and department, and made a system-wide layoff and transfer of the employees among the various entities. The Board sued the Commission for a judgment declaring that the Board and the city were distinct entities and for an injunction restraining the Commission from grouping the Board's employees with the city's employees. The district court granted the Board's motion for summary judgment, but the appellate court reversed. On a writ of review, the court affirmed the appellate court's judgment. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:4076 designated all of but a few of the Board's employees as members of the civil service subject to the Commission's rules. La. Const. art. X, &sect; 4(A) (1974) established the Commission, and La. Const. art. X, &sect; 10(A)(1) (1974) gave the Commission rule making power.

The court affirmed the prior dismissal of the lawsuit, finding that the statute did not violate due process, equal protection or open access to courts under either the state or federal constitutions. The statute affected all people who underwent treatment alike, and it was not unconstitutional for the legislative to impose time limits on the right to bring suit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The president of a company also served on the board of supervisors for a state university. The president's company entered into a series of contracts with the state university. The contracts were awarded after receipt of sealed competitive bids.

The Commission ordered the discontinuation of the existing contracts between the parties and mandated that the university refrain from entering into future contracts with members of its governing authority. The court of appeal reversed the Commission's decision and held that the transactions were allowed because the contracts were awarded by sealed competitive bid. The court held that the court of appeal's judgment was in error because the legislature had decided that board members should not do business with the agency governed by the board.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient commenced a dental malpractice claim against the dentist. The patient sought to introduce testimony from a periodontist relative to the standard of care applicable to general dentists practicing in the parish. The trial court excluded the testimony. The appellate court found that the trial court erred but that the error did not warrant a reversal. The patient sought certiorari. The court held that the periodontist was qualified to testify as to the standard of care expected of general dentists practicing in the parish. Given the periodontist's credentials, his extensive treatment of the patient subsequent to the treatment rendered by the dentist, and the substance of the proffered testimony, the exclusion of the proffered testimony was extremely prejudicial to the patient's case. While the jury could have rendered a verdict in favor of the dentist had it been allowed to hear the proffered testimony, the court could not state with any degree of certainty that the jury would have rendered such a verdict had it been allowed to hear that testimony.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a judgment from the Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of Rapides (Louisiana), finding La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with public gambling in violation of &sect; 14:90.2. Defendant filed a motion to quash the bill of information on the grounds that the statute was unconstitutional. The district court granted the motion. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that statutes were presumed to be valid and the constitutionality of a statute should be upheld whenever possible. Because a state statute was presumed constitutional, the party challenging the statute bore the burden of proving its unconstitutionality. The attack would fail if there existed a reasonable relationship between the law and the promotion or protection of a public good, such as health, safety, or welfare. The court noted that the suppression or regulation of gambling was a legitimate state interest. Second, the court held that the definition of public was sufficient and had a generally accepted meaning to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what conduct was forbidden. Lastly, the court concluded that even if the bill of information did not fully inform defendant of the allegations, a dismissal was not warranted. A bill of particulars could cure any defect in the bill.</SPAN></P>

The Board asserted that the Act was unconstitutional because it took property from the district without compensation and impaired the obligation of contracts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act provided for the return of property which had been taken for the construction of the Bohemia Spillway, which was designed to divert water from the Mississippi River and prevent flooding in the City of New Orleans. Because of other flood control projects, the legislature found that the spillway was no longer necessary and ordered the return of the property which had been taken for its construction to it original owners pursuant to La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 14(B). The court found that no constitutional provision prevented the legislature from declaring that the Levee District's property was no longer publicly useful and from ordering its return. The court held that La. Const. art. I, &sect; 4, which protected the ownership and enjoyment of private property, did not apply to public property held by a state agency. Intervenors who held bonds issued by the Levee District claimed that the Act unconstitutionally impaired the obligation of contracts pursuant to La. Const. art. I, &sect; 23 and U.S. Const. art.

The cable television operators alleged that the Commission lacked jurisdiction to regulate the rates of pole attachment agreements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cable television operators entered into contracts with the utility companies to allow attachment to utility poles for services. The Commission established a formula for calculating the pole attachment rates. The rates were higher than the Federal Communications Commission's rates. The cable television operators filed suit alleging that the Commission lacked jurisdiction over the pole attachment agreements. The district court entered judgment in the Commission's favor. The court appeals reversed. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that when a company used facilities that were essential to the services provided by a utility, the Commission, under its authority to regulate the rates charged by utilities to their customers for the services that they provide, must ensure that the amount charged for the essential facilities was fair. The court concluded that the Commission had the authority to regulate the rates, terms, and conditions of pole attachment agreements of Commission-regulated public utilities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's indictment contained information about his two prior theft convictions. He contended that his due process rights were violated when the indictment was read to jurors without a limiting instruction that they could consider his prior convictions only for sentencing enhancement purposes. The court upheld the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:67, which called for jurors to be informed of defendant's prior convictions through the reading of the indictment and through introduction of evidence of past convictions. The court held that when &sect; 14:67 was read in pari materia with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 802, the third offense theft procedure did not deny due process because art. 802 required that a limiting instruction be given to the jury as to the prior crime evidence. The court concluded, however, that defendant's due process rights were violated because jurors were given evidence of his prior convictions during the guilt-determination phase of trial and because they were not instructed to refrain from taking the information into account in deciding guilt or innocence. Thus, an unconstitutional and substantial potential for prejudice was presented.</SPAN></P>

State Bd. of Nursing R. 3.041 (Rule), defendant Louisiana State Board of Nursing (Board) challenged a judgment from the Court of Appeal, First Circuit (Louisiana), affirming the judgment overruling the Board's exception of prescription and remanding for a trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The medical society brought suit alleging that the Rule which created the position of Primary Nurse Associate constituted the practice of medicine. The Board filed exceptions of prescription, which were overruled, by the trial court. The court of appeal affirmed and remanded for a trial. On appeal to the supreme court, the court affirmed and remanded. The court held that the medical society's suit alleged that the Rule was unconstitutional and exceeded the statutory authority of the Board. Thus, the medical society's suit was not governed by the 30-day period found in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:964. Rather, the suit was governed by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:963, which &sect; 49:963 required that the medical society request agency review. The section also required a showing that the review in a contested adjudicated case would not provide an adequate remedy and would inflict irreparable injury. The Medical Society alleged that a contested adjudicated case would not provide an adequate remedy and that the Rule inflicted irreparable injury on the society.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city sought review from the Shreveport City Court, Parish of Caddo (Louisiana), which granted a motion by defendant, a journeyman plumber, to quash an affidavit that charged him with violating Shreveport, La., Comprehensive Building Code &sect;&sect; 102.1, 110.1 and 117.1 by performing plumbing work without a license at a specified time and place. The city court held that the ordinance that adopted the code provisions was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating the city building code by performing plumbing work without a license. The code at issue prohibited defendant from engaging in the business of plumbing unless he was licensed by the city as a master plumber or was employed by an entity that had a member who was so licensed. Defendant filed a motion to quash, asserting that the ordinance conflicted with state law with respect to the type of work a journeyman plumber could do and, therefore, it constituted an effort by the City to regulate a field preempted by state law. The motion further asserted that the ordinance was not a legitimate exercise of the city's police power. The trial court granted defendant's motion to quash, and the city appealed. On review, the court found that there was no reasonable exercise of the city's police power and there was no reason related to the public health for the prohibition imposed in the instant case. The court narrowed the issue and held that the city could not enforce its law against defendant or any other licensed journeyman plumber who engaged in the plumbing business to the extent of repairing a leaking lavatory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with issuing a worthless check to a department store. He filed a motion to quash, alleging that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:71(A)(2) established an unconstitutional presumption. The trial court declared the presumption unconstitutional, but held the remainder of the statute to be severable, and denied the motion to quash. The State appealed from the declaration of unconstitutionality. The court held that the statute created only a permissive presumption, the validity of which had to be tested, not in the abstract, but in connection with all the evidence in a particular case. The court decreed that a jury should be told that it could, but need not, find that defendant possessed the intent to defraud based upon the basic facts set out in the statute. Thus, the court declared that the statute was constitutional on its face and that defendant had to test the validity of the presumption as it applied to him at trial.</SPAN></P>

The issue on appeal was the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1231 (1980).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deceased suffered a fatal heart attack in the course of his work for the employer. The deceased left no dependents. After the death of the deceased, the deceased's mother died. The deceased and his mother were survived by plaintiffs. Plaintiffs brought a suit for worker's compensation death benefits. The trial court concluded that there was no rational basis for giving nondependent parents a lump sum award while requiring other statutory beneficiaries to prove dependency and rendered judgment in favor of defendants. Plaintiffs appealed to the appellate court, and the appeal was transferred to the court. The court held that the parental benefit provisions of La. Rev. Stat. tit. 23, &sect; 1231(1) (1950, amended 1980) were constitutional and proper under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1251. The court found that defendants were liable for attorney's fees and penalties under &sect;&sect; 23:1201B, E and 23:1201.2, where defendants were clearly liable for a sum on plaintiffs' underlying action and failure to pay that sum was arbitrary, capricious, and without probable cause.</SPAN></P>

The court found that because the local bidder was a resident and the next lowest bidder, it was entitled to the contract. On appeal to the supreme court, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the public bid law was intended to apply to &quot;public works,&quot; that was contracts for building and physical improvements, and not to public service contracts. The contract in question was a service contract and not a contract for a public work. The court held that the public bid law applied to the contract only because La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a former patient, sought review of a judgment from the Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which affirmed the trial court's decision sustaining defendant doctor's plea of prescription. The issue on appeal involved La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628's three-year limitation for bringing a medical malpractice action when the act did not cause injury until more than three years after it occurred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor surgically implanted a rod in the patient's back to correct a lateral curvature of her spine. Five years later, the patient returned to the hospital complaining of severe back pain. X-rays revealed that the rod had broken. The court reversed the judgments of the lower courts and overruled the doctor's plea of prescription. The court concluded that since injury is an essential element of a cause of action for damages for injury and the courts cannot take cognizance of such an action until an injury occurs, commencement of the accrual of prescription was suspended between the time of the act or omission and the time the injury occurs, and that &sect; 9:5628, being a prescriptive rather than a peremptive statute, did not prevent the suspension of prescription during that period of time. The court based its decision on their interpretation of the statute. The court held that when injury did not immediately follow the act or omission, the statute did not prevent the suspension of prescription during the period between the date of the act or omission and the date that injury first resulted from the act or omission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments from the lower courts were reversed, the exception of prescription was overruled, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State alleged that defendants neglected and/or mistreated certain patients by failing to assure that a nursing home was maintained in a good and sanitary manner, that necessary health services were performed, that the staff was properly trained, that there were adequate medical supplies and sufficient staff, that patients' records were correctly maintained, and that patients were adequately fed, watered and cared for. The court noted that &sect; 14:93.3 proscribed not mere neglect, but &quot;criminally negligent mistreatment or neglect.&quot; The court opined that all nursing homes and other licensed facilities caring for the infirm received written notification of Louisiana's laws, minimum standards, rules, regulations, and orders with which they were expected to comply. Thus, there was notice of the duties imposed in regard to residents. Because defendants were fully apprised of their affirmative duties toward residents, there was no problem with the due process requirement of notice. The court held that &sect; 14:93.3 gave fair notice of the conduct that it prohibited and was sufficiently clear in meaning to afford a person of ordinary understanding fair notice of the proscribed conduct.</SPAN></P>

The jury found that the offense was committed in an especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel manner and that defendant was engaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of an aggravated rape and aggravated kidnapping.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessees rented a building and land upon which they operated a restaurant. The state initiated expropriation proceedings against the lessors. When an analysis revealed that the restaurant would no longer be a viable business enterprise after the expropriation, the lessees filed a petition to intervene in the action. Their lease was not recorded. The state filed an exception of no right of action against the lessees, on the ground that the public records doctrine, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2754-2756, entitled the state to rely on the absence of a recorded lease. The trial court sustained the exception and denied the lessees' petition to intervene. The lessees sought certiorari review. The court held that La. Const. art. I, &sect; 4 gave the lessees a property interest in their lease, despite their having failed to record it. The court held that the leasehold interest represented a common property interest that was not defeated by failure to record, and that the public records doctrine had no effect, other than to permit the state to name as defendants only those whose interest was recorded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A corporation appealed a trial court judgment permanently enjoining it from the operation of community homes housing six unrelated persons in areas of the city zoned for single family residences. The court of appeal affirmed, rejecting the corporation's argument that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28:381(8)'s characterization of a community home with six or fewer mentally retarded persons as a single family unit superceded the definition of single family dwelling in the City's zoning ordinance. The corporation sought further review. The court affirmed the judgments of the lower courts because it found that &sect; 28:381(8) was not an expression of a legislative intent to override a local ordinance adopted in non-discriminatory terms at an unsuspicious time. The court noted that the corporation had the right to operate the homes in multiple family residential districts but not in single family residential districts in the absence of express legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner-trainer was suspended for violating La. Admin. Code tit. 35, &sect; 1743 (1984) after a search of his stable turned up unauthorized drugs. The court originally held that by accepting his license the owner-trainer consented to all searches authorized by the commission or alternatively that, even if illegally obtained, evidence was admissible because the exclusionary rule did not apply in civil administrative proceedings. On reconsideration the court found that the owner-trainer did not consent to the search of his stable, that the warrantless search violated his Fourth Amendment rights, and that the evidence was obtained illegally. To determine the appropriateness of extending the exclusionary rule to a civil proceeding before the racing commission the court weighed the likely social benefits of excluding unlawfully seized evidence against the likely social costs. The court found that high social costs would likely result from exclusion of the challenged evidence that outweighed the additional deterrent value of applying the exclusionary rule that would likely be small and held that the exclusionary rule did not apply in civil proceedings before the racing commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reinstated its judgment on original hearing in the action of a racehorse owner-trainer suspended for violation of the rules of racing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his convictions for armed robbery and second degree murder. The State did not appeal and did not seek any review or modification of the sentence. The court of appeal affirmed defendant's conviction, but vacated the sentence for armed robbery because the trial court did not mention any limitation on parole eligibility as was required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64. The court of appeal concluded that under the 1984 amendment to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 882, it had the duty to correct patent sentencing errors on appeal. The court granted certiorari and reversed. The court rejected the conclusion that the appellate court had the duty to correct every illegal sentence that it discovered. The court determined that the amendment did not permit the appellate court to correct an illegally lenient sentence where the prosecutor had not complained. The court found that the correction of a patent error that was favorable to the only appellant was contrary to the basic precepts of appellate practice. The court reasoned that where defendant was the only party to have filed an appeal, the filing of the appeal should not have operated to his detriment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a department of natural resources, appealed from a decision of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which declared Act 233 of the 1984 Legislature unconstitutional in plaintiff's, a levee board, action to enjoin enforcement of the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By Act 233 of 1984 (Act) the legislature implemented La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 14(B) and sought to return certain land to its former owners or their successors from whom the property was acquired by expropriation or by purchase under threat of expropriation. The court held that the Act was constitutional. La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 14(B)(4), which allowed the return of expropriated lands, overrode all other prior constitutional provisions which could have been in conflict with it. The Act did not impair the security of general obligation bonds in violation of La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 38(B) because the Act had nothing to do with consolidating, dividing, reorganizing, or merging levee districts. Act 233 comported with La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 14(B) by declaring the cessation of public and necessary purpose, ordering a return of the property to the former owners or their successors, and by the inclusion of such terms and conditions as specified by the legislature. Although the levee board owned the land, its ownership was not absolute. The levee board was a state agency and any land granted to it by the state could be taken away.</SPAN></P>

Defendant went to a bar and then returned to the house after drinking and using cocaine. Defendant pulled out a gun and told the stepfather he was going to kill him and did so. Defendant then shot the mother five times. The court held that defendant's conviction and sentence were proper. The facts supported a conclusion that defendant contemplated and caused the death of one person and great bodily harm to another by a single, consecutive course of conduct, thus indicating the presence of an aggravating circumstance required for a death sentence. There was no error in relying on La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 798(2) to exclude potential jurors that were opposed to capital punishment. The trial court was not required to hold a hearing as to whether his wife was aware of her privilege not to testify against him. There was no error in admitting post-mortem photos of the stepfather, as they were not particularly gruesome. Defendant had adequate notice of the prosecutor's intention of bringing up defendant's past misconduct during the penalty phase and all evidence pertaining to defendant's convictions was admissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband was charged by information of criminal neglect of family. He filed a motion to quash the information on the ground that the state could not constitutionally use the presumption of paternity to convict him of the charged offense. The motion was denied, as well as a motion to require blood tests. In reversing the decision, the court held that the prosecutor attempted to broaden the criminal statute by characterizing the husband of the child's mother as a legal parent for all purposes. The term &quot;parent&quot; in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:74(2) encompassed only the persons who begot or brought forth the child and could not constitutionally be expanded by interpretation to include defendant, who was merely presumed in the civil law to be the biological parent. The contrary expansion of the term in State v. Manning, 390 So. 2d 494 (La. 1980), and State v. Kiper, 408 So. 2d 1312 (La. 1982) was incorrect, and those cases were overruled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged a decision from the Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Ouachita (Louisiana), which granted defendant's motion to quash an information charging him with possession of contraband and introduction of the same into or upon the grounds of a correctional institution. The State challenged the finding that portions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14: 402(A) (1977) were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of contraband when he was found with a large quantity of cigarettes. After an information was filed against him, defendant filed a motion to quash. The district court determined that the portion of &sect; 14:402(A) that defined &quot;contraband&quot; was unconstitutional because it vested arbitrary discretion in administrative officials to determine what &quot;contraband&quot; was. The State then sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the Louisiana Constitution required a separation of powers between the branches of government. The legislative branch was permitted to delegate certain authority to administrative boards and agencies. However, the legislative power to create and define criminal offenses was not subject to delegation. Under &sect; 14:402(A), administrative officials had the unbridled discretion to make exceptions to the legislature's proscription of items as contraband whenever they issued an article, sold it in the canteen, or otherwise regulated or authorized it. This unfettered authority contravened the mandate of La. Const. art. 2, &sect; 2. Therefore, the portion of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:402(A) defining &quot;contraband&quot; was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to manslaughter and driving while intoxicated. Defendant appealed his sentence, claiming it was excessive. The Court of Appeal, First Circuit, parish of St. Mary, found that the trial judge had imposed an illegally lenient sentence and imposed additional jail time based on two firearm enhancement statutes: former La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14:95.2. and La. Code Crim. Pro. art. 893.1 (repealed). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was not charged in the indictment with regard to the possession of a firearm in the commission of the manslaughter. Thus, the district attorney's failure to charge defendant barred the judge from enhancing the manslaughter penalty under the provisions of former La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.2. The additional two year penalty imposed by the Court of Appeal was therefore illegal. The sentence was arguably impermissibly excessive, at least in part because of the district attorney's failure to provide notice of his intent to invoke this enhancement provision. Notwithstanding that defendant no doubt knew of the use of a firearm in the commission of his felony, he was positively not alerted to the impending application of La. Code Crim. Pro. art. 893.1 (repealed) until sentencing. Because the judge did not discuss this prior to defendant entering his guilty plea, he was misinformed about his sentence exposure. The prejudice to defendant was clear. Defendant's assignments were therefore meritorious -- neither former La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14:95.2 nor La. Code Crim. Pro. art. 893.1 (repealed) were properly applied in sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the defendant's conviction but vacated his sentence and remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for committing manslaughter, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:31. He was tried by a 12 person jury which unanimously found him guilty as charged. At sentencing the trial judge was somewhat sympathetic with the defendant and expressed that he might otherwise impose a five year unsuspended parolable sentence. Nonetheless, he felt compelled by the existence of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.2 and La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893.1 to impose for this manslaughter offense a prison term totaling seven years without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. Five of those seven years were imposed under art. 893.1 and two of them under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.2. On review, the court concluded the sentence was illegal. In tandem application of &sect; 14:95.2 and La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893.1 was permitted. However, the sentencing court erred in its applying La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.2 without giving the defendant notice of the firearm arm use enhancement in the indictment.</SPAN></P>

In seeking writs first to the Court of Appeal, Second Circuit, Parish of Lincoln (Louisiana) and in the present action, defendant alleged two bases for relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant complained of (1) an illegal, excessive and unconstitutional sentence, in part because of the in tandem application of La.

Ann. art. 893.1, and (2) the trial court's overruling his motion to quash and/or plea of unconstitutionality, which protested application of art. 893.1, notwithstanding the absence of pre-trial or pre-plea notice. Section 14:95.2 and art. 893.1 were complimentary, not parallel. They could be imposed simultaneously when applicable. The sentence enhancement imposed under &sect; 14:95.2 was illegal because defendant was not charged in the bill of information with &sect; 14:95.2 or use of a firearm in the commission of second degree attempted murder. With regard to the art. 893.1 enhancement, since there was no constitutional deficiency in defendant's not being formally notified of the gun use, or the district attorney's or judge's forthcoming intention to invoke art. 893.1, and since defendant was not prejudiced by the absence of formal notification concerning art. 893.1, there was no impediment to the art. 893.1 enhancement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, after a jury trial, convicted defendant of three counts of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30 first degree murder and on two counts of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:31 manslaughter, and, after the jury's unanimous recommendation, sentenced him to death for each of the three first degree murder convictions. Defendant appealed. One issue involved defendant's withdrawal of his insanity plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant threatened to kill his former girlfriend, then bought a gun, got into her mother's and stepfather's home, and then shot and killed the girlfriend, her child, the child's father, and the girlfriend's mother and stepfather. Psychiatrist's agreed that defendant was paranoid in the extreme, but competent to proceed to trial. Defendant wanted to discharge his attorney, as he wanted him to continue to plead insanity. The supreme court found defendant clearly understood the consequences of his withdrawal of his insanity plea; defendant believed a jury would think he had actually killed the persons if he pled insanity, and the insanity plea was inconsistent with his alibi defense strategy. Defendant's attorney and the trial court had to acquiesce to defendant's desire to change his plea. The strength of the evidence, including a taxi driver's non-suggestive (applying the five Stovall factors) identification of defendant, overcame the alibi defense. The supreme court also held that, for fair cross-section jury selection purposes, people that had a common idea, a single attitude (that they would not impose the death penalty), did not comprise a cognizable, distinctive group.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Because a firearm was used in commission of the felony, the trial judge applied La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893.1 along with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:32 and sentenced defendant to serve five years at hard labor, unsuspended, and without benefit of parole or probation. On writ review, he raised three points of error concerning: (1) sufficiency of evidence; (2) the state's use of gruesome photographs; and (3) the constitutionality of La. Code Crim. Pro. art. 893.1. No error was found. First, the evidence showed undeniably that defendant deliberately pulled a loaded .38 caliber revolver, cocked it, and pointed it at another human being. Second, photographs of the victim's body were not gruesome; they were probative. Third, application of article 893.1 furthered the legislative purpose of restricting the abuse of firearms.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee horse owner sued appellant state racing commission, challenging the commission's three-year suspension of the owner from horse racing, and a monetary fine. The Court of Appeal, Fourth District, State of Louisiana, reversed the trial court's decision affirming the commission's rulings. The commission appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner was suspended after law enforcement officers found prohibited drugs in a horse stall being used by the owner. The owner claimed that the warrantless search of the stall was unconstitutional. The state supreme court held that the owner, as a participant in a closely regulated and licensed business, consented to certain restrictions on his privacy. Because horse racing was a strictly regulated activity, licenses to participate in the sport were only issued under certain terms and conditions. Among other things, a licensee must agree to being searched within the grounds of a racing association. This type of consent was valid, despite the element of coercion. Further, the owner had less expectation of privacy in the barn area, which was actually owned by the race track and merely assigned to him for temporary use, than he would have had in his own person or vehicle. Moreover, in civil administrative proceedings, relevant evidence which might be excluded in a criminal prosecution could be considered. Finally, since the state police racing investigations unit was an enforcement arm of the commission, its activities must have been regarded as authorized by the commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that an instruction read to the jury created a presumption of specific intent in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. While the instruction contained a prohibited conclusive presumption of intent, the court held that it did not lessen the state's burden of proving that defendant fired the gun intentionally. Defendant then contended that the trial court erred in the penalty phase of the trial by allowing evidence of an unrelated armed robbery for which defendant was charged but not convicted. The trial court erred in overruling defendant's objection to the evidence because defendant had no prior notice that the evidence would be offered. The error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. It was the only indication to the jury of any previous violent criminal behavior by defendant. It also formed the only basis for the prosecutor's argument to the jury that defendant, who had no prior felony convictions, should be sentenced to death because he committed the murder while on a robbery and murder spree.</SPAN></P>

The State appealed the decision of the Criminal District Court, Section C, parish of Orleans (Louisiana).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that solicitation was merely an attempted crime against nature and the elevation of an attempt to the same status as the completed offense (unnatural carnal copulation) violated the constitution. Secondly, she contended that the meaning of solicitation was unclear rendering La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:89(A)(2)&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague. The trial court ruled that the statute was unconstitutional. Defendant cited no authority to support her proposition that the elevation of solicitation to the same status as unnatural carnal copulation was unconstitutional. Using its broad police powers, the state legislature had the authority to enact legislation to protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens. Furthermore, it had the authority to enact any law which was not prohibited by the state or federal constitutions. The instant court also found that the term solicitation was not ambiguous. Since its meaning was fixed, definite, and discernible by ordinary men of reasonable intelligence, the use of the term in &sect; 14:89(A)(2) was not unconstitutionally vague. The trial court's determination that the statute was unconstitutional was error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient appealed a judgment that limited the damages, excluding medical expenses, she could recover for the negligence committed by defendant university board to the statutory maximum set forth in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.39. The court of appeal (Louisiana) affirmed holding that the limitation applied not only to the actual doctors and staff but also to the university board. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient claimed the university board was not protected by &sect; 40:1299.39. The university board's breach of its responsibilities constituted an independent act of negligence separate from that committed by its medical staff. Section 40:1299.39 placed a ceiling on the state's liability for malpractice, other than medical expenses, committed by a natural person who acted in a professional medical capacity. The court concluded that it did not protect entities like the university board because of the legislative history of the statute, and by comparison to the broad protections provided under the private Medical Malpractice Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.41 et seq., that included corporations, facilities, or institutions that provided health care. The three-level system of scrutiny did not apply to an analysis of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 (1974), the Declaration of Right to Individual Dignity. The court held that on remand the university board was required to prove that the placement of the patient in a statutory classification, based on her physical condition, that limited her recovery substantially furthered a legitimate state purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conclusion that the statutory maximum applied to the malpractice committed by individual health care providers, and to the university board but only under the theory of vicarious liability. The court vacated the determination that the statutory maximum applied to the university board's own acts of negligence. The court remanded this issue and other to the court of appeal for findings of fact and a judgment on the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By writ of certiorari, defendant appealed an order of the Court of Appeal, First Circuit Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), that dismissed his appeal of his conviction of aggravated rape and aggravated burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Certiorari was granted to determine the appropriate procedure for applications for out-of-time or delayed appeals. The state's highest appellate court held that a defendant who failed to appeal timely had to seek reinstatement of his right to appeal in the trial court in which the conviction was obtained. The trial court was in the best position to determine whether an applicant was entitled to relief. The procedural vehicle to exercise a right to appeal, after the delay provided in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 914 expired, was an application for post-conviction relief pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 924 to 930.7. Any contrary holding in State v. Braxton, 428 So. 2d 1153 (La. App. 3d Cir. 1983), was overruled. While La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 930.3 did not expressly provide for the specific form of relief to be used when a defendant had lost his constitutional right to appeal without fault on his part, the trial court arguably had the inherent authority to grant the relief of an out-of-time appeal. Defendant's motion for an out-of-time appeal in the trial court should have been treated as an application for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion for an out-of-time appeal was remanded to the trial court to be considered as an application for post-conviction relief, after defendant was afforded an opportunity to amend his application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed, by writ of certiorari, from the affirmance by the Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit Parish of Orleans, Louisiana, of his convictions of attempted forgery as a principal in the false endorsement of a check and of attempted forgery as a principal in the attempted transfer of the forged check, adjudication as a multiple (second) offender, and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question presented was whether the criminal definition of forgery under La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14:72 constituted two crimes for one transaction. Defendant argued that his two separate convictions and sentences violated the constitutional ban of double jeopardy. The State's highest appellate court held that the purpose of the statute was to provide a prosecutor with two avenues by which to prosecute one who dealt with forged instruments, not to authorize two cumulative punishments for the defendant who consummated the fabrication and transfer of a single writing. Defendant's conduct involved a single transaction including two &quot;units&quot; of proscribed conduct under a single section of the criminal code having a single penalty provision. The State's highest appellate court held that, when the legislature made a crime of either false uttering or false making and altering, it intended the maximum punishment for a completed transaction of forgery and uttering to be 10 years, and that, if the culprit fell short of accomplishing his purpose, or only perpetrated a designated part of the fraudulent operation, he still would have a maximum punishment of 10 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction and sentence for attempted forgery was affirmed. The conviction and sentence for the second count of attempted forgery were vacated. Otherwise, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff assessor appealed a tax commission decision that ruled in favor of defendant public power authority. The Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of Rapides (Louisiana), held that La. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 33:4545.3, 33:4172, were unconstitutional and that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:4545.24 contravened La. Const. art. III, &sect; 12(5). The public power authority appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The assessor had placed the property that was owned by the public power authorities, and on which the power plants were located, on the tax rolls and assessed an ad valorem tax. The tax commission held that the subject property was public property, used for public purposes, and exempt from ad valorem property tax under La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 21(A). The district court reversed the decision of the tax commission and held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 33:4545.2, 33:4172, each of which labeled power authorities as political subdivisions were unconstitutional as they conflicted with La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 44. As such, their ownership interest in the power plants was not public property, and was therefore subject to an ad valorem tax. The instant court reversed and held that the public power authorities were political subdivisions of the state, constitutionally created by statute, and that their respective ownership interests a power plant constituted public property used for public purposes, that was exempt from ad valorem taxation by virtue of La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 21(A). Thus, the trial court's ruling that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 33:4545.2, 33:4172, were unconstitutional was reversed.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, the city challenged the determination that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5105 (West 1985) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several minors purchased beer from two convenience stores. They were stopped by police, but were instructed to go home immediately. Later, they were involved in a fatal car accident. Appellees then filed an action against the city and several other parties. The city filed a motion to strike a demand for a jury trial. After the trial court determined that &sect; 13:5105 was unconstitutional, the city sought review. In reversing, the court determined that &sect; 13:5105 did not violate the Seventh Amendment because it did not apply to the states. It was not so fundamental to the American system of justice as to be required in the state courts under the Fourteenth Amendment. Moreover, &sect; 13:5105 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The state's classification of parties injured by governmental tortfeasors did not fall under a suspect or quasi-suspect category, which would have required heightened review. Additionally, the state had a legitimate interest in preserving its financial resources in minimizing the delays and greater court costs associated with jury trials. Therefore, &sect; 13:5105 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

A local newspaper intervened in the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A local politician was the District Attorney for the Parish for decades. At the same time he held numerous positions that affected the granting of mineral rights in the Parish. He also allegedly owned a private company that held and exploited mineral rights. His sons held similar positions. The council filed an action against the politician's extended family to recover revenue and mineral interests improperly taken from the Parish. The family sought a protective order to prohibit public disclosure of information produced by it. Eventually, the trial court ruled that documents could be designated &quot;confidential&quot; on an individual basis and ruled that the protective order did not apply to those who had been public officials or to their immediate families. The appellate court expanded the protective order to include all defendants and all designated materials. The Louisiana Supreme Court ruled that the right of the public to public information, especially that pertaining to public officials, outweighed the privacy interests supposedly protected by the expanded, blanket protective order. The court ruled that it was error under the statute to assign costs to the council.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raped and killed an 11-year-old girl and was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, the court affirmed and held as follows: Neither La. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 nor the U.S Constitution specified the number of peremptory challenges required in a trial. Thus, the 1983 amendments to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 799 reducing the number of peremptory challenges from 12 to eight was constitutional. The trial court properly excluded jurors who opposed the death penalty. Although defendant did not testify, the trial court properly admitted both of defendant's statements to the police to show that they were inconsistent. Under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 807, the trial court was not required to give defendant's requested jury charges, because the request were either not wholly correct, or because the requests were otherwise covered by the trial court's charges.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city showed that there was a problem with itinerant vendors selling from their trucks on city streets. Some trucks and vendors were from outside the city or the state. The current court found that the city had legitimate reasons for wishing to regulate itinerant vendors. It was within the city's legitimate exercise of authority to conduct health inspections in order to protect the health of its citizens. The city also had the right to protect property and aesthetic values. Itinerant vendors were required, in City of Lake Charles, La., Mun. Code &sect; 12-60(C), to move to a new site every two days. This prevented permanent location at one site. However it did not prevent a group of vendors from rotating sites. Thus, the current court found that this provision did not reasonably achieve the city's purpose. The specification of a distance of 1,000 feet between locations was chosen arbitrarily, and the court found that the city failed to point out any rational basis for the 1,000 foot distance. At oral argument in the current court, the vendor's counsel withdrew his objection to &sect; 12-60(F)(1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of heroin with intent to distribute and sentenced to mandatory life imprisonment without benefit of parole, but defendant asserted that evidence should have been suppressed and that his sentence was disproportionate to his offense. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence entered in Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans, Louisiana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that evidence from a jacket was obtained by means of an unconstitutional search and that life imprisonment without parole was unconstitutionally disproportionate to his non-violent crime. The Louisiana Supreme Court first held that, since defendant failed to move to suppress the challenged evidence before or during trial, defendant waived his right to challenge the constitutionality of the search and seizure. Further, the mandatory life sentence was not disproportionate to defendant's insidious offense involving the serious drug of heroin, particularly since defendant did not have the excuse of addiction. Although not necessarily violent, where the effect upon society of drug traffic is pernicious and far-reaching, distribution of heroin was surely as grave as a violent offense. However, the law in effect at the time defendant committed the offense authorized only a mandatory life sentence and did not permit the sentence to include the preclusion of parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence was amended to eliminate the preclusion of parole and, with such amendment, defendant's conviction and sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed that grant and remanded the action, finding that the classification of offenders that &sect; 14:106(A)(1) established was reasonable and that the statutory range of penalties reasonably aligned with the offender classification. The court reasoned that eliminating publicly displayed hard core sexual conduct was a legitimate State purpose and that classifying persons who committed such acts of obscenity as offenders that were deserving of punishment reasonably related to that purpose. The court also held that including violators who exposed themselves gratuitously with those who exposed themselves for commercial gain within the offender class did offend equal protection guarantees because the State's interest in curbing both types of activity was sufficiently strong and its means of doing so was rational. The court further found that the classification that &sect; 14:106(A)(1) created was not arbitrary, that it did not impinge on fundamental rights, and that it did not establish a suspect class.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder. Upon the court's instruction, the jury found that one aggravating circumstances had been established, and relying on that finding, recommended that defendant be sentenced to death. On appeal of the sentence, the court held that the death penalty statute was unconstitutional. The court subsequently considered the issue of whether remanding the case for a subsequent resentencing hearing would violate the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. Specifically, the issue arose as to whether, on remand, the jury could consider any additional aggravating circumstances in determining defendant's sentence at the resentencing hearing. The court ruled that the jury could do so. The court held that the fact the jury had previously found a single aggravating circumstance did not amount to an acquittal of the other aggravating circumstances argued or presented to the jury. The court further ruled that the jury's subsequent consideration of additional aggravating circumstances did not trigger application of double jeopardy principles.</SPAN></P>

The trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 215.1, 213(3) because the deputy had probable cause the stop defendant, as he had received a call alerting him to a suspected homicide, witnesses informed the deputy that two black males fled the scene, approximately 30 minutes after the call was issued, the deputy found defendant, a black male, hitchhiking near the scene with fresh blood on his suit. Further, defendant acknowledged comprehension of his Miranda rights. Although the victim's death was not cruel, heinous, and atrocious, the court affirmed defendant's death sentence because there was one aggravating circumstance to support the verdict and the two failing aggravating circumstances did not inject any arbitrary factors into the proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeal concluded that LARC's failure to obtain local governing authority approval of the site for a community home, as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28:478(C), resulted in a violation of building restrictions. The court reversed the judgments of the lower courts and dismissed the property owners' petition with prejudice. Because LARC's community home for mentally retarded persons was a residential purpose, the court held that the trial court erred in finding that LARC's proposed use of the property violated the restrictive covenant. The court further held that &sect; 28:478(C) was constitutionally infirm because it violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court concluded that heightened scrutiny was appropriate for the quasi-suspect class of retarded citizens.

The court agreed with the trial court that the State's notice of intent, filed within three days of defendant's requests for discovery, provided adequate notice to defendant of the State's evidence. Defendant declined the trial court's suggestion of a continuance. Further, defendant did not allege that he was prejudiced, and there was nothing to be learned from the disputed items. While the trial court erred in denying defendant's charge, under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 807, it was not reversible error because defendant covered the responsive verdicts in closing arguments. Although it was not appropriate for the State to introduce evidence in its opening statement, the error was harmless. Further, while some closing remarks of the prosecutor were inappropriate, they did not prejudice defendant. Finally, the evidence supported a finding that the offense occurred during an armed robbery, and the sentence was not disproportionate to the penalty imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughter alleged that she was the illegitimate child of the decedent and sought to be declared the administratrix of his estate. The wife filed a rule against the daughter to show cause why she should not be barred by the time limitations of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 209. The trial court found that art. 209 was unconstitutional and dismissed the wife's rule. The wife sought certiorari. The court held that art. 209 did not inevitably exclude significant categories of illegitimate children from intestate paternal inheritance because it allowed intestate paternal inheritance if proceedings to establish filiation were instituted within 19 years from birth or should the alleged father die within that time, then within one year of his death. The limitation was substantially related to permissible state interests because the result in paternity suits frequently turned upon sketchy, conflicting testimony from only two witnesses. It was certainly conceivable that evidence essential to paternity suits would be lost in 19 years and it was evident that the passage of 19 years will appreciably increase the likelihood of fraudulent claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff State of Louisiana directly appealed a judgment of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, which, in three consolidated cases, decreed the Sunday Closing Act (Act), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:191 et seq., unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's judgment was based on the premise that the constitutionality of the Act as a proper exercise of the State's police power under the Fourteenth Amendment was no longer justified given the purpose of the Act and the means by which the purposes were carried out. On appeal, the court noted that the Act's stated purpose was to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Louisiana and to inhibit unfair competition among the businesses in the community. The Act purported to do nothing other than to provide a day of rest for the state population employed in places of public business. The district court's conclusion that the Act's purpose of preventing unfair competition was thwarted by statutory exemptions and actually promoted unfair competition had no merit. Despite the district court's conclusion that the Act constituted a denial of equal protection due to selective enforcement, the court quoted the United States Supreme Court's statement that the conscious exercise of some selectivity in enforcement was not in itself a federal constitutional violation. Finally, the court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:194 was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator sought review of the judgments of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal and the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which, on a previous remand, denied habeas corpus relief. The court consolidated the case with respondent sheriff's motion for rehearing of the court's previous remand order, which required him to grant relator work credit and consider good behavior credit to reduce relator's sentence in the parish prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator petitioned to compel reduction of his parish prison sentence for felony theft by credits for his work and for his good behavior. In previous appellate proceedings, the court ordered the district court to grant mandatory work credit under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:571.10(A) and ordered the sheriff to exercise his discretion regarding the grant of good time credit under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:571.10(B). Relator appealed from the district court's findings that he was not entitled to good time credit and that no work credit had been earned, which the court consolidated with the sheriff's pending motion for rehearing on the remand order. Relator argued that the statute required the grant of work and good time credits, while the sheriff argued that credits were discretionary. In reversing in part, the court ruled that, although &sect; 15:571.10(A) referred to inmate work under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:709, the reference was actually to parish public work under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:708, which was inadvertently renumbered when the acts were codified. The court ruled that work credit was mandatory but that good time credit was within the sheriff's discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the district court, affirmed the court's previous order requiring mandatory work credit, but reversed the previous order regarding the sheriff's discretionary grant of credit for good behavior.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff curator, on writ of review, challenged an order of the Court of Appeal, First Circuit, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which affirmed a judgment of the trial court and found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.39 et seq., applied to defendant Board of Supervisors of Louisiana State University and Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College, and that the limits of liability in the statute were constitutional. Liability was not at issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The curator sought damages for a person who suffered severe brain damage from a cardio-pulmonary arrest while a patient at the Board's facilities. The curator attacked the application and the constitutionality of the medical malpractice statute's limits on damages. The court found that the title of Part XXI-A, which prefaced &sect; 40:1299.39, related to liability for state services. Thus, the statute was not designedly applicable only to the health care providers listed in the definition of &quot;persons&quot; at &sect; 40:1299.39(a), but to all liability arising out of state services, including the State of Louisiana and its agencies. Further, the Board was an agency of the state. The court applied a rational basis analysis to the statute and found that it did not unconstitutionally violate either the equal protection or due process clauses of the state or federal constitutions, or La. Const. of 1974 art. I, &sect; 22, because a limitation of liability on medical malpractice claims was reasonably related to the State's attempt to minimize its costs and to maintain its medical services for the citizens of Louisiana at low or no cost.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with obscenity, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106, based on their practice of providing &quot;adult&quot; movies. Defendants moved to quash the bill of information, arguing that the depiction of videos on a television in a motel room had not meet the statutory &quot;public portrayal&quot; requirement. The Criminal District Court for the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) ruled the requirement not met and granted the motion. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that whether or not the rooms in the inn were public or private was irrelevant. Defendants were charged with exhibition and display of obscene material, a crime. Penal statutes must have been strictly construed against the state. Nevertheless, they must have been given a genuine construction, according to the fair import of their words in connection with the context, and with reference to the purpose of the provision, as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:3. Applying this rule of construction, the court found it clear that the purpose of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;14:106(A)(3) was to prohibit the distribution of tangible works depicting or describing the sexual acts described in &sect; 106(A)(2)(a)(b)(c)(d)(e). Consistent with the long history of attempted prohibition against the distribution of obscene material in Louisiana, the court found no convincing argument or evidence that only the sale of films and magazines for &quot;public portrayal&quot; was illegal. As there was no public portrayal requirement for a violation of &sect; 106(A)(3), the grant of defendants' motion to quash, based on its determination that a public portrayal of the tape was not demonstrated, was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's grant of defendants' motion to quash was reversed. The case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sewage plant owner/manufacturer was charged criminally with violating provisions of the Sanitary Code for installing sewer systems without a permit. He then filed a suit for declaratory judgment against the state health department to have the Sanitary Code declared unconstitutional. The health department filed a reconventional demand to enjoin him civilly from selling sewerage treatment systems without submitting installation plans and obtaining a valid permit from the health department. The district court sustained a no cause of action exception filed by the plant owner, holding that the statutes authorizing the health department to draft regulations controlling the manufacture and sale of individual sewerage treatment systems did not contain sufficient guidelines to constitute a constitutional delegation of legislative authority. On review, the court held that the plans and specifications for sewerage works were adequate to support a constitutional delegation of authority and that requirements for issuances of licenses might be inferred from the statutory scheme of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40:1-40:5, as a whole. The criminal provisions were not vague or a bar to a civil proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the victim's request for the submission of special questions to the jury regarding the agency's comparative fault under La. Civ.

The court held that the statute was not vague because the phrase &quot;commonly known as B girls&quot; was a surplus descriptive phrase that did not limit or restrict the word &quot;females.&quot; The court found that adequate notice was given of the prohibition against the employment of females to solicit and accept drinks from patrons for remuneration from retail alcohol dealers. The court rejected defendants' equal protection argument that the statute did not regulate identical conduct by men. The gender-based distinction was justified by a compelling state interest to eradicate the serious problem of paid drinking by women in retail alcohol outlets. The court held that the statute punished men and women equally for employing B-drinkers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the orders of the trial court, which found that a statute prohibiting drinking of alcohol by females for remuneration was unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Fifteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Acadia (Louisiana), which sentenced him to death for his first degree murder conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder. The court remanded the matter for resentencing, and defendant was again sentenced to death. Defendant appealed. The court held that under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.3 the death penalty could not be imposed unless at least one aggravating circumstance was found to exist beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury found one aggravating circumstance: that defendant had &quot;a significant prior history of criminal activity.&quot; La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.4 provided no standard for the term &quot;significant prior history of criminal activity,&quot; left the trial court and jury free to react to nothing more than their own predilections, and failed to channel the jury's discretion to rationally distinguish a case in which the death penalty was imposed from the many in which it was not. The court held that the trial court's jury instruction did not cure the infirmity of art. 905.4(c) because the limiting construction was not sufficient to cure the vagueness of the aggravating factor, and the construction of &quot;significant prior history of criminal activity&quot; as felony convictions involving danger to human life had no basis in art. 905.4(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the Louisiana death penalty statute was unconstitutional as far as it provided for the imposition of the death penalty where a defendant &quot;had a significant prior history of criminal activity.&quot; The court set aside defendant's death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in failing to suppress his inculpatory statement to a trooper because he had not been warned of his Miranda rights and he was too intoxicated to make a knowing waiver. On appeal the court found that although, the trooper erred in not advising defendant of his constitutional rights, the error was inadvertent. The court noted that the police would inevitably have discovered defendant's involvement in the murder because defendant had confessed his crime to a hitchhiker. Defendant also contended that the trial court erred in allowing the state to exercise a peremptory challenge on a juror after she had been sworn in and in allowing gruesome photographs of the homicide to be displayed to the jury after the defense had stipulated that it was the victim's body. On appeal, the court held that there was no prejudice to defendant and no error in the trial court excusing the juror from service and that the probative value of the photographs was outweighed by their prejudicial effect. The court held that the sentence was proper because the evidence supported the jury's conclusion that the murder occurred during the course of an armed robbery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certiorari to review a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Louisiana, Third Circuit, Parish of Calcasieu, which reversed a trial court's grant of defendant's motion to suppress the results of a breath analysis test performed by state troopers using an auto-intoximeter. The issues were whether a motion to suppress was the proper procedural vehicle to test the admissibility of the evidence and whether suppression was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of an auto accident, defendant was charged with negligent homicide. On review, the court held that, pursuant to its authority to establish procedural guidelines in the absence of specific legislative procedural rules, a motion to suppress, using the guidelines set forth in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 703(D), was available to question the admissibility of chemical test results that could raise a legal presumption of intoxication. On the merits, the court held that the admissibility requirements that applied in driving while intoxicated cases had to be satisfied in the case at bar. Further, the principles underlying test results using a photoelectric intoximeter were applicable to the results of the auto-intoximeter test. The correct calibration of the auto-intoximeter using a known alcohol standard was indispensable to the accuracy of the test. But, the regulations of the Department of Public Safety did not designate how, when, or by whom the known alcohol standard was to be determined. Therefore, the State failed to prove that the maintenance regulations were sufficient to insure the accuracy of the results and defendant's motion to suppress was correctly granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The air traffic controllers were employed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and were members of a union when they participated in an organized strike. The FAA ultimately fired the air traffic controllers. Subsequently, the air traffic controllers filed claims for unemployment compensation, but their claims were denied on the basis that they had been discharged for striking against the United States government and for unauthorized absences. The court reversed the judgments denying compensation. Specifically, the court held that the FAA failed to sustain its burden of proving that the air traffic controllers were engaged in willful misconduct at the time of the strike under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1601(2) where the evidence supported the finding that the legality or illegality of the strike called by the union was not clear to the air traffic controllers at the time the strike began and where they reasonably believed during the brief period of the strike that they had a right to participate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who had raped, and drowned a three-year-old girl, was convicted of first-degree murder and was sentenced to death. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the admissibility of inculpatory statements was not a jury question and was properly decided by the trial judge, who also properly rejected an instruction requested by defendant that was not wholly correct, and properly refused to allow cross-examination of a prosecution witness as to possible bias. However, the court vacated the death sentence. When, after one hour of deliberation, the jury asked if a vote for the death penalty had to be unanimous, it was error for the trial judge to refuse defendant's request that the jury be instructed that its inability to arrive at unanimity for the death penalty would automatically result in a life sentence. The circumstances under which the verdict was returned suggested that one juror was pressured to acquiesce in the death penalty merely to reach unanimity. To guide the trial court on remand, the court also held that the rape victim was not an &quot;eyewitness&quot; of that rape constituting an &quot;aggravating circumstance&quot; pursuant to La.

Acts 25 declared unconstitutional, as a prohibited interference with local deployment of home rule charter powers, and to enjoin its enforcement. After a hearing, the Civil District Court Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) entered judgment, declaring the act unconstitutional and enjoining its implementation. Defendant State, through its attorney general, intervened and appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The act, 1983 La. Acts 25, changed the membership of any airport board of a city located outside the parochial site of its airport. New Orleans, Louisiana, was the only city affected by the legislation. It authorized the chief executive officers of another city and two other parishes to select four of the nine members of the New Orleans Aviation Board. Prior to the act, only duly elected officers of New Orleans were authorized to participate in selecting members of the board. The highest court, in agreeing with the trial court, found that the act was unconstitutional because: (a) it purported to change the New Orleans home rule charter's distribution of powers and functions pertaining to the selection and appointment of aviation board members, in violation of La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 6; and, (b) it did not constitute a reasonable exercise of police power, under La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 9(B). Although the act did not take away a city's power to administer its airports through an aviation board, it changed the distribution of this power and function at the local level. It was not necessary to prevent abridgment of a reasonable and valid exercise of the State's police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the Louisiana Supreme Court had affirmed defendant's conviction but reversed the sentence and ordered a new penalty hearing. On remand, after a change of venue and a penalty hearing before a different judge, a different jury recommended capital punishment, and Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Mary, Louisiana, sentenced defendant to death. Defendant appealed the capital sentence only.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant confessed to sexual acts with and killing an 11-year-old girl in a manner the Supreme Court described as being of unparalleled savagery and brutality. The second penalty jury found two aggravating factors: (1) the offender was engaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of aggravated rape; and (2) the offense was committed in an especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel manner. Evidence from a priest and rabbi that the death penalty was immoral was properly excluded since that evidence, although proper for the legislature to consider, did not tend to show how a particular capital defendant should be distinguished from another capital defendant. Defendant's admission was properly admitted under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.2, since evidence offered at trial on the issue of guilt could be admitted in the sentencing phase unless such evidence was fundamentally unfair or inject into the proceedings a substantial risk that the death penalty would be inflicted in an arbitrary or capricious manner. Photographs of the victim's mutilated body were admissible as relevant to whether the murder was committed in an especially cruel, heinous, and atrocious manner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court also concluded after conducting its mandatory proportionality review that the death penalty was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases and affirmed the sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed one person, and then asked where he could find another person. He told police he intended to &quot;get&quot; both people.

Firing at and killing the victim was the act which produced the &quot;prescribed criminal consequence.&quot; Based on the record, the current court found that no rational trier of fact could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant, by firing at the victim, actively intended to kill both the victim and the other person.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from the decision of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal, Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans, Louisiana, reversing defendant's convictions of violating La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14:54.1, by communicating false information of planned arson, finding that the statute and its sentencing provision were unconstitutionally vague and susceptible to two meanings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14:54.1 was susceptible of only one interpretation; i.e., that the crime described consisted of either: (1) intentional threats to commit arson; or (2) intentional communication of false information of an attempt to commit arson, knowing the same to be false. The intermediate appellate court concluded that there was an equally reasonable interpretation. The State's highest appellate court held that the statute was constitutional under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, albeit not as interpreted by the State. The gravamen of the offense was the communication of false information of arson. This was evident from the title of the statute as well as the first clause of the text. The word &quot;threat&quot; was not set off from the term &quot;or false information knowing the same to be false&quot; by a comma; instead the phrase read as a continuous whole, and implied that both the threat and the false information must be known to be false. The State failed to show defendant's statements were made knowing them to be false. Thus, a rational finder of fact could not have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of the offense charged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The intermediate appellate court's decision was amended to the extent that it held that the statute was unconstitutional. However, insofar as the intermediate appellate court's decision reversed defendant's conviction, it was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This was an action to recover unemployment compensation benefits. The employee's petition for judicial review was filed in the district court more than 15 days after the mailing of notice that the board of review had denied his application for appeal from the decision of the appeal tribunal. When the employer raised the issue of the timeliness of the petition, the district court refused to dismiss the action, holding unconstitutional the notice provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 23:1630 and 1634. The question on appeal was whether the pertinent statutes reasonably provided an employee who sought judicial review in an unemployment compensation proceeding with notice and an opportunity to be heard. The court stated that there was no justification for a conclusion that the legislature intended that the 15-day delay in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1630 should run from date of mailing of decisions of the board of review in some instances and from date of receipt in others. The court concluded that the employee failed to rebut the presumption that the notice was mailed on September 2. His appeal, filed more than 15 days thereafter, was untimely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the district court, which found in favor of the employer and denied unemployment compensation benefits to the employee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed his own aunt and her friend after an argument and fight at defendant's home. After killing the aunt, defendant chased down the other victim and shot her in the street after she begged for mercy. The court held that (1) there was no federal constitutional requirement that a state capital sentencing system include a comparison by the appellate court of the death sentence in the particular case under review with the penalties in similar cases, as the system provided adequate protection against the arbitrary imposition of the death penalty; (2) Louisiana's system contained adequate safeguards to insure against the arbitrary imposition of capital punishment; (3) a review of the record did not indicate that the jury exercised its sentencing discretion capriciously or arbitrarily; (4) the sentence imposed was not disproportionate to other sentences imposed in the judicial district; and (5) a review of the penalties imposed by juries in first degree murder cases since 1976 revealed that Louisiana juries generally recommended the death penalty when the offender actually killed more than one person in a single act or in a single consecutive course of conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fifteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Lafayette (Louisiana), convicted defendant of first degree murder and sentenced him to death. Because it was a death penalty case, defendant was provided an automatic appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was stabbed to death at a rest area. Defendant was present at the time of the stabbing, and he had blood other than his own on his hands, although he denied coming within two feet of the victim. He ran out of the bathroom with something in his hand immediately after the victim's scream and moans were heard by a witness. His knife pouch was empty when he was apprehended in the woods. Also, the evidence included a statement by defendant immediately after the incident that he was the one who stabbed the victim. Thus, a reasonable juror could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant used a knife to attempt an armed robbery and stabbed the victim when he resisted. Furthermore, the use of the fact of silence, particularly with respect to defendant's trial testimony that the police refused to listen to his exculpatory version, did not violate due process. Additionally, a review of the case revealed no arbitrary factors which influenced the jury's decision. Therefore, the supreme court concluded that the magnitude and viciousness of the crime and lack of strong factors in mitigation reasonably led the jury to recommend death rather than life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted by a grand jury for aggravated rape in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42. A unanimous jury in the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans, found defendant guilty as charged, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. On appeal, defendant urged two assignments of error for the reversal of his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the life sentence mandated by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42 was unconstitutionally cruel, unusual, and excessive under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The court found that defendant's argument that he should have been charged with forcible rape ignored evidence that defendant abducted and raped his victim at knifepoint and threatened to kill her if she resisted. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1570(A)(5) expressly provided that juvenile court jurisdiction did not extend to a juvenile who, after having become 15 years of age or older, was charged with having committed aggravated rape. Aggravated rape deserved a harsh penalty since it was one of the most violent felonies a person could commit. Mandatory life sentences in Louisiana were imposed only for violent crimes against the person. Compared with the sentencing statutes of other states for the same crime, Louisiana's statute was not facially excessive. Thus, defendant's life sentence for aggravated rape was not disproportionate to his crime and not prohibited as excessive by either the United States or Louisiana Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged his conviction and death sentence on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reviewing and upholding defendant's death sentence, the court considered the factors required for excessiveness review: (1) passion, prejudice, and arbitrary factors; (2) statutory aggravating circumstances; and (3) the sentence's proportionality. First, the State's questions to a defense witness involving potentially improper remarks relating to pardons were not seriously damaging and therefore did not inject an arbitrary factor into the proceedings. Further, the State's argument concerning defendant's prior armed robbery conviction did not invoke the passion of the jury. Second, two aggravating circumstances were established. La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 905.4A(1) and 905.4A(4) (formerly La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 905.4(a) and 905.4(d)) applied. The murders were committed during an aggravated burglary, and the execution of two victims lying side-by-side clearly amounted to a single consecutive course of conduct by which defendant contemplated a great risk to more than one person. Third, defendant's sentence was not disproportionate to those in the cases of other first degree murder defendants in the district where the sentence was imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the court found none of defendant's assignments of error meritorious, defendant's conviction and death sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimant, on behalf of his minor child, alleged defendant doctor committed acts of medical malpractice during the child's delivery. The claimant settled with the doctor for the doctor's maximum statutory liability and reserved the right to obtain excess damages from the Patient's Compensation Fund. Finding that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.44(C)(5), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5105, and La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1732 prohibited a jury trial against the fund; the trial judge declared the statutes unconstitutional on equal protection grounds and denied the commissioner's motion to strike claimant's demand for a jury trial. The court found that the ambiguous reference in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.44(C), providing merely that the amount of damages in excess of the amount already paid by the insurer were set by the court, was insufficient to deprive a claimant of a jury trial. The court held that because there were no laws that expressly denied a medical malpractice claimant a jury trial on the amount of post-settlement damages recoverable from the fund, the claimant was statutorily entitled to trial by jury and thus did not reach the constitutionality issue.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 15:498 to defendant's cross-examination of the victim. The evidence of a single instance of sexual intercourse between the victim and another individual five days prior to the rape was not relevant to a determination of whether the act with defendant was consensual. The fact that the victim consented to intercourse with another man was not probative of her subsequent conduct with defendant. If the evidence were admitted, the victim would be confronted with the accusations of her own chastity, which could not be shown to have any relation to the crime of rape.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the owner was told by the head steward at the track that she had been ruled off the track and that her licenses had been suspended because her husband's license had been suspended, the owner appealed to the racing commission, which did not grant her hearing within 10 days of her steward's hearing as required by La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with taking illegal deer in violation of &sect; 56:123(E)(1). One defendant was found guilty by the trial court and the other pleaded guilty, reserving his right to appeal. Defendants appealed, arguing that &sect; 56:123 was unconstitutional. The court held that there was no vagueness in the prohibition against the hunting of doe deer because &sect; 56:123 clearly directed the reader to consult the regulations of the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Commission, which clearly defined illegal deer. Section 56:123 was not overbroad because the innocent taking of a doe was not a protected freedom. Defendants were not entitled to be read their rights when a Commission agent asked who shot the deer because the agent had not pointed the finger of suspicion at anyone. Defendants' sentences were proper in light of the crime of shooting a doe. However, the trial court did err when it ordered the confiscation of defendants' firearms because there was an ambiguity as to whether La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:33 or La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 891 controlled. Thus, the ambiguity had to be resolved in favor of leniency toward defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant robbed two occupants of a car by impersonating a police officer and searching the car and one victim's purse while pretending to look for drugs. On review, defendant argued that his impersonation did not constitute sufficient force to convict him of simple robbery and that his sentence as a fourth offender was excessive. The court rejected both arguments, holding that (1) when reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational jury could have concluded that the intimidation of a face-to-face confrontation with a purported police officer created a risk of bodily harm, and (2) defendant's sentence as a fourth offender was not excessive. The court reasoned that the trial court sufficiently articulated its concern for society in examining defendant's past convictions to satisfy La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State complained of a judgment of the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans, State of Louisiana, which granted defendants' motions to quash the informations that charged them with falsifying racing license applications, and found La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:118.2&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants applied for work as a cook, stand girl, and nurse, at a racetrack. Each signed a pre-printed form provided by the Louisiana State Racing Commission, certifying that she had neither been convicted of a felony nor been arrested or indicted. Defendants, however, had criminal records and were charged with falsifying racing license applications. The court found that the phrase &quot;racing license&quot; was not defined, and that defendants were classified as permittees and miscellaneous employees because they had sought licenses to engage in a business on the racetrack premises and did not conduct horse races. The court held that absent a statutory directive, it was unable to equate a license issued to a nurse, stand girl, or cook with a racing license merely because the license had been obtained from the Louisiana State Racing Commission, and that a racing license could not be interpreted to include a license for a job as a nurse, stand girl, or cook. The alleged facts, therefore, did not constitute the crime of falsifying a racing license application. Accordingly, the motions to quash were correctly granted because La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:118.2 was not applicable to defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the rulings of the trial judges declaring the statute unconstitutional, and affirmed the judgments granting defendants' motions to quash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the general venire was not selected impartially as required by La. Code Crim. Proc.

A jury commission employee testified that she routinely avoided selecting for the general venire ministers, attorneys, and persons over the age of 70, because these persons were exempt from service under La. Sup. Ct. R. 25. She also testified that she chose members from the way they talked or acted when they registered to vote. Reversing the conviction, the court held that the general venire was not selected impartially, as the constitution and statutes require, and that the general venire was improperly constituted under La. Sup. Ct. R. 25, La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 403, and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, and La. Const. art. V, &sect; 33 (1974).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim identified defendant as one of two assailants who raped her at gunpoint in her hotel room and took her wallet and jewelry. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a motion for a new trial on armed robbery and aggravated rape charges because the alibi evidence was not new or undiscoverable at trial and the third participant's recantation of testimony that defendant was present at the scene would not have been persuasive before a new jury. The court found no abuse of discretion in the determination that defendant was not deprived of the effective use of the evidence by the State's disclosure of a hair analysis on the Friday before the Monday trial. The court found that a witness's gratuitous remarks about other charges against a codefendant did not mandate a mistrial and that the photo lineup did not lead to misidentification, considering the victim's opportunity to view her attackers and certainty that defendant raped her.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants filed a motion with the district court seeking transfers to a less restrictive commitment facility. Instead of deciding the motion on the merits, the district court declared La. Rev. Stat.

Defendants and the State appealed. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the action to the trial court for decision on the merits. The court held that defendants' action was brought after the reenactment and effective date of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 654 and 657 (1982). Thus, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28:59(A) had been superseded and had no application to the motions for transfer. The district court erred in assuming that &sect; 28:59(A) was applicable and in declaring it unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and several others were arrested for gambling with cards in defendant's trailer. A deputy stated that defendant was &quot;cutting from the pot&quot; during the card games, but he was only charged with gambling with cards under the parish ordinance. The ordinance prohibited &quot;non-business&quot; gambling with cards, and therefore proscribed conduct which was not encompassed in the state gambling statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:90, which only prohibited gambling conducted &quot;for business.&quot; Reversing, the court held that La. Const. art. 12, &sect; 6 (1974), requiring the State to define and suppress gambling, required the legislature to preempt the field and to exercise the exclusive authority to define the conduct to be suppressed as gambling. The parish could not constitutionally enact a statute which proscribed as gambling conduct not encompassed by the legislative definition of gambling in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:90(A).</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the injunction on the ground that the act was unconstitutional. The State appealed. The court held for plaintiffs and affirmed. The court noted that because the city owned the park, that the act which created a new park commission as a political subdivision of the State of Louisiana was an unconstitutional taking of the city's property without just compensation in violation of La.

Defendant's attorney agreed to a polygraph exam, but declined to attend. After the polygraphist determined that defendant was not telling the truth, he confronted defendant, who admitted he had committed the rape and two others. Defendant conceded that he waived his right to remain silent during the test, but argued that the waiver did not extend to the post-test questioning. The court held that under the totality of the circumstances, defendant voluntarily waived his Fifth Amendment rights to silence and presence of counsel during his post-test interrogation. Defendant's Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel was not violated because his attorney had the right to be present but chose not to attend. The statement to the polygraphist was admissible because it was given after the polygraph exam and defendant had the option under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:450 to have his entire statement offered in evidence, which would have revealed the polygraph test and his admission to the other rapes, but he chose to have the references to other crimes deleted.

Defendant admitted that he intended to take the boys to his house for a few days. On appeal from his conviction for two counts of attempted simple kidnapping, he challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 14:45(A)(2) and the sufficiency of the evidence. The court rejected defendant's argument that the phrase &quot;unlawful purpose&quot; in the statute failed to give notice to a reasonable person of the conduct that was prohibited. The phrase was not unconstitutionally vague. The statute fairly notified a person who would be tempted to engage in the questionable conduct of luring a child away without the consent of his parents that he did so at his risk if he had any question concerning the &quot;unlawfulness&quot; of his purpose. There was sufficient evidence to establish that defendant acted with a specific intent to decoy the boys away for an unlawful purpose. His admission that he intended to lure the boys to his home and to keep them there either with or without their consent eliminated any reasonable doubt as to the unlawfulness of his purpose.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs claimed ownership to certain property upon which they conducted timber operations. When the State of Louisiana halted their operations on a portion of the property, plaintiffs, with legislative permission to sue, filed a possessory action against the State, alleging that the property on which the timber operations had been halted was attached to an island formed by accretion and that their ancestors in title had taken possession of the property through various acts of corporeal possession for one year prior to the disturbance. The State reconvened, claiming possession of the land and asserting an exception of no cause/right of action. The trial court overruled the State's exceptions and recognized plaintiffs' right to the disputed tract. The appellate court affirmed, finding plaintiffs' possession to have been undisturbed for a year prior to the State's halting of timber operations. The State sought further review, challenging the legality of an individual's maintaining a possessory action against the state. In affirming, the court concluded that a possessory action was available because the disputed property was private rather than public land.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Louisiana retail gasoline merchants brought a class action suit against the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Revenue and Taxation that asked that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:353 be declared unconstitutional as to them and for the refund of occupational license taxes paid under protest. The trial court declared the law unconstitutional and ordered the refunds. In declaring &sect; 47:353&nbsp;unconstitutional, the trial court found that its interaction with federal margin of profits regulations produced a discriminatory effect upon retail gasoline merchants in violation of the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 (1974). On appeal, the court found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:353 created a class of retailers taxed on a sliding scale based on gross profits. The court found that the statute had a rational relationship to a legitimate government purpose, raising revenue. While the tax may have a disproportionately greater impact upon retailers subject to federal profit controls, the court found that no violation of equal protection had been proven.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder. The jury in the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) recommended the death penalty on its finding an aggravating circumstance that defendant committed the murder while engaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of armed robbery or burglary. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought a ruling prohibiting use of his prior record of criminal convictions against him, as evidence of an aggravating circumstance in the sentencing hearing. The court found the amendment of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.4(c), which provided an additional factor, was a substantive change. Subsequent to commission of this crime, but before conviction, the legislature had added the factor that the offender had a significant prior history, which was provable as to defendant and which the jury might have found beyond a reasonable doubt. By addition of this factor, defendant was now exposed to the death penalty, whereas prior to the commission of this murder, he was not. This change was ex post facto and proscribed by the constitution. It appeared the lower court ruled that the state could anticipatorily introduce evidence of defendant's prior convictions. The court held that the state might have introduced prior convictions in its case-in-chief in the penalty phase. The sentencing hearing was not one of those instances where the state was required to affirmatively show that defendant had waived counsel before a prior conviction might have been used to show character.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city sought a declaratory judgment against defendant association. The city asked that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1349(C)(1981) be interpreted so as not to conflict with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1347(1979). Alternatively, the city asked that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1349(C) be declared unconstitutional. The association appealed a decision of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) favoring the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association was composed of local governmental subdivisions formed pursuant to the Local Government Subdivision Self Insurance Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1341, et seq. Upon review, the court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1349(C) violated La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 14(A), insofar as it purported to impose solidary liability on local political subdivisions. The conflict between La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1347, which limited the liability of each association member to contributions and to claims against a particular member, and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1349(C), which made all association members liable in solido for claims not paid by the association, prompted the city to seek a declaratory judgment. The court determined that it was not clear what the legislature intended when it enacted the La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1349(C)(1981). Because it appeared in the section governing excess insurance, &sect; 33:1349(C)(1981) may have been intended to hold an individual member incurring a claim liable for any amount necessary over and above that member's contribution. If that were the intent, the words chosen failed to plainly expressed that meaning.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two juveniles appealed from the district courts' denial of motions to quash informations that would try them as adults. Both juveniles were arrested for armed robbery and asserted that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;13:1570, upon which jurisdiction was based, unconstitutionally deprived them of due process and equal protection, as they did not receive a hearing. On review, the court held that the juveniles were not deprived of important statutory rights and that the State's police power in trying them as adults bore a rational relationship to the legitimate state interest of protecting the public from violent felonies. The court found that legislature intended for 15-16 year olds charged with the enumerated offenses to be treated as adults in every respect. The court held that the statute was fair on its face and did not cause invidious discrimination. The court rejected the assertion that the State had a pattern of charging 16- year-old black armed robbery suspects as adults while adducting other 16-year-old felons as juveniles. The court noted that data showing that only four black juvenile males out of 300 were tried as adults filed to support the invidious discrimination claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with prostitution in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:82(b). Under that statute, a first offense was a misdemeanor, while subsequent offenses were deemed misdemeanors. Because each defendant had previously been convicted of the offense, they were each billed as multiple offenders. Both defendants moved to quash the multiple offender provisions. The trial court granted the motion to quash, and the State petitioned for a writ or certiorari to the court of appeal. The court of appeal transferred both cases to the state supreme court, which consolidated them. In reversing the trial court ruling that quashed the multiple bill of the indictments, the court concluded that the trial court erred in ruling that defendants were denied equal protection because &sect; 14:82 provided for a more harsh penalty for a misdemeanor than it did for a serious felony in regard to the enhancement of penalties. Recidivistic transgressors of felony laws were distinguishable from violators who repeat an offense when it is a misdemeanor in the first instance, and it could not be said that such defendants were similarly situated and denied equal protection under the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complainant, a 15-year old girl, ran away from home, slept with a man whom she met the first night, and had consensual sexual intercourse with defendant on one occasion. In his trial for aggravated rape, defendant sought to rebut the complainant's testimony that he subsequently forced her to engage in sexual intercourse by cross-examining her about her prior sexual conduct with another man shortly before she met defendant. The trial court refused to allow the line of questioning on the ground that responsive testimony would not be admissible under the rape-shield law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:498. The court reversed, because defendant was deprived of his constitutional right to confront and cross-examine witnesses. The cross-examination attempted by defendant's counsel was reasonably calculated to elicit evidence which was relevant, probative, and critical to the defense, and application of the rape shield law to bar the cross-examination did not fully serve the law's purposes. The excluded evidence would have demonstrated the complainant's sexual promiscuity, and would have tended to show that her sexual intercourse with defendant was a part of this same pattern.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the Louisiana Federation of Teachers and others, filed suit in federal district court against defendants, the state, the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, and others, seeking declaratory relief. The district court declared that the Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act (Act), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 17:286.1-17:286.7 violated the Louisiana Constitution. The issue was certified to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question certified to the court by the federal court was whether the Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act (Act), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect;17:286.1-17:286.7, violated La. Const. art. VIII. The court observed that La. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3 created the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education and defined its powers and duties. The court opined that, while the board had the power to supervise and control the state's public schools, which included the determination of educational policy, that power was subject to the direction of the legislature by virtue of the clear language of art. VIII, &sect; 3(A). Further the court found that insofar as the Act represented a legislatively mandated course of study, it comported with the legislature's charge, under La. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, to establish and maintain a public education system. The court concluded that La. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1 unambiguously recognized the legislature's power to provide for, establish, and maintain a public educational system in Louisiana, and that such power included the right to select courses of study for schools in the state. Thus the Act did not violate La. Const. art. VIII.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the question certified to it in the negative; the Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act did not violate the Louisiana Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being charged with obscenity, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106(A)(1), defendants were convicted in the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) of attempted obscenity. On appeal, they argued that a pre-arrest adversary hearing should have been held pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106(F), that they were misjoined as defendants, that the evidence was insufficient to convict, and that &sect; 14:106(A)(1) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two undercover police officers visited a theater, where, in separate booths, each viewed one defendant exposing her genitals. Both defendants were arrested. On appeal, the court held that the requirement of a hearing under &sect; 14:106(F) applied only to printed matter, photographs, and films. The prosecution was properly instituted, despite the lack of a prior judicial determination that the conduct was obscene. The evidence showed that defendants were engaged, with others, in a common, ongoing, commercial, criminal enterprise, they were aware of their joint purpose, and they showed no prejudice, so there was no error in their being tried jointly. The court held that the evidence was sufficient for conviction. Even though the activity occurred in private booths, the theater was a public place. That they exposed their genitals had been shown. Obscenity under &sect; 14:106(A)(1) was not an inchoate offense. It was no defense to an attempt charge that the offense was actually completed, so the verdict of attempted obscenity was not irrational. Section 14:106(A)(1) was not vague or overbroad, and defendants' conduct was beyond the scope of any protection afforded by U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendants' convictions and their sentences of fines of $ 1,000 plus suspended one-year jail terms, with two years of probation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parish school board sought to collect, from defendant car leasing company, a tax on the proceeds from auto leases to parish residents. The parish filed a rule to show cause why the leasing company should not have been ordered to cease doing business until it paid delinquent lease taxes and costs. The district court denied the school board's demands. The court of appeal (Louisiana) affirmed. The court granted the school board's writs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The leasing company contended that the lease tax sought to have been imposed by the school board was unconstitutional because, when enacted by Acts 1964, No. 29, the title of the act had not included a reference to a tax on the lease of property. La. Const. art. III, &sect; 15(A) required that every bill be confined to one object and contain a brief title indicative of its object. The court found the act's title sufficient to give notice of the scope of the proposed legislation. The title indicated that the act's purpose was to authorize school boards to levy and collect sales and use tax. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2737(B) provided that the sales tax so levied was levied upon the sale at retail, the use, the lease or rental, the consumption and storage for use or consumption. This was not a lease tax separate from sales tax, but a sales tax on sales and leases. By contrast, Acts 1948, No. 9 created a tax on the sale and use of property in its &sect; 2(a) and created a tax on the lease of property in its &sect; 2(b). It was not inconsistent that the title of that act referred to both sales tax and a separate lease tax. Yet, there remained some controversy over the exact amount of the tax debt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments of the district court and the court of appeal were set aside. Judgment was entered in favor of the parish school board and against the leasing company for a two percent tax on leases as provided by the ordinance and the joint service agreements. The case was remanded to the district court for a determination of the amounts due. The leasing company was cast for all costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the mayor gave a speech to the council announcing his veto of an ordinance the council had recently enacted, the mayor left the meeting and the city, officially appointing one of the councilmen acting mayor. Despite the provisions of New Orleans, La., Home Rule Charter &sect;&sect; 3-107 and 2-204(3) prohibiting him from doing so, the councilman/acting mayor voted to override the mayor's veto of the ordinance at issue, providing a crucial vote in favor of the override. Thereafter, when the councilman was no longer acting mayor, the council met again, reconsidered the earlier vote, and again voted to override. On review, the court held that, based on the principle of separation of powers, New Orleans, La., Home Rule Charter &sect; 3-113(3) permitted only one attempt to override a mayor's veto. Nor had the appointment of the councilman as acting mayor effectively reduced the size of the council such that, even with the exclusion of the invalid vote, the ordinance was properly overridden. Under &sect;&sect; 2-204(3) and 3-113(3), the membership of the council was not altered by the appointment and two-thirds of the entire council had to vote to adopt an ordinance in order to override a veto.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which convicted him by jury of first degree murder and sentenced him to death upon the jury's recommendation after the trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress his inculpatory statements and evidence seized from his car and person that defendant alleged were fruits of an illegal arrest made without probable cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A victim was raped and murdered during a burglary. Police stopped defendant the next day after an anonymous informant told them that he could be found, with the victim's property, in a white Chevette-type car near the murder scene. The officer who stopped defendant saw marijuana in the car, and arrested defendant. The victim's jewelry was found in the car. Defendant confessed to the robbery but claimed an accomplice later killed the victim. Probable cause for arrest existed once the officer saw the drugs. At issue was whether the officer's actions prior to the arrest constituted a valid investigatory stop. The officer's testimony and actions showed that he was only conducting a stop and not an arrest. The stop was the type that was reasonable in view of the public interest at stake, a murder investigation, and the small degree of intrusion involved. The stop was warranted by a reasonable suspicion based on specific facts and rational inferences from those facts in that the informant's knowledge made it probable that his story was reliable and there was little chance that the tip could have been fabricated by police after the stop. The motion to suppress was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

Defendants, the illegitimate children of the decedent, filed an exception of no right or cause of action. The Nineteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) sustained the children's exception and dismissed the decedent's sister's lawsuit. The sister appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was survived by four duly acknowledged illegitimate children. The decedent was also survived by two legitimate siblings. The decedent, who died testate, left his entire estate to his four children. The will was eventually probated, and the district court entered a judgment of possession recognizing the four children as heirs and placing them in possession of the property. In her action, the decedent's sister alleged that the decedent was prohibited, under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1486, from leaving more than one-fourth of his property to his acknowledged illegitimate children because he was survived by legitimate sisters and brothers. The sister also alleged that the detailed descriptive list of decedent's property was incorrect in that it omitted certain succession debts. The court agreed with the district court that art. 1486, which limited the amount an illegitimate child could receive by donation from his natural father to one-fourth of his father's property if the father left legitimate ascendants or legitimate siblings, was unconstitutional.&nbsp;La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 specifically prohibited arbitrary discrimination against a person because of illegitimacy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court judgment. The court remanded the case to the trial court to permit the decedent's sister to amend her petition in an attempt to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

The parish police jury appealed and argued that the ordinance was a proper exercise of police power. The court reversed and held that the ordinance was neutral on its face, there was no contention that it would be applied in less than an equal manner, and there was no fundamental right or suspect classification involved. The court further held that an individual's right not to be deprived of property without due process of law must be balanced against the police power of governing authorities to protect the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the people. The court held that the section of the ordinance that limited the bingo games was rationally related to the control and supervision of such games within the parish and did not offend the constitutional guarantees of substantive due process.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of first degree murder of the woman and sentenced to death. On initial appeal by defendant, his conviction was conditionally affirmed; the sentence vacated; and the case remanded to determine whether a printed note found near the murder scene created a reasonable doubt about his guilt; and, if not, to hold a new penalty hearing by a jury as provided by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.1. The trial court again sentenced defendant to death and defendant appealed. The court affirmed and held that the trial court did not err in not allowing defendant to call the original 12 jurors to establish what effect a note found in the woods might have had on their decision because there was no authority for recalling the jurors and the statutory law specifically prohibited impeachment of a verdict by a member of the jury. The court held that any error in charging the jury as to another aggravating factor was harmless, because there was clear proof of one aggravating factor found by the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, members of the Islamic religion, lived together with two other adult women and 13 minor children. One of the children died, and the autopsy revealed that he had suffered torture and extreme hunger. Defendants were indicted for second degree murder and, following a bench trial, were convicted. On appeal, they raised numerous points of error. However, the court affirmed their convictions, concluding that their contentions were meritless. Specifically, the court held that defendants' waiver of a trial by jury did not effect a waiver of their right to change venue, but there was no evidence justifying a presumption that they could not obtain a fair trial due to a trial atmosphere utterly corrupted by press coverage. The defendants failed to demonstrate that their attorney possessed an actual conflict of interest in their joint representation such that they were denied his effective assistance. Defendants were present during the reference to and detailed explanation of the waiver of jury trial but voiced no objection. Moreover, the evidence of the condition of defendants' family was evidence of intent, and was admissible as a recognized exception to the rule of exclusion.</SPAN></P>

The employee filed a third-party demand for indemnity against the state. The court held that the trial court properly overruled the state's motion for summary judgment because the state was obliged by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5108.2 to indemnify and hold the employee harmless from financial loss arising out of a claim that he was negligent while acting in the scope of his employment. The court held that the district attorney's employee served in an office of the judicial branch and was a state employee for the purposes of &sect; 13:5108.2. The court held that the trial court should not have passed on the question of whether La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:1441 was constitutional because it was not essential to the case or controversy.

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, vacated defendant's sentence, and remanded for resentencing, holding that there was no reason why &sect; 14:95.1 should not have equally applied to a person who was automatically pardoned under La.

The trial court properly denied defendant's request for a continuance, as defendant did not state how the severance prejudiced his case. The trial judge's remarks concerning the evidence did not violate La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 772, as they merely explained his ruling and were not prejudicial. Although the prosecutor's arguments may have exceeded the scope of the evidence presented, they were not so prejudicial as to warrant a mistrial or fall within the grounds for a mistrial under La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By writ of certiorari plaintiffs, patient and her husband, sought review of a judgment of the Court of Appeal, First Circuit, Parish of Tangipahoa (Louisiana), which affirmed a trial court judgment sustaining a peremptory exception of prescription and dismissing the patient's suit for medical malpractice against defendants hospital and doctors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1977, when the patient was at the hospital for an appendectomy, the doctors performed a hysterectomy. Neither she nor her mother remembered signing a consent to the hysterectomy. The following year the patient began to suffer abdominal pains. When she went to the hospital she was sent home with a prescription and without an examination. In 1981, another doctor discovered that the 1977 surgery left part of the patient's intestine in her stomach. The court of appeal affirmed a trial court judgment, holding that the suit was prescribed pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628. The court affirmed the judgment as it related to the patient's cause of action for damages arising out of the 1977 operation and/or the lack of consent. The doctrine of contra non valentem agere nulla currit praescriptio did not apply to except the suit from prescription because &sect; 9:5628 legislatively overruled that doctrine as it might apply to actions for medical malpractice. However, the patient's malpractice cause of action for misdiagnosing her post-surgical condition did not prescribe because she did not know of the cause of her pain until 1981,which was less than one year before suit was filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment sustaining the exception of prescription insofar as it related to the patient's cause of action for damages arising out of a 1977 operation and/or the lack of consent thereto, but reversed dismissal of the patient's suit insofar as it related to an independent cause of action for damages for the alleged misdiagnosis and/or failure to properly treat systems that the patient brought to the doctors' attention in 1981.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged a judgment of the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) resentencing defendant to 20 years imprisonment at hard labor. The state contended that the sentencing court erred by finding that defendant's original sentence to life imprisonment for aggravated rape under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant was convicted of aggravated rape under &sect; 14:42, his maximum possible sentence was death, but the jury had the option of recommending life imprisonment. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment, and thereafter the sentencing statute was changed to require death for a conviction of aggravated rape. That statute was thereafter declared unconstitutional and the maximum penalty was changed to 20 years imprisonment. Defendant filed a motion to vacate his sentence and the sentencing court granted his motion, sentencing him to 20 years. The state appealed and on appeal the court held that because defendant was sentenced under the previous statute, and he had been sentenced to life imprisonment, which was what death sentences had been commuted to, defendant's sentence was not improper. The court also found that defendant's claim that his sentence was not proportional to the sentences of other subsequently convicted rapists was without merit. The court reasoned that defendant was properly sentenced because he was sentenced under the statute in effect at the time of sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the sentencing court's resentencing of defendant, remanding the case to the trial court for resentencing to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city appealed a judgment of the Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), made in favor of defendant governor that affirmed the trial court's denial of an injunction to stop enforcement of 1982 La. Acts 352. The court of appeal decreed &sect; 3(E)(2) of Act 352 unconstitutional as it was a local or special law, and there had not been notice per the La. Const. art. 3, &sect; 13 (1974), but it upheld the remainder of Act 352.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1982 La. Acts 352 abolished the Audubon Park Commission and created a new Audubon Park Commission as a state agency within a department of the state. The La. Const. art. 3, &sect; 13 required publication of notice of the intention to introduce a local or special law, and there had been no publication for Act 352.The court found that even if the funding required of the city for the park were proportional to the benefits to the city none of the surrounding parishes that derived substantial benefits from the park and that were represented on the park's commission were required to give any funds for the park; New Orleans Parish was the only parish required to give funds for the park's operation; Act 352 did not provide for state funding. In addition, Act 352 allowed the State to take control of two parcels of property owned by the city in the park; thus, Act 352 had an immediate and significant impact only on the people of New Orleans. It did not operate equally and uniformly on all persons and parishes that derived benefits from the park and that were represented on the park's commission. Ergo, the court ruled that Act 352 was a local or special law; thus, publication was a prerequisite.</SPAN></P>

One ran back inside to get a pool stick, claiming that the other was armed with a knife. Defendant got his pistol and went outside. He ordered the patron to drop the knife and shot him when he failed to comply. Defendant maintained that the pistol accidentally discharged. He was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 15 years at hard labor. The court affirmed the sentence and held that it was not constitutionally excessive. The trial court on remand complied with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 by stating for the record the reasons and factual basis for its sentencing decision. The court found that several of the mitigating factors set forth in art. 894.1(B) were present and weighed in favor of the imposition of a lesser sentence. However, the evidence supported the trial judge's conclusion that defendant did not act under strong provocation and that the victim's conduct did not induce the killing. Although it did not appear that there was an undue risk that defendant would commit another crime, the other aggravating factors set forth in art. 894.1(A) were present.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Criminal District Court Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) of first degree murder and the same jury unanimously recommended a death sentence. On appeal, he argued, inter alia, that the exclusion of prospective jurors opposed to the death penalty prejudiced the rest of the jury, his motion for a mistrial should have been allowed, his requested jury instructions were improperly refused, and a death sentence was excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While he was robbing a 70-year-old man, defendant, without provocation, shot him in the head. On appeal, the court held that the jurors were properly excused, because each stated that he or she could not vote to impose the death penalty even in light of evidence which might be developed in the trial or in consideration of the law which governed the case. Because the State did not exhaust the peremptory challenges available to it, even if the trial court erroneously granted the State's request that one juror be excused for cause, defendant could not challenge the ruling on appeal. Because an admonition by the trial judge was sufficient to remove any prejudice that remarks by the prosecutor might have caused, defendant's motion for a mistrial was properly denied. Each of the instructions requested by defendant was either included in the trial judge's instructions or was an incorrect statement of the law which would have required correction or further explanation. One aggravating circumstance was enough to support the death sentence. Given the nature of the crime, the sentence was proportional to other death sentences and there was no evidence that the jury was racially prejudiced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Louisiana Commission on Ethics for Public Employees, challenged the judgment of the Court of Appeal, First Circuit, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), that reversed its decision that appellee, a public official and member of the state mineral board, had violated La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:1111(C)(2)(d) of the Code of Ethics for Governmental Employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A public official was a member of the state mineral board, which administered the state's proprietary interest in minerals and had authority to lease state land. The official was also the sole stockholder of a corporation that made sales on a non-bid negotiated basis to seven companies that held state mineral leases. The Ethics Commission found a conflict of interest, ordered the official to resign, and barred him from future public service for four years. The court of appeals reversed that ruling, holding that the Code of Ethics for Governmental Employees did not prohibit business dealings between state mineral lessees and legal entities wholly-owned by a mineral board member. The Ethics Commission appealed. In reversing, the court concluded that the ethics code expressly forbid a public official to receive anything of economic value for or in consideration of services rendered to any person who did business with his government agency. The separate corporate entity privilege was not without limits and did not permit a public official to use his wholly-owned and controlled corporation to do that which the ethics code expressly forbid him from doing in his individual capacity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Personnel of defendant corporation were steam-cleaning a railroad car containing residual chemicals when the chemical reaction caused an extremely offensive smell to escape into the atmosphere.

Ann. &sect; 30:1073(F) of the Louisiana Environmental Affairs Act, and the Air Quality Regulations. The supreme court affirmed the quashing of the indictment. It held that while the standards set forth in the Air Control law itself were sufficient to effectuate a constitutional delegation of authority, the regulations the corporation was charged with violating, La. Admin. Code tit. 14, &sect;&sect; 11:17.11, 17.10, 8.2, and by reference, 4.74, which included the vague term &quot;undesirable levels,&quot; failed to adequately inform potential defendants of what conduct was prohibited by law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the question was whether La. Admin. Code tit. 17-11, &sect; 14.6, was clear to the average citizen. The state supreme court concluded that the regulation was not unconstitutionally vague because it gave an individual adequate notice of the proscribed conduct and it provided adequate standards for those charged with determining the guilt or innocence of an accused. Defendant also argued that the delegation of legislative authority to the Secretary of Public Safety was unconstitutional because it was not accompanied by a sufficient basic standard and rule of action for guidance of the instrumentality or officer that was to administer the law. The state supreme court concluded that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40:1471.1-1471.22 properly delegated authority to the Secretary of Public Safety to make, promulgate, and enforce regulations covering explosives because the procedural safeguards incorporated in the statutes, coupled with the dictates of Louisiana's Administrative Procedures Act, La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's motion to suppress evidence was denied, defendant was convicted of possession of cocaine in the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana). Prior to sentencing, the trial court sustained defendant's motion in arrest of judgment. The trial court then granted the state's motion for an appeal from that adverse ruling, pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 912(B)(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under former La. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(D)(2), a case was appealable to the Louisiana Supreme Court &quot;only&quot; where defendant had been &quot;convicted&quot; of a felony or a fine exceeding $ 500 dollars or imprisonment exceeding 6 months actually had been imposed. In the instant case, defendant had not been &quot;convicted&quot; of a felony. The effect of the order arresting judgment was to place defendant in the same situation in which he was before the indictment was found or the information filed. Hence, the effect of sustaining the motion in arrest of judgment by the trial court was to strike down the conviction. However, the appellate court treated the state's appeal as an application for a writ of review. The State contended the trial judge erred in sustaining defendant's motion in arrest of judgment on a ground other than that listed in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 859. The trial court sustained the motion in arrest of judgment, as evidence adduced at trial was contrary to testimony at the suppression hearing. Thus, the judgment was arrested on a ground other than that listed in art. 859, and the trial court erred in sustaining defendant's motion in arrest of judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's appeal was dismissed, and the State's application for a writ of review was granted. The ruling of the trial court sustaining defendant's motion in arrest of judgment was reversed and set aside. The case was remanded to the trial court with instructions to rule on defendant's motion for a new trial and to proceed in accordance with law.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court held that establishing a plan to pay witness fees for all law enforcement officer witnesses called in the Criminal District Court for the Parish of Orleans was not one of those constitutionally enumerated powers of the commission. Further, the state Legislature had not by the 1974 constitution been given any power to supplement the powers and functions of the commission. Moreover, to have allowed the state legislature to add to the powers and functions of the commission would be to allow the legislature to impede the commission's ability to accomplish the objectives and purposes of the merit system of civil service as established in La. Const. art. 10 &sect; 10(A)(1). Under the 1974 Louisiana Constitution, civil service commissions were autonomous bodies with circumscribed duties.

The Fourteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Calcasieu (Louisiana), sentenced him to 18 months in the parish prison. Several minutes later, at defense counsel's request, the trial judge vacated the sentence for the purpose of hearing defense counsel speak in mitigation of defendant's punishment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court violated constitutional and statutory sentencing procedures and imposed an unconstitutionally excessive sentence. The State and defense counsel believed that the defendant had no prior criminal record. Before resentencing defendant the following day, the trial judge independently inquired into whether he had a juvenile record. He discovered that defendant, under a different name, had twice been adjudicated a delinquent for burglary and theft in the prior four years. The trial judge confirmed this information in open court. In affirming the increased sentence, the court held that the trial court amended or changed the sentence prior to the beginning of the execution of his 18 month sentence as allowed by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881. The court held that the trial judge satisfied due process by carefully articulating his reasons in imposing a heavier penalty upon resentencing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners sought relief under La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18:1294. The police jury argued that La. Const. art.

The intermediate appellate court held in two of the cases that the owners' exclusive remedy was to proceed under La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 47:2110. The state's highest appellate court held that the availability of remedies set forth in La. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 47:2110 and 18:1294 was dependent upon the authority by which the tax was imposed. La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 47:2110 set forth the method by which the payment of an ad valorem tax could be resisted when the tax was not authorized by an election. La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18:1294 was applicable only when the tax was authorized by an election. The contested ad valorem tax was authorized by La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 33(B). Therefore, La. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought to try defendant as an adult. Defendant contended that the legislature could not constitutionally create classes of juveniles for treatment as adults determined by the age and offense. The appellate court held that La.

Stat. &sect; 13:1570(A)(5) did not violate defendant's equal protection rights. The statute had a rational basis, related to the achievement of a legitimate State interest in the protection of its citizens, by exposing older minors, accused of committing serious and violent felonies, to the usual procedures of the State's criminal law system. The classifications were not arbitrary. Finally, the use of defendant's biological, as opposed to mental, age did not violate defendant's equal protection rights. The age classifications bore a rational relationship to the State's legitimate interest in protecting its citizens. The use of chronological age afforded offenders the most reasonable, fair, and even-handed method available to the State in making classifications.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State seized two vehicles allegedly owned by defendant and instituted a proceeding under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:1550 to forfeit them as contraband. The basis for the seizure was an affidavit by the state police that recited defendant's participation in two drug transactions that were observed by police but for which defendant had not been convicted. Defendant moved for the release of the automobiles on the ground that the forfeiture statute was unconstitutional. After a hearing, the district court denied defendant's motion. The court granted defendant's application for a review of the ruling and affirmed. The court held that the automobiles constituted a type of contraband, and therefore subject to forfeiture, because there was probable cause to believe that defendant used the vehicles to transport illicit drugs to a rendezvous point where he engaged in unlawful distribution of them in violation of the controlled dangerous substances law. The court held that the State had not violated defendant's due process rights by postponing his arrest to preserve an ongoing police undercover operation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial judge's denial of defendant's motion to return the vehicles and remanded the case for a speedy trial of the forfeiture proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appeal from the judgment of the 29th Judicial District Court for the Parish of St. Charles, State of Louisiana, which convicted him of first degree murder for killing an 11 year old girl after raping her and sentenced him to death after the jury was instructed that they were required to impose the death sentence if they found that the evidence established the existence of one or more aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">None of defendant's assignments of error warranted reversal of his conviction. In particular, defendant's confession was given freely and voluntarily in compliance with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:451, despite his low intelligence, where he understood his Miranda rights, which were explained five times in simple language. The evidence showed that he was capable of understanding the nature of the proceedings against him and in aiding in his defense and that he did not suffer from a mental disease or defect that rendered him incapable of distinguishing right from wrong at the time of the offense. However, the judge's instructions to the jurors required that defendant receive a new sentencing hearing. Under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.3, the jury could consider recommending the death penalty upon finding that the State had proved one or more aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. It was not required to return such a recommendation. The mandatory instruction deprived the jury of its sentencing discretion, which was vital to the constitutionality of the capital sentencing scheme and was not cured by the trial judge's detailed explanation of mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction but vacated his death sentence and remanded the case to the trial court for a new penalty hearing in accordance with the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of forcible rape and sentenced to 40 years at hard labor. Defendant challenged his sentence of 40 years at hard labor under the forcible rape statute as excessive punishment in violation of La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20 (1974). Twice previously, the court remanded this case to the trial court to resentence defendant after conducting a presentence hearing, and for resentencing after stating for the record the considerations taken into account and the factual basis therefor in imposing sentence as required by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. The court reheard the case and found defendant's sentence to be disproportionally excessive in one respect and unlawfully lenient in another, and amended the sentence to 25 years imprisonment at hard labor, two years of which shall be without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. Defendant used physical force to enter the victim's car and prevent her from fleeing, but the victim only sustained scratches, cuts and bruises. Defendant also did not have a weapon or show a weapon in committing the rape. Given defendant's remorse and the factors of the criminal conduct, the court entered a mid-range sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his wife went to a bar where defendant robbed the bartender, a customer, and a barmaid before shooting the customer in the head, killing him.

Defendant appealed and claimed that his confession was not voluntary and that the sentence was erroneous. The court affirmed the conviction and ordered resentencing. The court held that defendant's confession, made shortly after his arrest, was voluntary because defendant was coherent and he responded to the questioning without impairment. The court held that the trial court's instruction regarding aggravating circumstance was plainly erroneous because the trial judge instructed the jurors at the penalty hearing that they were obliged to recommend the death penalty if they found that the prosecution had established an aggravating circumstance. Because there was no doubt an aggravating circumstance existed, the judge's instruction was tantamount to a directed verdict of a death sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent's acknowledged illegitimate daughter intervened in his widow's succession proceedings to claim that she was entitled to his property in the widow's possession. The appellate court sustained the widow's exception of no cause of action and prospectively applied a case, which declared that the statute barring an illegitimate child's inheritance was unconstitutional. On original hearing, the appellate court was reversed and the case was applied retroactively to coheirs in intestate successions and prospectively in testate successions. On the widow's application for a rehearing, the court vacated the original opinion and applied the case retroactively to the effective date of the 1974 Louisiana Constitution, the provisions of which foreshadowed the case. The court sustained the exception to the petition, which stated no cause of action because the father died in September 1971. The court found that limited retroactive application furthered the case's purpose of vindicating the constitutional rights of illegitimates and did not seriously disrupt land titles for a prolonged period of time.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that their uncle and deceased father were the illegitimate children of the grandfather. Plaintiffs brought their action in 1980, 42 years after the grandfather's death in 1938. Plaintiffs asserted their right to inherit a portion of the grandfather's property under a 1980 decision of the court, which held that La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 919, barring illegitimate children from inheriting from their natural fathers in the same manner as legitimates, was unconstitutional. After issuing certiorari, the court affirmed the judgments of the appellate court and trial court in holding that plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action. Art. 919 was found to constitute an unreasonable discrimination that bore no rational relationship to a legitimate state interest and was violative of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 (1974). The court determined that the decision holding La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 919&nbsp;unconstitutional would be retroactively applied only to January 1, 1975, the effective date of the present Louisiana Constitution. Since the purported grandfather died in 1938, plaintiffs' action was barred irrespective of whether they could prove their father's filiation to the grandfather.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued that its home rule charter gave it the exclusive right to regulate matters of local concern and that payments mandated by the legislature unconstitutionally affected the organization of its government. The court reversed the judgment, finding that under La. Const. art. 14, &sect; 22 (1921), the city's home rule charter was not a part of the 1921 Louisiana Constitution and that home rule was subject to other constitutional limitations. Thus, the trial court erred in holding that certain contested acts violated the Louisiana Constitution of 1921. Further, the court determined that the autonomy of local governmental subdivisions with home rule charters was limited by general legislation enacted under the State's police power. The court also determined that in the absence of a particular constitutional provision that limited the power of the legislature to act, a legislative action could not be invalidated as contrary to the Louisiana Constitution. Because the legislative acts mandating payments by the city constituted a valid exercise of the State's police power, the court concluded that the trial court erred in declaring the legislative acts unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner parents of an infant appealed from a judgment of the Juvenile Court for the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which dismissed their action for a declaratory judgment to discontinue life support of their comatose infant. The juvenile court held that it lacked jurisdiction, that there was no justiciable issue, and that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.36.1 was an unconstitutional intrusion into the powers and functions of the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court noted that 1982 La. Acts 339 indirectly recognized the incompetent person's right to have such systems terminated. The court, contrary to the findings of the juvenile court, found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.36.1(C) recognized the right of a permanently comatose child to have his parents and physicians discontinue artificially sustained life under certain conditions. On this basis, the court concluded that a permanently comatose child had an independent right to discontinuance of artificially sustained life through the mechanical invasion of the child's body. The court held, therefore, that an appropriate representative could judicially assert that right on behalf of the child, either after the event in civil or criminal proceedings or before the event in a declaratory judgment action. The court further held that the juvenile court had jurisdiction to adjudicate proceedings involving the exercise of the child's right, as well as the jurisdiction to adjudicate an action for a declaratory judgment. The court concluded that the juvenile court erred in declaring &sect; 40:1299.36.1(C)&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
