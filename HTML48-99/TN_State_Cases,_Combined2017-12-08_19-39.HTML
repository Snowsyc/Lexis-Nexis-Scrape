</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two years prior to the enactment of the 1973 Tenn. Pub. Acts 318, the acquitted individual was charged, tried, and acquitted of a criminal offense. The Act provided for the permanent destruction of records on charges that had been dismissed. In opposition to the acquitted individual's petition, it was contended that the Act was a violation of Tenn. Const. art. 2, &sect; 17 because it repealed the former laws of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18-105 and 18-402, which required clerks to maintain records of all proceedings. The court held that 1973 Tenn. Pub. Acts 318 made no mention of an intent to repeal Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18-105 and 18-402. The court found that in the absence of such language, the statutes were repealed by implication. The court determined that a repeal by implication was not a violation of Tenn. Const. art. 2, &sect; 17.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant government challenged a judgment from the Sixth Circuit Court for the County of Davidson (Tennessee), which dismissed the government's appeal in favor of appellee citizen, holding that the Metropolitan Charter did not grant the government a right of appeal de novo from a judgment dismissing a charge of violating a city ordinance and that granting such an appeal would violate double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen was arrested by police officers and charged with interfering with a police officer, which in the warrant of arrest was charged as a violation of Metropolitan Nashville-Davidson County, Tenn., Metropolitan Code &sect; 34-1-1. The court held that a proceeding in a municipal court for the imposition of a fine on a person for allegedly violating a city ordinance was criminal rather than civil in substance in that it sought punishment to vindicate public justice; therefore it constituted jeopardy under the double jeopardy clauses of Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and U.S. Const. amend. V. The court observed that the alleged offender, whether acquitted or convicted, could not be tried again for the same offense in a state trial court of general jurisdiction over the offender's timely objection. The court concluded that neither the Metropolitan Charter nor Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 27-509 could be construed to authorize the appeal the government sought because then those laws would be unconstitutional. The court agreed with the dismissal of the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two defendants were charged in separate indictments with grand larceny of cattle and receiving and concealing stolen property, namely, the cattle. The trial court also charged the jury as to petit larceny. Defendants were jointly tried. The jury could not agree upon a verdict, and there was a colloquy between the trial judge and the jurors during which the jurors said they found that defendants were not guilty of grand larceny because they lacked the intent to steal the cattle. The trial court declared a mistrial, and the case was continued until the next term. The trial judge ruled that defendants were not guilty of grand larceny but that the remaining offenses were to be tried. The appellate court ruled that defendants could not seek review by writ of certiorari. Reversing, the court held that a second trial would have violated defendants' double jeopardy rights. The jury should not have been charged as to petit larceny because the essential element of an intent to steal was lacking. Because the jury found that defendants had no intention of stealing, they also could not have had any guilty knowledge that they were concealing stolen property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a trial, defendant was convicted. He appealed his judgment to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Tennessee. When that court denied his appeal, he petitioned the Supreme Court of Tennessee for certiorari. It was denied. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari, reversed his conviction, and remanded the case to the Court of Criminal Appeals. That court remanded the case for a new trial. The State petitioned for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his trial, defendant called two other witnesses and then asked permission to testify. The trial court denied his request, even though the prosecutor waived any objection under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-2403. A United States Supreme Court decision declared the statute unconstitutional five months after defendant's trial. His appeal was pending at that time. The court explained that where defendant was specifically excluded from testifying for failing to do so first, the truth-finding function of the trial court could have been so substantially impaired as to raise serious question about the accuracy of a guilty verdict. The court ruled that retroactive application was necessary. The court believed that the impairment of the fact-finding function of the trial court was quite substantial if defendant was denied the benefit of the decision of the United States Supreme Court. The court added that defendant was denied the right to testify as a witness in his own defense at the time the &quot;guiding hand of counsel&quot; considered the most effective and appropriate. The court added that retroactive application did not have any chaotic effect upon the administration of justice in Tennessee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff advertisers sought review of the judgment of the Chancery Court of Marion County (Tennessee), which granted a motion to dismiss in favor of defendant Commissioner of the Department of Transportation of the State of Tennessee in the action filed by the advertisers that requested the issuance of permits and alleged that the Billboard Regulation &amp; Control Act of 1972, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 54-2601 et seq., was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The facts indicate that, after the advertisers erected a number of outdoor signs or billboards, they were notified that the signs did not conform to the Act. The advertisers alleged that it would be inequitable and unconscionable for the Commissioner to destroy their signs in view of the fact that they were informed that their locations had been approved and that their applications were going to be approved. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss on the ground that the suit was not filed in the county of the Commissioner's official residence. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's judgment was correct. The court noted that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-404 required actions against the department heads to be taken up in the county of the department head's official residence and it prohibited transitory actions against him in other counties. The court stated that the original complaint that sought a mandatory order and the amended complaint that requested a declaration that the controlling statute was unconstitutional were transitory and fell within the rule of &sect; 4-404. The court concluded that the advertisers could take the action to the appropriate forum if they desired.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The testator's will was probated, and her husband dissented and petitioned to have the probate court set aside his statutory share as a surviving spouse. The contestants responded, denying that the husband was entitled to any allowances or support. The probate court appointed commissioners to set aside a year's support for the husband, and they filed a report. The contestants challenged the report on the ground that the provisions of the statutes allowing a year's support to a surviving husband were unconstitutional. The probate court held that the statutes were constitutional, and the contestants appealed, insisting that there was no duty on the part of a wife to support her husband. The court affirmed and remanded for further proceedings in the administration of the estate. 1969 Tenn. Pub. Acts, ch. 135 amended four code sections dealing with the statutory allowances to family members and to make the sections no longer applicable solely to a widow, but to provide certain statutory benefits to any surviving spouse, irrespective of sex. The statutes were constitutional and were in keeping with the general trend to eliminate or minimize distinctions based on sex alone.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the petitions, but also held that chapter 318 of the Public Acts of 1973, codified as Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-4001 et seq., was unconstitutional. The court reversed in part, holding that the statute was not unconstitutional. The court affirmed the dismissal of the accused's petitions because the statute did not apply where the accused pled guilty to charges the against him.

The husband deeded the county the land without his wife's consent or signature. The wife contested the appellate court's decision that directed that her award be held by the trial court clerk until the death of her husband, at which time the wife was entitled to payment. The court affirmed the judgment in the wife's favor but ordered that she be paid the money immediately. In considering the nature of an estate of tenants by the entirety in Tennessee, the court concluded that the common law disability of coverture had been eradicated. The court did not abolish the establishment of a tenancy by the entirety, but removed from it the archaic rules imposed at common law. The court held that each tenant had a joint right to the use, control, and rents of the property and was unable to sell the property without the consent of the other tenant. Because everyone in this action received what they had bargained for except the wife, the court held that she was presently entitled to her award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner suspended the insurers' authority to do business in Tennessee, and the insurers were declared insolvent subsequent to July 1, 1971, the effective date of the Tennessee Insurance Guaranty Association Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 56-4001 et seq. Because there were pending claims against the insurers, the Commissioner notified the Association that it was required to satisfy the claims. The Association filed its actions against appellees seeking a declaration that the Commissioner's action in holding the Association liable for payment of claims arising prior to July 1, 1971, constituted an unconstitutional retroactive application of the Act. The trial court entered judgment in favor of appellees, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The Act did not limit insolvent insurers to insurers licensed to do business after July 1, 1971. Rather, the Act defined insolvent insurers to include any insurer licensed to do business either when it issued the policy upon which a claim was based or when the insured event occurred.

After the trial court upheld the ordinances' validity, review was sought. Upon review, the court held that the ordinances were properly enacted pursuant to Tenn.

The court also held that the annexation statutes, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 6-309, 6-310, were not violative of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments because the extension of corporate limits to include additional territory was in no sense an impairment of an owner's liberty, nor was it a taking of private property for public use. Furthermore, in rejecting the contention that the annexation statutes violated due process, the court held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-309 required a hearing before annexation. Finally, the court held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-310's classification of industrial areas did not violate equal protection because the classification was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court rejected the contention that &sect; 50-1105 was unconstitutionally vague because it was clear on the face of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 50-1102 through 50-1109 how, when, and where to determine what the actual rate was, when it applied, and what benefits and limitations applied. The court also rejected the contention that recovery was precluded because pre-existing problems and pneumoconiosis were co-mingled. In rejecting this contention, the court held that pursuant to 20 C.F.R. &sect; 410.412, the employees were totally disabled due solely to pneumoconiosis. In reversing, the court held that the &quot;second injury fund&quot; was inapplicable because pneumoconiosis was not an &quot;injury&quot; under Tenn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A black ambulance owner and operator recovered a judgment against the city officials in a federal action alleging a violation of his civil rights. The General Assembly of Tennessee enacted 1972 Tenn. Priv. Acts 266 and 415 to permit the city to indemnify the city officials from judgments resulting from illegal acts committed in the performance of their official duties. The city officials satisfied the judgment against them out of personal funds, then requested reimbursement from the city. The city treasurer declined the reimbursements because a federal action questioning the constitutionality of the Private Acts, filed by the resident, was pending. The city officials filed a declaratory judgment action and the trial court held that the city was obligated to reimburse the city officials. On appeal, the court affirmed. A finding that the city officials had not acted with good faith as to enable them to assert a defense under the qualified governmental immunity doctrine was not per se a finding of &quot;willful wrongdoing&quot; for purposes of determining an exception under the Private Acts. The record did not reveal the degree of &quot;willfulness&quot; that barred indemnification of the city officials.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After four attempts, the examinee failed to pass the Tennessee bar examination.

Code Ann. &sect; 4-1902. The court first held that it had the inherent and original power to prescribe court rules, and thus it had original jurisdiction to review a Board action interpreting and applying those rules. The court held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-1902, as amended by 1972 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 789, did not render Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 37, &sect; 7 null and void. The court also held that a legislative enactment purporting to delete a requirement established by a Tennessee Supreme Court rule regarding the admission of attorneys to practice was an invalid encroachment on the inherent power of the judiciary. The examinee conceded the courts' inherent right to determine who could to practice before them, but argued that the statute did not encroach on that authority. Citing Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 1, 2, the court held that the 1972 statutory amendment was in direct conflict with Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 37, &sect; 7 and was therefore unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the ordinance was not invalid because of a variance in the description of the area as found in the third reading of the ordinance and its final description because the change merely corrected a clerical error. The court also found that it was beyond dispute that the property would not experience discrimination as a result of the annexation. The court held that the annexation of territory was a legislative matter that could be disturbed only if the action was arbitrary and unreasonable. If the reasonableness of the annexation was debatable, then the annexation would be upheld. It was evident that a debatable question existed as to whether the annexation would benefit the community. Therefore the annexation had to be upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issue was whether defendant had been unconstitutionally placed in jeopardy twice for the same offense. Both the prowling conviction in the city court and the subsequent state conviction for the attempt to commit a felony were based on the same act. Basically, the question was whether defendant's conviction and the imposition of a two dollar fine for &quot;prowling&quot; in violation of the city ordinance barred a subsequent indictment upon the state charge of attempting to break and enter a motel with the intent to steal. The court stated that if the &quot;prowling ordinance&quot; could be construed as constituting an offense or a crime, which it seriously doubted, it certainly was not the same offense as attempting to commit a felony nor a lesser included offense. The court pointed out that the felony charge required criminal intent accompanied with some overt act or acts committed to accomplish that design. The &quot;prowling&quot; ordinance required no such intent and was in reality no more than a restatement of an archaic vagrancy statute. Thus, defendant's right against double jeopardy was not violated and defendant's post conviction relief petition was rightfully denied.</SPAN></P>

The automobile was seized under the Contraband Seizure Act, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 781 et seq., and items from a burglary were found in the automobile's trunk. The court of criminal appeals found that the trial court should have sustained defendant's motion to suppress the items found in his trunk.

A personal injury suit was brought by respondents against petitioner, charging petitioner with negligence, breach of express and implied warranties, tortious misrepresentation, and strict liability in tort. Respondents alleged their car suddenly went out of control because of a defect in the steering mechanism. Motions for summary judgment or dismissal were filed by petitioners. The trial court granted the motions. The lower appellate court affirmed the dismissal of a breach of warranty count, but reversed in all other respects. The court affirmed the lower appellate court's judgment on the warranty counts, but court reversed the lower appellate court on the other counts. It found that the lower appellate court correctly determined that the disclaimer clauses did not violate the provisions of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 2-719(3).

The court found that the title did not give to the legislature and to the public notice of the change that was to be made in increasing the gravity of certain homicides from murder in the second degree to murder in the first degree, in providing for the offense of murder in the first degree when death resulted in certain circumstances from the violation of Tenn.

The intermediate appellate court found that he had a right to the aid of counsel in petitioning the court for a writ of certiorari. The court affirmed. Under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-2018, an indigent defendant was entitled to appointed counsel at trial and also upon appeal. The court reasoned that the statute did not separate appeal into proceedings before the appellate courts. Defendant's rights were violated at that stage of the proceedings at which his court-appointed attorney should have advised him of his additional avenues of appeal and of the action planned in the case.

The trial court declared &sect; 40-2903 unconstitutional and granted the inmate's petition for a suspended sentence. The appellate court reversed. On certiorari, the court reversed the trial court, dismissed the petition, and remanded. The court held that the inmate was not barred from raising the issue in an action for declaratory judgment. The court found that the inmate had standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 40-2903. The court opined that the legislature did not act arbitrarily in prohibiting trial courts from suspending sentences once an inmate began to serve the sentence or in prohibiting courts from suspending sentences of more than five years. The court found that the statutory scheme did not deny due process of law and it did not offend the Equal Protection Clause because the cut off point could result in some inequity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was injured while riding as a guest passenger in the owner's automobile which the driver was operating. The victim was 19 years of age at the time of the accident in 1970. On review, he argued that the statute of limitations did not run until his 22nd birthday. The court affirmed the dismissal. The court construed the Legal Responsibility Act of 1971 (Act), 1971 Tenn. Pub. Acts 162, as removing the disabilities of minority of all persons 18 to 21 years of age as of the effective date of the statute in 1971. From and after that date all persons reached their majority at age 18. The victim's argument that his disability of minority was retroactively removed on his 18th birthday was without merit. The Act was not a statute of limitation, although its effect shortened the period within which minors could commence actions. The court concluded that the victim had the full year following the effective date of the statute within which to bring his personal injury action resulting from the accident and failed to do so.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied petitioner's application for habeas corpus relief. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 40-1016 was constitutional. The court recognized that the U.S. Supreme Court had held that it was the constitutional and statutory duty of a governor of a state where a fugitive was found to cause him to be arrested, surrendered, and delivered to the appointed agent of the demanding state. The court reasoned that the governor's function in issuing the warrant was executive in nature. The extradition proceedings were summary, rather than a judicial proceeding that inquired into the merits of the charge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation was a contractor engaged in the construction of roads and highways for the State of Tennessee. The corporation purchased the raw materials for the asphalt it used in road construction and made the asphalt itself. The corporation paid sales tax on the raw materials for the asphalt. The Commissioner collected from the corporation the use tax on the cost of producing the asphalt. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the provision of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-3400 that exempted from the use tax tangible personal property that was fabricated, erected, or applied by a contractor or subcontractor and that became part of a building did not apply to asphalt that became part of a road. The court approved the chancery court's conclusions that the State was not subject to estoppel in the collection of taxes and that the collection of the use tax did not constitute double taxation or an unconstitutional classification in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. The court affirmed the chancery court's determination that the corporation was liable for the entire amount collected where the corporation failed to raise the issue of the amount collected in its pleadings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were divorced. By virtue of the divorce decree, the husband was required to pay child support until one of the parties two children reached the age of majority. At that time the husband's support obligations decreased by 50 percent. The age of majority was 21 when the divorce decree was entered. The husband began to pay only half of the amount that he had been ordered to pay, contending that the passage of 1971 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 162, which reduced the age a person reaches his or her majority from 21 years to 18 years, meant that he did not have to make payments on behalf of the child that had turned 18. The trial court dismissed the wife's petition for awrit of scire facias. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. First, 1971 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 162 was not invalid as impairing the obligations of a contract because the divorce decree was not a contract. Second, the trial court's authority to order the husband to make payments in support of his children was by virtue of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 36-820, 36-828. The trial court's authority only extended to that period when the husband was required by law to support his children, which was during their minority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent was a fireman for the city. The city had a life and accident insurance policy with defendant insurer covering members of the fire department. Prior to decedent's commencement of work, he underwent a physical examination and it failed to reveal any evidence of lung cancer, from which he subsequently died. After his death, plaintiff widow made a claim with defendant for death benefits, but defendant denied liability and refused to pay. Plaintiff then filed suit to recover under the group policy. The trial court rendered judgment for plaintiff for the policy amount, plus a 25 percent penalty, holding that defendant acted in bad faith. Defendant's motion for a new trial was overruled, and it appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment in favor of plaintiff, holding that defendant failed to rebut the presumption that decedent's death was a loss in the line of duty, was in the line and course of employment, and was in the actual discharge of the duties of his position. The court modified the judgment; however, it eliminated the sum awarded as a penalty because it held that defendant did not act in bad faith.</SPAN></P>

Pub. Acts ch. 163, codified at Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 52-1409 to 52-1448, known as the Tennessee Drug Control Law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Criminal Appeals transferred defendants' appeal to the court because their sole issue was the constitutionality of 1971 Tenn. Pub. Acts. ch. 163. Defendants were represented by counsel at trial, but perfected their appeal pro se. The court rejected defendants' first argument that the statute unconstitutionally interfered with the free exercise of their religious beliefs. While laws could not interfere with mere religious beliefs and opinions, they could restrict practices in the interest of maintaining the peace, order, and morals of society. The court summarily rejected defendants' argument that the statute violated U.S. Const. amend. IX. Nor did the statute's prescription of sentences and fines violate the Eighth Amendment's proscription on cruel and unusual punishment. Finally, the court disagreed that classifying marihuana with addictive and disabling drugs was irrational; not reasonably related to public health, safety, and morals; too broad; and violative of equal protection and due process rights. The legislature was presumed to have exercised sound discretion in enacting the criminal statute, and in this instance it acted in the exercise of its police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1950, almost 20 years prior to working for the employer, the claimant had sustained a compensable injury while working for a different company. Subsequently, the claimant was awarded total and permanent disability benefits because of lung disease of coal workers, pneumoconiosis, contracted in 1970, while working for the employer. The employer assigned as error the failure of the trial court to give credit to the employer for the disability previously awarded to the claimant. By this assignment the employer sought to have a provision of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 50-1007 applied so as to allow it credit for a 60 percent permanent partial disability referable to the body as a whole, paid by the former employer pursuant to the Workmen's Compensation Law. The trial court denied the employer's asserted construction of &sect; 50-1007, and on appeal, the court concurred. The court reasoned that holding the employer of a claimant injured in 1970 shall have credit on the 1970 recovery based on the percent of disability that occurred in 1950, was so patently and grossly unfair that it would not charge that intention to the legislature.</SPAN></P>

On defendant's appeal, the court reversed the decision of the trial court and dismissed the case. The court determined that &sect; 59-1204 did not provide for a hearing prior to the revocation of the driver's license, that the United States Supreme Court had determined in a case involving a similar statute that due process required an individual's license and registration not be suspended or revoked prior to a hearing for liability, if any, as a result of the accident, that defendant's conviction occurred after the Supreme Court ruling so retroactivity was not involved, and that the issue of constitutionality could be raised at any time, as an exception to Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the certiorari appeal was under advisement, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the imposition and carrying out of the death penalty in two cases involving convictions in other states constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The governor then commuted the death sentence to 99 years in prison. The court found that the death penalty was lawfully imposed in accordance with the laws existing at the time of trial and that the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions did not immediately void defendant's death sentence. It held that the commutation order transformed the original judgment of conviction to one for 99 years as though the original judgment had not been granted without regard to whether or not defendant accepted or consented to the commutation. As the unconstitutional part of the original sentence was removed, the court held that the judgment, as commuted, was valid and enforceable with no change in the original judgment.</SPAN></P>

The city argued that the Act was a taxation statute rather than an annexation statute and that &sect; 9 did not apply. The trial court declared the Act to be constitutional. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the Act was not a general act because it effected only the city and that the Act was an annexation statute because the right under the Act to annex territory without taxing for services other than those actually rendered was a distinct and new municipal power regarding annexation of adjacent territory. Thus, &sect; 9 did apply to prohibit the legislature from prescribing any method of altering municipal boundaries except by general law. Accordingly, the Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 39-2017, as amended by 1971 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 167. The criminal court held that the criminal lottery statute violated due process because it was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with participating in and soliciting others for affiliation in a group, the membership of which was increased through a chain process. New members secured other members and thereby advanced to a position where each member in turn received fees from other members. The group was represented as a motivational course consisting of educational media and training. Members represented to potential new members that they could advance themselves and earn commission fees by securing other new members. The indictment charged defendants with operating a lottery in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2017, as amended by 1971 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 167. Defense counsel argued that the words &quot;group,&quot; &quot;members,&quot; and &quot;advance themselves in a group&quot; were so vague and incapable of precise definition as to render the statute constitutionally infirm. The trial court found that the statute was vague and overbroad in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.On appeal, the court disagreed and reversed, finding no violation of the constitutional principle that no person should be criminally liable for conduct he could not reasonably understand was proscribed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff worked for the county until the judge refused to make further payments under 1951 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 134. The sheriff then filed a mandamus action against the judge in an effort to recover compensation allowed under the Act. The trial court granted the judge's motion to dismiss. On review, the judge argued that the Act was unconstitutional because it provided the sheriff payment for performance of ex officio services in a manner different from that authorized by law. The court found that the duties that were required of the sheriff under the Act only applied to sheriff's of the specific county at issue. The court concluded that the duties imposed under the Act on the sheriff were not required of other sheriffs and, therefore, were not ex officio duties. The court held that the Act's provision for compensation of the performance of such duties was not in contravention of the general law that gave the county court authority to compensate the sheriff.

Defendant entered a plea of not guilty and filed a motion to quash the indictment on the ground that &sect; 39-1957 was unconstitutional. The State sought review from the judgment granting the motion, which the court reversed. The court found that the gravamen of the crime denounced by the statute was the fraudulent intent of disposing or concealing consumer goods or equipment that were subject to a security interest, with the intent to deprive the secured party of same, or any part thereof, or of the proceeds, or any part thereof. The objectionable paragraph of the statute provided that if the person so disposing of the property paid the debt to secure that which the security agreement was executed before he was arraigned for trial, he could not be held liable. If the court held the paragraph unconstitutional, it would not destroy the entire statute because the balance of the statute was capable of being enforced in accordance with the apparent legislative intent.

The chancellor and the court of appeals agreed that nothing objectionable resulted from the conduct which the inspector had forbidden, but both found that the inspector and the board acted lawfully in forbidding such activity. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that application of &sect; 11-2003(b) discriminated unfairly and unlawfully in its application to one of the lots occupied by the business owners. The court therefore decreed that the section was void in its application to such use of the property. According to the court, the business owners' use of the property did not cause any result justifying the exercise of the police power under the municipality's zoning authority.</SPAN></P>

Pub. Acts 275, which amended Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 45-2006, was unconstitutional as an unreasonable exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies sought to have decreed invalid as violative of both the State and Federal Constitutions, 1969 Tenn. Pub. Acts 275 (Act), which amended Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 45-2006 to prohibit the use of the words &quot;savings and loan&quot; in the companies' corporate titles unless certain other requirements were met. The companies sought temporary and permanent, injunctive relief and a declaratory decree declaring the Act unconstitutional as it deprived them of a valuable property right. The trial court dismissed the bill. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the Act was not an unreasonable exercise of police power in that it distinguished corporations owned under the Loan and Thrift Act from those with similar names and which were insured by an agency of the federal government. The statute did not deny the companies' rights to use their corporate names but only required that they add the words &quot;not federally insured&quot; to advertisements in which their names were used. The companies did not have a contract right in their charters to use &quot;savings and loan&quot; such that it would defeat the exercise of the legislature's police power. All other assignments of error were overruled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers filed an action to recover taxes paid under protest on the recordation of continuation statements. The court affirmed the dismissal of the bill finding that Item S(b) applied to the filings of continuation statements as contemplated by Tenn. Code. Ann. &sect; 47-9-403(3) and was constitutional as so applied. A continuation statement was subject to taxation as an &quot;evidence of indebtedness&quot; where it evidenced the extension of credit for an additional five years beyond a financing statement and required recordation to be effective. The tax was applicable even though the continuing security interest may have fluctuated over a period of financing because the indebtedness was ascertainable at any given time. The tax statute was not drafted so as to permit double taxation upon the same event where, although continuation statements and financing statements were similar, recordation of each was a separate event entitled to separate taxation. The tax statute was not void for vagueness because it specifically defined the classes of instruments to which the privilege tax was applicable and made clear and definite provision for the ascertainment of the base of the tax.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that the ordinance, enacted under statutory authority, fell squarely within the legitimate use of the city's police power because it sought to protect the health and safety of the community in requiring removal of hazardous dwellings. In addition, the court rejected the owner's argument that even if the ordinance was constitutional, the factual findings did not support removal of his dwellings because four were shown to be fire hazards due to inadequate electrical wiring and one was in a very dilapidated condition.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the evidence supported the ex-wife's allegations. However, the trial court found that the equities in all the properties of the parties should be divided equally, including the equity in the real property. The ex-wife appealed. The appeals court, without discussing Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-825, held that the requirement of Tenn.

Code Ann. &sect; 36-825 gave the trial court the authority to divide the property equitably despite the homestead statute. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment because Tenn.

The chancellor held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-1946 was not void as a partial law, but that it was unconstitutional as arbitrary and capricious class legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court clerk refused to issue the fortune-teller a license to practice her profession in Shelby County. She brought a declaratory judgment action to have Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-1946 declared unconstitutional and void. The chancellor found that the statute was not void, but that it was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that there was no reason to only prohibit the practice of the profession of a fortune-teller in counties with a population greater than 400,000 persons according to the 1950 census. Though Shelby County was the only Tennessee county whose population exceeded 400,000 in 1950, the court interpreted the &quot;and&quot; in the statute as &quot;or&quot; and allowed either the federal census of 1950 or any subsequent federal census to determine the population classification. Therefore, Shelby was not necessarily the only county that could ever be affected by the statute. However, the court could not discern any reason to confer the immunity from fortune-tellers upon the residents of the most populous urban county of the state. The court concluded the classification was arbitrary. There was no reasonable relationship between population and whatever evils accompanied fortune telling.</SPAN></P>

The punishment was not limited to a small fine. The issue was whether the legislature could authorize a county to declare conduct that was valid in other counties to be criminal in its own county. By this process, the county could circumvent not only the rule against delegation of powers peculiarly the province of the legislature, that of creating crimes, but also circumvent the requirements of Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, which was that the law of the land had to be general. In affirming the decision, the court held that the legislature could not delegate to a county authority to declare maintaining an automobile graveyard a crime when it was not a crime in other counties. While the statute under consideration was aimed at a condition that needed legislative attention, the court could not make bad law resulting in there no longer being any general law of the land as contemplated by Tenn.

The Act did not embrace two subjects, contrary to the demands of Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 17, merely because both health and educational facilities were dealt with. The subject of the Act was the creation of public corporations, with implementation of improvement of health and education being descriptive of the objectives of the corporations. The Act did not provide for the lending of the credit of a municipality to a corporation without a public referendum as required by art. II, &sect; 29. The mortgaging of public property was not the equivalent of the municipality lending its credit to the hospitals.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainant, homeowners in Knox County, brought an action in the Chancery Court at Knoxville (Tennessee) seeking to have declared void the ordinance by which the Knox County Commission zoned 70 acres for uses other than for residences. The chancery court ruled against the homeowners, and because the constitutionality of a statute was a decisive issue in the case, the homeowners were granted an appeal to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners contended that 1967 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 158, which amended 1937 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 183 so as to confer the county's zoning power on the County Commission, was unconstitutional because it violated Tenn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8 and art. 11, &sect; 8. The statute in question established and governed the Knox County Commission. The homeowners insisted that the attempted transfer of the zoning power from the Quarterly County Court to the County Commission was a void attempt to suspend the general zoning law of Tennessee in so far as it affected Knox County. The court held that 1967 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 158 suspended no part either of the substantive or of the procedural provision of the Tennessee's zoning laws; rather what it did, and all that it did, was transfer the authority and the responsibility for the administration of those laws from the Quarterly County Court to the County Commission. The status of the citizenry of Knox County was not affected by the statute. The only change was with respect to the instrumentality selected to administer the law. The constitution contained no restraint upon such legislative action. Therefore, the court held that Chapter 158 was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled the homeowners' assignments of error and affirmed the chancery court's decree.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county constables sought review of a decree of the Chancery Court of Knox County (Tennessee), which found in favor of defendants, various representatives of the state legislature and government, in the constables' declaratory judgment action. The constables had sought to have 1969 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 160 declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The constables argued the state, in establishing the office of constable, continued the office as it existed under the common law; and that the common law duties of preservation of the peace became embodied in the state constitution, and could not have been abridged except by constitutional amendment. Defendants contended that the powers and duties of constable were first fixed by statute, and thus were properly altered by legislative enactment. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decree, which declared that 1969 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 160 was constitutional. The court noted the Constitutional Convention's adoption of North Carolina's statutes concerning constables was conditional. The duties of constables were subject to alteration or repeal by the legislature unless embodied in the constitution, without condition. Constables were never, at any time, invested with implied powers. Depriving of constables of certain statutory powers did not constitute abolishment of a constitutional office because the office of constable was still in existence, and still retained certain of its substantive functions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from a trial court of Davidson County (Tennessee), which convicted him of the operation of a motorcycle without a protective helmet in Metropolitan Nashville, a violation of Nashville, Tenn., Metropolitan Ordinance No. 67-255, &sect; 16. Defendant asserted that &sect; 16 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 16 caused defendant's violation of the crash helmet law, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 59-934, to constitute a municipal misdemeanor. Defendant was charged, convicted, and appealed. Defendant asserted that &sect; 59-934 and the ordinance were invalid exercises of State police power because the helmet requirement related only to the safety of the motorcycle operator, not the public. The court rejected defendant's contention that police power was deprived from the maxim that a citizen was entitled to enjoy his property in so far as he harmed no others. The police power was based on the maxim which stated that regard for the public welfare was the highest law. The public was subject to harm if a motorcycle operator lost control or crashed due to his failure to wear a helmet. Additionally, an operator's failure to wear a helmet could result in the operator becoming a public ward, if he was seriously injured. Defendant had no protectable privacy interest in the operation of a motorcycle without a helmet because it was an activity that took place primarily on public roads. Section 59-934 was adequate to give notice of the type of protective helmet required and was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 47-11-104, which permitted the agreement, was unconstitutional in that Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 7, provides that the legislature could not provide for a conventional rate of interest in excess of 10 percent per annum. The chancellor sustained the store's demurrer and dismissed the action. On appeal, the court affirmed. To be successful the customer was required to show that &quot;interest&quot; included the price increase charged for credit sales. However, at the time of the adoption of the Tennessee Constitution, the technical legal meaning of &quot;interest&quot; was limited to the price paid for the loan of money or the forbearance of debt. The sale of merchandise, either personal property or land, was not usurious when the sale was made for one price if cash is paid and for a higher price if payment was deferred or if payment was made in future installments.</SPAN></P>

The register of deeds amended his petition to charge that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8-2409 was void by virtue of violation of Tenn. Const. art I, &sect; 8 and Tenn.

The city brought a declaratory judgment action, seeking a determination that &sect; 6-640 was unconstitutional because it discriminatorily gave preferred status to police and fire officials over other city employees. The chancery court declared the statute constitutional; and on appeal, the court affirmed, holding that: 1) because the potential liability of police and fire officials is greater than other groups of employees, the statute was a classification based on a reasonable and natural difference between groups of employees, and as such is not unconstitutional; 2) as a fringe benefit to encourage new and regular fire and police employees, &sect; 6-640 served a public purpose despite the fact that the individuals benefited; and 3) the insurance provisions of the statute were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The State brought an action against the guardian of the patient's estate to recover from the patient's estate for payment of the patient's treatment and care provided by the State's mental hospitals. The trial court ruled in favor of the State, finding that the patient was a private-pay patient and not a poor person as defined by statutory law. Thus, he was not entitled to his hospitalized confinement at the expense of the State, and the State was entitled to reimbursement. Both parties appealed. The guardian claimed that the State's attempt to recover from the patient's estate for the cost and care rendered to the patient violated the Tennessee Constitution, which prohibited forfeitures of an estate to the sovereign for the conviction of a crime. The court ruled that the State's attempt to recover from the patient's estate did not violate the Tennessee Constitution because the patient was charged with a crime but was never convicted.

Several defendants were sentenced to 99 years in the state penitentiary, and the remaining defendants were sentenced to death by electrocution. The court affirmed the judgments, having examined the allegations of prejudice resulting from the joint trial and finding that they did not evidence an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge in refusing to grant the requested severance. Defendants had the benefit of a fair and impartial jury, and the evidence did not preponderate against the verdict of the jury. There was no reason that compelled the trial judge to order the attorney general to provide defendants with the prior statements and notes of witnesses, who were cross-examined by defendants. The record indicated no specific evidences of passion, prejudice, or caprice. The trial judge properly conducted the trial and insured defendants' rights to a fair trial. The jury's task was a difficult one, but there was no reason for the court to quarrel with the verdicts.</SPAN></P>

Defendant moved for a new trial, which was denied. Defendant appealed, alleging that the bad check law, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-1959 et seq., was unconstitutional because it was vague, indefinite, and ambiguous, and the presumption of intent to defraud and of insufficient funds created under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-1960 established a rule of evidence, which denied defendant of his right to due process of law. Upon the State's motion, the appellate court transferred the case to the court because the only issue involved was a constitutional question. The court ruled that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-1959 et seq. was constitutional where the legal presumption in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-1960 clearly created only a rebuttable presumption that certain facts established a prima facie case of intent to defraud and knowledge of insufficient funds, and it did not displace the presumption of defendant's innocence at trial or relieve the State of its burden to prove defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The bill sought a determination of whether 1967 Tenn. Pub. Acts 325, by implication, repealed 1967 Tenn. Pub. Acts 312, or alternatively, whether Chapter 312 violated the state constitution. The companies and the officials demurred to the bill. The trial court overruled the demurrers. On appeal, the court found that the enactments had affected change in the previously fixed basis of biennial assessment for ad valorem taxes of real property within the state. The court determined that the enactments were similar and held that there was not need for both statutes. The court found that the legislature had the authority to direct the manner and mode of the ascertainment of the value of real property for taxation. However, the court found that Chapter 312 did violate the state Constitution because it worked a postponement of the inclusion of increased value for real property tax assessments. Therefore, the court upheld the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trial court enjoined the utility from further construction of facilities in the annexed area.

It said that the co-op had refused its offer to pay for the co-op's property in the annexed areas. After oral argument, the trial court dissolved the injunction, holding only the franchised utility could serve the annexed areas. The appellate court upheld dissolution of the injunction, but said the co-op could compete with the utility in the annexed areas. The court disagreed and held that under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-318, only the franchisee utility could furnish electricity within the city, even though the co-op had been serving the area before annexation. Unlike in previous annexations, the co-op had refused the utility's offer of compensation, in this case, an amount above the actual value of the co-op's facilities.

He was sentenced to serve 10 years for each conviction, with the sentences to run consecutively. His petition challenged the conviction from which the first sentence issued but not the other. The State argued that the petition was premature because the time under which the prisoner could be legally detained had not expired. The trial court agreed and dismissed the petition, and the court of appeals affirmed. On a grant of certiorari, the prisoner argued that the trial court erred in allowing proof of authority to detain by reference to the minutes and that the conviction under the second indictment did not prevent consideration of the validity of the other conviction. The court remanded the case and determined that the State, by using the minutes as proof of authority, failed to comply with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 23-1823, which required a copy of the written authority to hold the prisoner. The court found, however, that the prisoner's petition was premature. Under a plain reading of Tenn.

The chancellor held that the bill seeking recovery of the franchise and excise taxes was dismissed but that the company was entitled to recovery of the penalties paid thereon. The company appealed, and the court held that the company had not qualified to do business in the state but had carried on its business activities within the state in corporate form, and thus was taxable under Tenn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was indicted for larceny and receiving stolen property. He moved to waive his right to a jury trial and submit his case to the trial judge, as to both guilt and punishment pursuant to &sect; 40-2504. The State concurred in the motion. The trial court granted the motion and the inmate entered a plea of guilty, which was accepted by the trial court, and the inmate was sentenced consecutive terms of one and three years in the county penal farm. Subsequently, the inmate petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 40-2504. The trial court dismissed the inmate's petition finding that &sect; 40-2504 was constitutional. The inmate appealed. The court affirmed and ruled that the trial court did not err in dismissing the inmate's petition challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 40-2504, which allowed waiver of trial by jury where the state and federal constitutions were silent as to the right to waive trial by jury, and the record showed that the inmate knowingly, intelligently, and with advice as to his right to a jury trial, waived the same, which was concurred by his counsel and approved by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor was burned by uninsulated power lines while flying a kite from the power company's electrical transformer, which was located in a vacant lot. The transformer was built several feet above the ground, but children could climb up to it. The jury rendered a verdict in favor of the minor and his mother in their action against the power company. The appellate court reversed and remanded for new trial on the ground that the trial court improperly excluded evidence of the power company's compliance with the National Electrical Safety Code. The court reversed and reinstated the judgment in favor of the minor and his mother. The court held that the Code rules regulating the height of the platform and the uninsulated transmission lines were designed solely to protect a person on the ground and had no applicability to one on the transformer platform. The evidence with respect to the Code was thus irrelevant and immaterial to the playground issue, which was the basis of the minor's claim. The result at trial was the correct one because admission of the excluded evidence would not have changed the outcome. Therefore, under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 27-117, the judgment was not reversible.</SPAN></P>

On appeal from his conviction, defendant contended, among other things, that the rifle was improperly admitted into evidence because it was obtained by an illegal search and seizure. Defendant also alleged that the trial court erred in failing to grant him a severance from his co-defendant. The court held that the rifle was properly admitted into evidence; there was no search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution because the rifle was plainly visible to the officer. The court also held that the trial court did not err in failing to grant a severance upon its own motion; defendant never made a motion for a severance, and there was no showing that defendant was denied a fair trial.

In affirming, the court held that even though 1965 Tenn. Pub.

The court held that &sect;&sect; 39-3005, 39-3006 and 39-3007 were valid under the United States and Tennessee Constitutions and was not applied in an unconstitutional manner. They had adequate procedural safeguards to properly protect against constitutionality protected expression. It could be found that one of the State's witnesses had knowledge of the national standards of decency. The trial court could have found that the local standards of decency were essentially the same as the national standard. When it was shown that the local standards were essentially the same as the national standards, then it was not error to qualify a witness relative to local standards. Insofar as the injunction applied to &quot;any other film or trailer,&quot; it was in error. However, the error was harmless. The court found that the film was devoid of any literary, scientific, or artistic value and was utterly without social importance. Considered as a whole, it was not only predominantly appealed to the prurient interest, but it had no other possible appeal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the petition and defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in holding that the a judicial principle related to the use of evidence of prior convictions applied to convictions which became final before the rendition of the opinion from which the principle was expressed. The court ruled that courts must determine retroactivity in each case by looking to the peculiar traits of the specific rule in question. Further, the court held that retroactivity or nonretroactivity of a rule was not automatically determined by the provision of the Constitution on which the dictate was based. The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that the announced rule was to preserve the integrity of the judicial system, and to prevent a jury from becoming prejudiced, and was not to advance such a rule by retroactive application.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the application of Tenn.

The court held that the injunction was unconstitutional and reversed the decree to the extent that it enjoined the showing of future films. The statute comprehended only specific, or obscene, material. The petition for the injunction had to clearly identify the material. Further the trial court could not enjoin the display of unidentified films or coming attractions which might be obscene because courts did not have unlimited power of prior restraint on the freedom of speech and press. The district attorney, not defendants, had the burden of proving that the material was obscene. The court affirmed the decree in that it enjoined defendants from showing a certain film because it was obscene. That portion of the decree was supported by competent and material evidence.</SPAN></P>

The police took his operator's license. In municipal court the driver was found guilty, but was found not guilty by the criminal court, which restored his license. While the driver's case was pending in the criminal court, he brought this action in the trial court alleging, among other things, that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 59-713(d) was unconstitutional and appealed from the holding that the statute was constitutional. The court affirmed the judgment. Because the driver's license had been restored by the criminal court in the interim, the court concluded that this action was moot and should be dismissed. The court nevertheless went on to point out that neither Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 59-713(b) or (f) had been repealed or modified, as alleged by the driver's counsel, just because they were not restated in the statutory supplement and that the driver's ground for arguing that the statute was unconstitutional was therefore erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed with the lower court that the police officer had a right to appeal his transfer for a hearing before the Board and noted that an ex parte hearing had been held without notice to the police officer or his counsel wherein the complaining witness against the police officer was interrogated and a wound on his head examined. The court held that under the provisions of the city charter, the police officer had a right to a hearing and to be present in person or by counsel, that this meant that no evidence could be adduced against him outside of this hearing, and that the fact there was substantial evidence introduced at the regular hearing to support the Board's ruling was immaterial. Even though the police officer would escape punishment, if guilty, for his alleged misconduct, the court found that it had to weigh whether failure of justice in the case was a greater or lesser evil than doing violence to the cherished judicial tradition embodying the basic concepts of fair play. Because the choice has to be made, the court concluded that the failure of justice in the one case at bar was the lesser evil.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporations planned on developing a planetarium and space museum. Both corporations had extensive negotiations with the bond purchaser. The bond purchaser agreed to purchase revenue bonds if the legislature enacted an amendment to the Industrial Act whereby planetariums would be included under the definition of project. The Act was amended but the bond purchaser refused to purchase the bonds or make any binding commitment because it asserted that the amendment was unconstitutional. The bond purchaser filed a demurrer to the corporations' action. On appeal the court first held that the bill did in fact state a cause of action. Both the corporations and the bond purchaser had a real and material interest in the declaration sought. The court noted that the only real constitutional question raised by the demurrer was whether the financing of the planetarium was for a public purpose. The court determined that the amendment met all the requirements of Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 17. Finally, the court concluded that the development of the planetarium was to promote industry and develop trade and the purposes of the project were &quot;public&quot; in all respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Criminal Court of Hamilton County (Tennessee), which convicted him of unlawfully and feloniously having in his possession explosives without having met the mandate of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-1405 through 39-1410 relating to the possession of explosives and without having complied with the regulations of the State Fire Marshal. The criminal court then overruled defendant's motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before his trial defendant made a motion to quash the indictment, which was overruled. On appeal defendant first argued that the criminal court erred in not sustaining the motion to quash the indictment. Specifically, defendant contended that the statutes under which he was convicted were unconstitutional and that the indictment failed to aver that he had explosives for the purpose of committing an illegal act. The court noted that the indictment did not explicitly contain any charge of intent to use the explosives for an unlawful purpose. Such charge was only implicit. Because the criminal court's general jury instructions made no pointed reference with respect to submitting the question to the jury that possession of explosives was for the purpose of committing an illegal act, defendant submitted a special instruction, which was refused. The court concluded that the requested instruction should have been given because no sinister or unlawful conduct other than simple possession of the explosives was charged by the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the criminal court's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state election officials and three intervenors appealed from a decree of the Chancery Court of Davidson County (Tennessee) that granted appellee citizens' request for a declaratory judgment. The officials challenged the trial court's finding that Tenn. Const. art. 2, &sect; 6 forbade the division of counties in forming senatorial districts and, therefore, conflicted with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 3-102.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against the state election officials and three intervenors. The thrust of the action was that the portion of the legislation regarding the apportionment of senators was unconstitutional because it violated Tenn. Const. art. 2, &sect; 6. Specifically, the issue was whether the provisions of &sect; 2, ch. 3, Acts of the Extraordinary Sessions of 1965, which subdivided counties entitled to two or more senators into geographically separate senatorial districts, so as to permit the population of a geographical segment of a county to elect a senator, but to prevent them from voting upon other senators elected from other geographical segments of the same county, violated &sect; 6. The trial court granted the citizens' request for declaratory relief. The court affirmed because &sect; 6 unambiguously forbade the division of counties in forming senatorial districts; and therefore Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 3-102 was in conflict with &sect; 6. A construction of the constitution adopted by the legislature and long accepted by the people was entitled to great weight and will be accepted as a correct interpretation unless some palpable error is shown.</SPAN></P>

The residents also filed the action against defendant grantors, but the dismissal of the grantors was not challenged on appeal. The court held that the case was concerned with a Public Act, codified in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 13-701 et seq. The court held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 13-703 was mandatory in its requirement that the chief legislative body of a municipality shall hold a public hearing before enacting an amendment to a zoning ordinance. Therefore, the residents had standing to challenge the validity of the amendment under Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business contended that the trial court erred in overruling the business's motion to dismiss at the end of the board's proof for its failure to make out a prima facie case and the trial court erred in holding that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 63-1401 et seq., the statute that created that board, was a valid constitutional amendment. The factual situation in the case, as shown by the various ads, some of them photographs and which were attached as exhibits to the bill, showed beyond question that the business was violating a provision of &sect; 63-1401 et seq. This alone and in itself would be a very sound reason why the trial judge properly used his discretion in granting the injunction. By the enactment of &sect; 63-1401 et seq., the general assembly had obviously found that persons who prepared, adapted, and dispensed eye glasses, spectacles, and the like should be regulated and controlled by a license and that any method of advertisement, which they used was not conducive to maintaining desirable standards and was a reason for revocation of the license. Accordingly, the court affirmed the issuance of the injunction against the business.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the Shelby County Board of Commissioners, brought suit against defendants, the Shelby County Quarterly Court, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief. Specifically, the Board requested that the trial court (Tennessee) declare the rights and status of the parties. The trial court determined that the Board was the executive and administrative body of the county, except when it was otherwise provided by law. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the Board had no right to file the suit in question. The court determined that the Board properly filed the suit for declaratory relief. Defendants then challenged the Board's failure to join other county employees whom it alleged were necessary parties. The court determined that the Board's failure to join such parties who might have been remotely affected by the suit was not fatal. There was a real and existing controversy between the Board and defendants, therefore, the Board's suit was appropriate for judicial determination. The court also rejected defendants' other demurrers to the Board's complaint. The court agreed with the Board that the trial court erred in holding that defendants were authorized to appoint the building commissioner, the electrical inspector, and the plumbing inspector. Therefore, the court modified the trial court's judgment to delete such provisions.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 39-3901. In 1955, by adding an increased punishment for the increased gravity of a robbery by use of a deadly weapon, the Legislature provided for increased punishment of such an offender. Simple robbery and armed robbery were treated as different degrees of the same crime under the same statute. The inmates were not prejudiced in any way by this practice.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 67-2011.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City elected to file the suits under authority of its charter, thus avoiding the provisions of Tenn. Code Ann. tit 67, ch. 20, which prohibited the filing of suits for collection of taxes against a tract of land where suits were already pending against the property for the collection of delinquent taxes under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 67-2003 and 67-2010 through 67-2012, unless the city had exempted itself from the provisions of the statute. The owner contended that the court's decision, if allowed to stand, effectively permitted the legislature to delegate to a municipality legislative authority to exempt itself from a general law. The court found that the city had the right to file the tax suits either under the provisions of Tenn. Code Ann. tit. 67, ch. 20, or under the authority of its charter. Because the city elected to file the suits under authority of its charter, it avoided the provisions of Tenn. Code Ann. tit. 67, ch. 20. The court rejected a case relied upon by the owner as controlling authority. Other points argued were deemed reargument of authorities and facts set forth in the original briefs and thus not subject to consideration pursuant to Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 32.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers filed a bill alleging that the city's ordinance levying a tax on personalty was void because it was amended on the third and final reading contrary to the requirements of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-2026 and also alleging that the assessments were void because they were made on a completely arbitrary and capricious basis. Affirming the chancery court's decree sustaining the city's demurrer, the court ruled that &sect; 6-2026 did not require the passage of a completely new ordinance when only minor changes were made on the third reading and that in the absence of a showing that the amendment made a material difference in the ordinance the court's duty was to presume that the city commissioners acted legally. Rejecting the taxpayers' claim that the ordinance was invalid because it imposed a tax retroactively in contravention of Tenn. Const. art. &sect; 20, the court ruled that the taxing statute did not impair the obligation of a contract or operate to divest rights to any vested interest. The court also ruled that the taxpayers could not attack the legality of the assessments made by the city tax assessor in a court proceeding until they had exhausted their administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>

The owner argued that &sect; 67-2011 prohibited the filing of subsequent suits for the collection of taxes against property where prior suits are still pending against the same property. The City argued that it had passed timely a resolution exempting itself from the provisions of the statute as provided in the last paragraph of &sect; 67-2011. Further, the City argued that the statute was inapplicable because it filed the tax suits under the authority of its charter and not &sect; 2003 et seq.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1963 Tenn. Pub. Acts 368 required the use of state funds to relocate utility facilities as necessitated by the improvement of highways under the Federal Aid Highway Act. The state maintained that the statute was unconstitutional. The trial court ruled in favor of the utilities. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that because utilities were an integral part of the full use of the public right-of-way, the necessary relocation costs resulting from the highway improvement project constituted an integral part of the highway construction cost. The court determined that state funds could properly be spent for the public purpose of constructing and maintaining a public highway. The court concluded that the relocation of the utilities was necessary to allow the public to have a better highway system. The court noted that whatever property rights the utilities may have had, those rights were subject to the lawful and reasonable use of the state's police power.

Ann. &sect; 6-3702, which provided for the consolidation of municipal corporations and counties, the government brought an action seeking a declaration that the Commission improperly granted civil service status to certain county employees and a clarification of the sheriff's relationship to the government. The trial court voided the Commission's action and dismissed the action regarding the sheriff. The government sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court in part. The court found that the trial court properly voided the Commission's action, noting that the Commission had exceeded its authority by granting civil service status to employees not specifically mentioned in its enabling legislation. The court found that the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Tenn., Charter had properly divested the sheriff of his peace-keeping functions and that within certain limitations the sheriff was a government officer bound by the Charter's functional and budgetary provisions.</SPAN></P>

The school system was built as part of the community and was operated under a contract with the Atomic Energy Commission. The chancellor found that the school system was not a part of the public school system during the time it was operated under such contract. Thus, it was not entitled to share in state school funds during that time period. Appellants challenged the validity and application of 1959 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 14, &sect; 17 and sought an alternative writ of mandamus requiring the Commissioner to distribute to appellants their correct allocation of state school funds without regard to the provisions of &sect; 17. The court concurred in the finding of the chancellor that the school system was not a part of the public school system of Tennessee while it was operated under the contract. The county had no control over the operation of the school. Further, a proviso requiring a newly created school system to certify on or before March 1st preceding the pertinent biennium that it had met all requirements for participation in school funds was not vague and indefinite.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge overruled all four motions for a new trial and held that evidence obtained in a search was not competent as to the third and fourth defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each defendant asserted that the principal evidence relied upon by the State was obtained as the result of an unreasonable search and seizure. After hearing testimony outside the presence of the jury, the trial judge held that the search and seizure made at the arrest of the first and second defendants was legal and that the evidence obtained in the search was competent. On appeal, the court noted that the officers entered the first defendant's room at the suggestion of the first defendant. The court held that defendants could have not been harmed by having the jury, in addition to the trial judge, pass upon the legality of the search; thus, the assignments of errors relating to the refusal to give defendants' special requested charge were overruled. The court declined to find that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-908 and 39-909 were unconstitutional. It next held that the evidence was sufficient to support the guilty verdicts as to the first three defendants, as they had brought the burglarious tools with them to a motel, gave false addresses when registering in the motel, and two of them used false names. The proof was not, however, sufficient to show that the fourth defendant was guilty.</SPAN></P>

The Perry County schools, through legislation, then became the special school district. The school board obtained a ruling from the state board of education that the legislation creating the special school district was invalid because it did not comply with the requirements of the state board of education as provided in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 49-233. The special school district filed a declaratory judgment action arguing that &sect; 49-233 was unconstitutional. The chancery court found the statute constitutional. The special school district appealed. Affirming, the court held the statute was not a delegation of legislative power to an administrative body, did not draw its efficacy from a vote, did not allow the state board of education unreasonable authority and was thereby constitutional. In support, the court found that the statute established a basic standard accompanied by a definite and certain policy and was not an improper delegation of legislative power.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed from a judgment of the Criminal Court of Davidson County (Tennessee), which denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The inmate argued that he was denied the equal protection of the law under U.S. Const. amend. XIV because the State laws under which he was sentenced were passed by a legislature that was malapportioned because of its failure to reapportion itself in accordance with the State constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was sentenced to one to five years in the penitentiary, was released on and violated probation, and was again confined. In considering his appeal, the court ruled that the matter was subject to the rules used to justify sustaining the acts done by a malapportioned legislature. The court concluded that the acts of the legislature were those of a de facto body and, as such, they were valid. Also preventing the adoption of the inmate's argument was the rule against chaos and confusion, which provided that a state of chaos and confusion would have resulted from a finding that the laws under which the inmate was sentenced were invalid. Under the third applicable rule, the acts of the legislature were those of a de jure legislature and thus valid. Concluding that the legislature's acts since 1901 were at least those of a de facto body and thus valid, the court balanced the equities between the inmate and the public at large and refused to hold that the legislature's acts were invalid because doing so would have destroyed the State government. The habeas corpus petition, therefore, was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court adopted the chancellor's memorandum opinion. The City contended that the funds, which were appropriated solely to the use of the County school system, should be shared with it based on 1961 Tenn. Pub. Acts 5, &sect; 8(1)(c). The statute required that all school funds for current operation and maintenance purposes collected by the County had to be apportioned by the county trustee among the county, city, and special school districts on the basis of the average daily attendance maintained by each in grades one through 12, during the current school year. The County contended that the statute violated Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 29, because it required the County to divert funds raised by it for county purposes to the City for city purposes. The court held that the statute was constitutional because Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 29, was inapplicable. Public education was a state function. Under the statute, the County had to apportion all the funds, except county transportation funds. Thus, the court rejected the County's contention that funds raised by it for pensions for the retirement of county teachers were not for current operation and maintenance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator was charged with violating a city ordinance. He was tried in the municipal court, found guilty, and fined. He appealed to the circuit court, which found him guilty and affirmed the municipal court's judgment. On appeal, the court held that the prosecution for violation of a city ordinance was a civil, not a criminal, action, which was governed by the rules in civil cases. Therefore, because the case was procedurally a civil case, the Court of Appeals of Tennessee had exclusive jurisdiction of the appeal, under Tenn. Code. Ann. &sect; 16-408. Although the operator did argue that the city ordinance was unconstitutional in denying him a jury trial, that question was not the sole determinative question in the litigation.

On appeal from dismissal of his petition, the inmate argued that use of his first conviction, which was prior to the amendments to the Habitual Criminal Act (Act), Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-2801 to 40-2807, made the statute ex post facto, that he was denied due process when he was indicted as a habitual criminal before he was tried for his fourth felony, and that his grand larceny conviction could not be counted as a prior conviction because it was commuted. The court held that (1) habitual offenders statutes were not ex post facto even where the prior convictions occurred before the effective date of the statute; (2) there was no requirement in the Act that the indictment as an habitual criminal be returned after a fourth conviction, rather, three convictions satisfied the Act; and (3) the commutation of his conviction did not preclude the conviction from being considered as a prior offense under the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were refused admittance to a cafeteria because the cafeteria did not serve members of a minority racial group. Defendants remained at the entrance and entered the vestibule of the cafeteria but were not permitted to enter the main area of the cafeteria. Patrons were unable to leave or enter the cafeteria while defendants occupied the vestibule. After they refused to remove themselves, the police were called, and defendants were escorted away from the scene. Defendants contended that the prosecution was brought for the purpose of enforcement of a rule of segregation or racial exclusion in facilities that were licensed by the state and that were open to the public and that the prosecution was contrary to the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution. The court held that defendants were guilty of misdemeanor offenses because they attempted to correct what they deemed to be an unconstitutional practice on the part of the cafeteria in an illegal manner where their conduct went beyond peaceful demonstrating and picketing. The trial court was authorized to impose a workhouse sentence in addition to a fine.</SPAN></P>

The trial court (Tennessee) reversed the Beer Board decision, and the municipality appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipality enacted an ordinance that limited the number of outlets for the retail sale of beer to seven. All of the retail outlets for the sale of beer were in seven restaurants. The Beer Board denied the applicant's request, and he appealed. The Chancellor felt that so long as the applicant complied with the provisions of the statute, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 57-205, it was mandatory on the Beer Board to grant him a permit. The court disagreed and reversed. A municipality has the right to regulate the granting of permits or licenses to sell beer within the municipality. A city under its police power had the interest of the municipality at heart and knew what interest would best be served by limiting the number of retail outlets for the sale of beer, and that its decision was final and no constitutional right of a rejected applicant for a beer license was infringed upon. The only effect of 1961 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 105 was to give a person who had been denied a permit a right to be heard. This did not though make it mandatory upon the city to grant more permits than its City Fathers deemed advisable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decree was reversed and the ordinance limiting the sale to seven places within the municipality was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and the father were divorced. Pursuant to a decree entered in Michigan, the father was obligated to pay child support. The mother filed a petition in Michigan, claiming that the father was in arrears. The Michigan court found that the father was in arrears, and the cause was certified. Under the Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, the matter came before the trial court in Tennessee. The trial court granted the father's motion to dismiss on the grounds that the Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act was unconstitutional in that it permitted the filing of a petition in a Tennessee court by a non-resident upon a pauper's oath, which was a right not authorized generally by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 20-1629. In reversing the decision and remanding, the court found that the purpose of the Act was to create a simplified, fair, and convenient way to cause those who were obligated to support their children to do so without having to extradite them. Without the privilege of filing such suits on a pauper's oath, the Act would be rendered nugatory because most parties that filed the suit did not have the means to secure the cost of the litigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After certain ad valorem tax assessments were made against them, the corporations appealed the assessments to the state board of equalization, which affirmed the assessments on an apportioned part of the total value of the corporations' property deemed to have a situs in Tennessee for ad valorem tax purposes. The corporations filed a petition with the chancery court, and appellees filed a demurrer, which was sustained. The corporations appealed, and the court found that the corporations were irregular route motor carriers who possessed permits from the state. Appellees argued that this made them liable for the assessments complained of under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 67-901 et seq. The corporations contended that they were being taxed twice on the same property. The court disagreed, finding that the corporations were confusing the incidence of the tax with the measure thereof. The court observed that the taxes in question were imposed at the outset of every biennium upon a carrier's total properties, as apportioned to Tennessee. The court also agreed with appellees' argument that &sect;&sect; 67-901 et seq. were not unconstitutional or void.</SPAN></P>

The court held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-3701 et seq. authorized consolidations. After consolidation, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-3702 stripped county and municipal officers of any powers except those expressly provided. The Charter provisions, adopted under the Metropolitan Act, were constitutional.

Sections 8.166 and 20.06 of the Charter required employees other than the trustee's deputies to be civil service employees and permitted their transfer to the trustee's office.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city, seeking to acquire property for the development of an industrial park, entered into a contract of sale with the sellers. A part of the agreed purchase price was a specified amount in serial interest-bearing bonds that were to be issued by the city under authority of the Act. The sellers refused to perform, however, alleging that the city was not authorized to issue the bonds because the Act was unconstitutional. The court disagreed, held that the Act was constitutional, and affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of the city. The court found that the authority granted to a city under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 13-1304, to either exercise direct control in the development, operation, and maintenance of any industrial park or to delegate such control to a board or commission, was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. Rejecting the sellers' argument that the city lacked authority to exchange bonds for real estate, the court thus concluded that the bonds called for in the contract, when properly issued under the statutes, would be binding and valid obligations against the city.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment. The court found that neither U.S. Const. amend. V or Tenn.

The court found that a valid contract existed in which the consumers agreed to have given the cooperative an easement across their land for the purpose of supplying them with electrical power. The court determined that the consumers had voluntarily became members of the cooperative, and that as valid members they were entitled to have been served by the cooperative, but that they were also obligated to have complied with the reasonable rules and regulations of cooperative. The court opined that the by-law requiring the consumers to have given the cooperative an easement was a reasonable rule, but that in exercising the right given by that by-law, the cooperative had to have acted reasonably and equitably and have constructed the lines so as not to cause undue harm or injury to the consumers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mayor filed an action against defendants to have declared the Act unconstitutional and to enjoin defendants from expending any public funds or holding the elections provided for by the Act. The mayor contended that the apportionment under the Act unreasonably discriminated in favor of voters in sparsely populated rural counties and against him and other voters in densely populated urban counties, by giving the former proportionately more representation than the latter, and thus depriving them of their rights under the Tennessee and federal Constitutions. Defendants denied it was unconstitutional. The chancellor held that the Act was unconstitutional, but refused to enjoin the holding of the election under it. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the chancellor. The court concluded that the chancellor erred in holding the Act unconstitutional and in rendering a declaratory decree to that effect. The Act was merely part of the machinery of the amending process. In passing the Act, the legislature exercised not its legislative power, but its special function in initiating proposed amendments to the constitution.</SPAN></P>

The State abandoned the larceny charge, and the remaining charges were tried together. Defendant was convicted of violating &sect; 45-2216. Defendant appealed, claiming that &sect; 45-2216 was unconstitutional because it denied him equal protection of the law. The court affirmed and ruled that &sect; 45-2216 was constitutional because it was not necessary for laws regulating pawnbrokers to apply equally and uniformly to all citizens in order to be constitutional. It was sufficient that such laws applied equally and uniformly to all who were similarly circumstanced, and that they were not otherwise objectionable.</SPAN></P>

Priv. Acts, ch. 35, &sect; 15 (1953 Act) and 1961 Tenn. Acts ch. 283, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 17-119 (1961 Act), were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The election was challenged by a complaint submitted by the members of the bar. A chancellor sustained the judge's demurrer and held that the 1953 and 1961 Acts were unconstitutional. The 1953 Act included a requirement that judges for the county's general sessions court be licensed attorneys and the 1961 Act required judges of courts with jurisdiction that was concurrent with other courts (including the general sessions court at issue) be authorized to practice law in the state. The court found Tenn. Const. art. 6, &sect; 4, which did not include the requirements that a judge be an attorney in order to serve on the judiciary, was applicable to the Acts in question. The legislature had the constitutional authority to pass laws that prescribed qualifications for judges beyond those specifically set out in that constitutional provision.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A manufacturer of &quot;St. Joseph Aspirin Tablet&quot; sought an injunction, per the Fair Trade Act of Tennessee, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 69-201, et seq., against a retail store that was selling the product at below the manufacturer's recommended price. The trial court found that the act was unconstitutional as violative of the State's police power and denied the application. The court reversed and granted the injunction, holding that the act was not against the State's public policy, but was a legislative enactment fixing the State's public policy on the subject. The court reasoned that fair trade laws, although of comparatively recent origin, were unquestionably the most familiar of legislative methods to control resale price. The United States Supreme Court had established the validity of these provisions as a matter of federal constitutional law. The court concluded that the act's prohibitions equally applied to nonsigners of the contract.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers appealed, and the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the statutory exemption under &sect; 67-3018 contemplated direct sales to the federal government under customary procurement and fiscal procedures and the use of property directly by federal employees. The taxpayers could not be considered &quot;employees&quot; of the federal government; therefore, the exemptions did not apply.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that neither Lake County lower court had jurisdiction of the matter because: (1) Tenn.

The court held that the power to establish new counties was conferred upon the Tennessee Legislature. The acts changing the boundary lines of Lake County were presumed constitutional and had been established for more than 65 years.

The court held that it was reasonably necessary that such authority was given to the Commissioner and when he exercised the proper discretion in granting or refusing that authority, it did not encroach upon the judicial or the legislative branches of the government. The court also held that the purpose of a portion of &sect; 39-1953 was to negate any criminal intent when those violating the statute were members of a bonafide police, judicial, or safety organization; that portion of &sect; 39-1953 had no application to defendants' situation as developed in the record.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that 1961 Tenn. Private Acts ch. 408 applied to every county within the general law authorized to create a metropolitan government. The court found that Tenn. Const. amend. 8 authorized counties to correct certain evils, or undesirable conditions. The court concluded the taxing provisions of the metropolitan government and the urban government did not violate Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 28 where Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 29 empowered the legislature to authorize each county and incorporated town to impose taxes for county and corporation purposes and the metropolitan government was but a consolidation of the two.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a county, its sheriff, and its director of accounts and budgets, appealed from the judgment of the Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee), which overruled the demurrers of defendants in complainant taxpayer's action for declaratory judgment that 1917 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 239, 1951 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 356, and 1951 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 524 applied to the sheriff's office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer alleged that the sheriff's office was required to follow the procedures set forth in the Acts in setting a budget, and that the sheriff had made imprudent expenditures and purchased items at a great cost than if purchased through the commission, as required by the Acts. Defendants claimed that the sheriff's office was controlled by the Anti-fee Bill, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 8-2001-8-2011, 8-2201-8-2221, 8-2401-8-2413. The court reversed the decision overruling the demurrers. The court held that it was clear that the Anti-fee Bill applied to the sheriff in the setting of expenses and salaries and that if the Private Act were also to apply to the sheriff's office, the two would be in conflict. The court held that the Private Acts could not be construed as attempting to control or interfere with the purchases, expenditures, and disbursements which the sheriff had the exclusive right to make under the Anti-fee Bill, but rather that the Private Acts did not apply to constitutional officers -such as the sheriff. The court also held that it was proper to adopt a construction of the Private Acts which would save the Anti-fee Bill rather than invalidate it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Criminal Court of Davidson County (Tennessee), which overruled his motion for a new trial and upheld a jury verdict convicting him of assault and battery on a girl five years of age with the felonious intent to unlawfully sexually molest or fondle her with no intent to carnally know her under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-606 (Supp. 1961).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was in his parked car. One witness testified that a little girl was sitting in defendant's lap, pretending to drive. She stood on defendant's lap, and defendant had his hand on her stomach and thighs. A second witness stated that he observed the little girl &quot;wearing a full dress&quot; in defendant's lap, that he saw defendant put his hand on her chest and stomach, and that defendant put his hand inside the girl's panties. The arresting officer testified that defendant admitted placing his hands on the girl's chest. Over objection, the State questioned defendant as to a previous indictment. The prosecutrix was the parent of a small girl whom he had taken to a movie theater, but the case was eventually &quot;dropped.&quot; Defendant contended that &sect; 39-606 was unconstitutional because it was vague. The court upheld the constitutionality of the statute but reversed defendant's conviction. The act of a male old enough to know right from wrong in placing his hand under a little girl's panties was an act that a normal person unhesitatingly recognized as sexual molesting. However, the evidence presented a jury question, and the testimony as to the indictment was prejudicial and incompetent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While soliciting funds, defendants gave people the impression that the funds would be used for law enforcement. Consequently, defendants were convicted of violating &sect; 39-1953, which made it unlawful to solicit funds under the guise of representing the police. In upholding the convictions, the court held that defendants fraudulently represented that they were connected with a law enforcement body. In so holding, the court noted that people were left with the impression that the funds would go to better law enforcement or were led to believe that payment would put them in a better position if arrested. The court also held that even if testimony regarding defendants' time on the phone was incompetent, it made no difference because there was ample competent evidence to sustain the verdict. Furthermore, in rejecting the contention that the State failed to show that defendants did not come within &sect; 39-1953's exceptions, the court held that the exceptions constituted defenses and that the burden of proof was on defendants. Finally, the court held that &sect; 39-1953 was not unconstitutional class legislation because defendants failed to show that it was directed to anyone in particular.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants' bill further alleged that appellants had requested appellees for the election to be held, that appellees had refused, and that appellants had no redress of their rights and grievances except through the courts. Appellees contended that 1935 Tenn. Private Acts ch. 523 was a valid Act and was within the competence of the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee to enact. On appeal, the court found that Private Acts, which undertook to amend or abrogate a prior general statute in a particular County or class of Counties were unconstitutional. In the action before the court, there was a general law, which provided for the election of a Justice of the Peace in every incorporated town. There was also a Private Act, which was in direct contravention of the general statute and, if held constitutional, would have denied to the citizens of the city the same representation in their County Court as granted to the citizens of other incorporated towns of the State of Tennessee in their County Court. After a most careful and painstaking consideration of all prior decisions of the court construing like or similar acts, the court concluded that the Act was unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

The county contended that the clerk should have accounted for all fees of the circuit, criminal, and sessions courts before he was entitled to ask the county to make up his minimum salary. The trial court ruled in favor of the clerk, holding that the clerk did not have to account for the fees that he had earned as clerk of the sessions court. On appeal, the court found that a portion of Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered the question of whether the saving statute, Tenn.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 23-1423 and 23-1424 within 12 months after the actual taking of possession, but had taken a voluntary non-suit and then re-filed his suit within one year of said non-suit, but more than one year since the taking. The court held that the right to just compensation existed before any relevant statute was ever enacted and that such right could not be said to be created by any statutes, because the latter were enacted in implementation of a constitutional right already given. The court further held that there was no reason why the saving statute should not apply where counsel had misconceived his remedy initially but had filed his petition within the year against the proper defendant; and by reason of the nonsuit the case had not been heard on the merits.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained the demurrer to parts of the petition attacking the ordinance as void on its face and overruled the demurrer as to other parts of the petition raising factual issues as to the reasonableness of the ordinance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, board of education and city, appealed the dismissal by the Chancery Court of Shelby County (Tennessee) of bills filed against the defendants, county, trustee, education board and attorney general, that sought a judgment declaring certain statutory provisions regarding school bond issues invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board and the city independently filed bills that sought judgments invalidating a statutory provision regarding the allocation of school bond funds and a ruling that they were entitled to their proportionate shares of the bond issue proceeds. Defendants demurred. The actions were heard together by the chancery court and the bills were dismissed. Plaintiffs appealed. The court reversed in part on appeal and found that the statutory provision was unconstitutional because it singled out and favored one county in the allocation of school bond funds without a reasonable basis for the disparate treatment. The court also ruled on several of the grounds of defendants' demurrers, which were not addressed by the chancery court and found no merit to claims raising issues of standing and waiver. The court denied plaintiffs' claim for a share of the prior bond issue funds because at the time the bonds were issued, the laws in effect were complied with and presumed to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After enactment of ch. 252, the State demanded the money, plus penalties and interest, from the taxpayer. The taxpayer paid the amount under protest and then brought a lawsuit to recover the amount it had paid as was authorized by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-2305. The taxpayer claimed that the assessment and collection was unjust and illegal on the ground that 1959 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 252 was unconstitutional and void pursuant to Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The trial court agreed. On appeal by the State and the Commissioner, the court held that the right to receive income or earnings was a right belonging to every person, and that this right was not taxable as a privilege. The court noted that the Tennessee Legislature was not entitled to name something to be a taxable privilege unless it was first a privilege. The court ruled that 1959 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 252 itself provided that the tax should not have been construed as a tax on the privilege of carrying on a business in Tennessee, but expressly provided that the tax was upon the privilege of being in receipt of or realizing net earnings in Tennessee, which was an income tax not authorized by Tenn.

The demurrer challenged the constitutionality of a part of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 23-1532, 1959 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 216, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The essential contention on appeal was that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 23-1532 unconstitutionally prohibited any trial until six months after construction of the proposed roadway was completed unless construction was not completed within 24 months. Partly by analogy to a Kentucky case, the court found that the delay provision was unusual and unnatural and held that section unconstitutional only as to the delay language. The court cited a related separability clause as evidence of a legislative intent to have valid parts of the entire condemnation act retain their force if portions were declared unconstitutional. It held that a reasonable delay was not unconstitutional but found that the challenged delay provision was a denial of due process and lacked any factors for determining the reasonableness of the resulting delay. After considering the condemnation act in its entirety and in relation to other condemnation statutes, the court found that the remaining provisions were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to 1909 Tenn. Priv. Acts 339, a board of health for a county was established. In accordance with &sect; 7 of the Act, the board adopted certain regulations requiring immunization against certain diseases. After the board amended its immunization regulations to include poliomyelitis, a public health nurse determined that defendant's two children needed immunization for polio. The children's parents ignored two immunization notices sent home from school. For his refusal to have his children immunized, defendant, the children's father, was indicted for violating the board's regulations requiring the polio immunizations. The jury found defendant guilty of violating the Act for his willful and unlawful failure to refuse to have his children immunized for polio. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction as ample evidence supported the jury's finding that defendant had actual notice of and refused to comply with the constitutional vaccination requirement. The properly captioned Act did not unconstitutionally delegate legislative authority to the county health board, which enjoyed extensive powers to exercise for the protection of the community's health.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the legislature had the authority under the police power to regulate the purchase and sale of motor vehicles for the protection and general welfare of the public. The court further found that the act, as a whole, was not arbitrary or capricious. However, the court held that Tenn.

The objectionable section read that as vacancies occurred, the governor would have filled them from a list approved and certified to him by the State Association of Funeral Directors. By 1959 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 314, the legislature repealed Tenn.

In affirming the decree of the trial court, the court held that it would not have decided a moot question, though it was a question of constitutionality of a statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was the contention of the general sessions judge that 1953 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 224 provided additional compensation for the additional duties and labors imposed on him and that the legislative intent was that both that act and its proceeding acts was to grant an additional sum to his base salary. The court held that it was evident that 1957 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 250 was intended to supersede all prior acts on the question of the salary of the general sessions judge of the county in question and comprised in itself the sole and complete legislation on the subject. Consequently it effected a repeal of all prior acts on that subject. The court held that if the legislature had intended for the amount of $ 6,000 to be in addition to that provided by the 1953 act, it would have been an easy matter for it to have said so.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance sought to annex 2,063 acres of land immediately north of and contiguous to the corporate limits of the city. The court found that as a matter of law the public meeting notice was sufficient to notify the inhabitants. The main issue was whether the ordinance annexing the property was reasonable or unreasonable. The court held that where there was evidence pro and con, it became a question of law for the trial court in view of all of the evidence because it was a fairly debatable question as to reasonableness or unreasonableness. That having been true, the trial court should take the matter away from the jury and concluded in favor of the ordinance. The issue submitted to the jury found that the land was of a greater value than it would have been for ordinary farm purposes. The mere fact that a large percentage of the tract proposed to be annexed consists of agricultural land was not of itself a basis for holding the ordinance annexing the area to be null and void. It was the duty of the trial judge to determine in favor of the action of the legislative body who had passed the ordinance and to decree that the ordinance was a valid ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After he was charged, defendant sought to waive a jury trial, but the request was denied. The evidence at trial showed that police officers observed defendant's car speeding, and when they asked him to follow them to city hall, defendant drove off at high speed. His vehicle ran through two intersections and drove on the wrong side of the road before striking a telephone poll. Shortly thereafter, police found the dead body of defendant's passenger near the vehicle. Defendant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and he appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that the evidence did not preponderate against the verdict and in favor of innocence, and any insufficiency of the arrest warrant was foreclosed by the indictment, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-1605 et seq., which was not itself defective. The refusal to permit defendant to waive a jury was not error because there was no statute authorizing such a waiver in a felony prosecution, even if it was not prohibited by Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 6, 8, or 9. A denial of an appeal from the overruling of a demurrer was not error because the court lacked such interlocutory jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The machine operators contended that the ordinance conflicted with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2033(2), (4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The general law as contained in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2033(2), (4) expressly excluded pinball machines from the definition of gambling or gambling devices. On June 24, 1958, Chattanooga, Tenn., Ordinance 4448 passed, and immediately thereafter all of the machines were confiscated and destroyed that were in the city. The county was not affected and pinball machines were still operated and maintained in the county, and elsewhere throughout the entire state. In holding the ordinance unconstitutional, the court stated that that there was a broad distinction between the exercise of legislative authority when the power of jurisdiction to exercise it had been conferred by law and an attempt to legislate upon matters clearly ultra vires. Where there was power and authority conferred by law to do any legislative act, the discretion of the city could not have been controlled; but, when there was no legislative authority or power, injunction would have been available. A municipal corporation had no discretion to do any act which was clearly illegal and beyond its power. The ordinance was in conflict with the general law of the State.</SPAN></P>

The trial court opined that the legislature would have enacted Chapter 286 if &sect; 3 had been omitted, and therefore elided that section, thus holding that Chapter 286 was valid and constitutional. On appeal, it was argued that Chapter 286 violated Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 9, the Home Rule Amendment, in that it did not require approval of either the local legislative body of the subject county or a majority of the voters of that county; rather, Section 3 required approval of the voters residing within the affected area of that county. In affirming, the court held that a special school district did not come within the definition of a municipality as contemplated in the Home Rule Amendment. Therefore, the Home Rule Amendment was not broad enough to cover special school districts, and the provision as to a referendum was surplusage and properly elided.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 59-1115 violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tenn. Const. art. 11, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 59-1109 provided a gross weight limit of 55,980 pounds for common carriers of freight. The resolution was adopted pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 59-1113 to -1115, -1117, and imposed a 10 ton gross weight limit upon trucks operating on a boulevard and an avenue. Defendants transported loads on the boulevard that exceeded the limit. The trial court correctly held that Tenn.

The resolution prohibited private carriers from using the boulevard while transporting loads in excess of a gross weight limit of 20,000 pounds when common carriers were permitted to carry loads up to 55,980 pounds. The court held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 59-1115's classification unlawfully discriminated between private carriers and common carriers and their classes of vehicles. The court found that in light of the purpose of &sect; 59-1115 to protect roads, no reasonable exception was made for common carriers to carry a load much heavier than private carriers that were not regulated by the Tennessee Public Service Commission and the Interstate Commerce Commission.</SPAN></P>

Acts 101, codified at Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 62-1401 et seq., which regulated the occupation of repairing watches and clocks. The Chancery Court of Davidson County (Tennessee) entered a decree declaring the regulations were unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The watchmaker, who was engaged in the occupation of repairing watches and clocks, and whose continuation therein was sought to be decided by the Board, contended that 1955 Tenn.

XI, &sect; 8, and the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution in that it deprived him of a property right without due process of law. The chancellor agreed and adjudged Chapter 101 unconstitutional. Affirming, the court held that the business of repairing watches was not subject to the regulation under the State's police power. The court held that the requirements of Chapter 101 would have the effect of preventing many would be repairers of watches from entering that old and &quot;innocuous&quot; occupation. Yet, the court was entirely unable to imagine how such requirements at all promoted the general welfare or protected the public morals, health or safety, or had any real tendency to those ends. Thus, Chapter 101was unconstitutional because it could deny some citizens their inherent right to earn their livelihood in a private field of work, thus depriving them of a valuable property right without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner applicant challenged a judgment from the Chancery Court of Hamilton County (Tennessee), which affirmed a board of electrical examiners' refusal to issue him a Class 1 Electrical Contractor's license. Respondents, a mayor and a city's board of commissioners, had previously dismissed the applicant's challenge of the board of examiners' decision to deny his application for a license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A statute, 1933 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 572, authorized the passage of Chattanooga, Tenn., City Code ch. 15 (1949), which created the board of examiners. The applicant alleged that he was qualified to receive a license, that each time he took a examination he passed two of three parts, and that the board of examiners required him to retake them all. The trial court rendered a correct judgment. The trial court correctly found that the board of examiners exercised proper jurisdiction over electrical licensing in an impartial manner. The trial court correctly found no evidence that the board of examiners exceeded its jurisdiction in creating or administering the examination. The court concluded that neither board took any arbitrary or illegal actions with respect to the applicant. The court could not overrule the board of examiners because neither their rules and regulations nor the examination were illegal and arbitrary. The court determined that the exemptions in the statute from the examination that applied to two entities were based on valid classifications. The court decided that the exemptions were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary so as to render the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court upheld the constitutionality of 1957 Tenn. Acts ch. 170 in the Commissioner's suit for a declaratory judgment regarding his rights and duties under ch. 170. The trial court held that the Commissioner lacked authority to maintain the suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company used public rights of way for its facilities for free. Chapter 170 reimbursed utilities for the relocation of their facilities from the rights of way when necessary for the construction of highways. The Commissioner's suit alleged that ch. 170 violated Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 31 by using the State's credit to reimburse or aid corporations and others. The court held that 1957 Tenn. Acts ch. 170 violated Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 31 because the use of the State's credit for reimbursing utilities did not serve a state purpose. The court ruled that the use of the State's credit for reimbursing utilities for removing their facilities from the rights of way was not for a public purpose under Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 29. The court concluded that the Commissioner possessed full authority to institute his suit. The court followed apposite precedent that required utilities to remove, at their expense, their facilities from the rights of way where necessary to improve highways. The court determined that the primary purpose served by the expenditures under 1957 Tenn. Acts ch. 170 could not have been public because it provided appellees with a convenience and benefit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decree. The court remanded the case to the trial court for the entry of any orders or decrees that were necessary to enforce its opinion.</SPAN></P>

The trial court (Tennessee) held that 1955 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 209 was constitutional, that the city's proceedings taken thereunder were for a public purpose, and that the bond issue was valid. The commissioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city agreed to construct a factory building that the city would lease to a private company for a period of 25 years. The building was to be constructed with funds raised by a city bond issue. The bond issue was approved by a three-fourths vote in a referendum election. The commissioner alleged that the bond issue violated the provisions of Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 29 because the bonds would be used to construct a building for a private company. The court held that the bond issue was for a valid public purpose. The city's population had steadily decreased for a number of years. The court took judicial notice of the fact that the city's population would continue to decrease if there were not sufficient industrial jobs available for the city's workers. Inducing industry to locate in the area was a matter of great public concern.

The inmates contended that a federal court and the court in other cases had held that statute was unconstitutional because of an elimination of notice provision that was in violation of due process.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer sought review of a decree of the Chancery Court for Montgomery County (Tennessee), which sustained the demurrers of appellees, the state attorney general, the county, and a corporation, to the taxpayer's complaint in an action to enjoin a proposed lease transaction between the county and the corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county entered into a contract with the corporation whereby the corporation would build an industrial building on county land, for which the county would issue bonds and then lease the land from the county. The corporation also obtained an option to purchase the land. The taxpayer filed suit to enjoin the consummation of this transaction, and appellees filed demurrers. The trial court sustained the demurrers, and the taxpayer appealed, arguing that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 5-715 was unconstitutional. The court disagreed, noting that, since there were no relevant differences between counties and municipalities, the statute had to be upheld as a similar one had been upheld for cities. The taxpayer also argued that the lease was not authorized by &sect; 5-715. The court observed that the statute expressly authorized the county to sell and convey such an industrial building. The court also noted that the nominal sum of $ 1,000 in the event the lessee purchased the property was justified in view of the fact that the corporation was obligated to take complete care of the property: paying all taxes, making all necessary repairs and replacements, keeping all insurance in force, etc.</SPAN></P>

Since the Constitution gave the legislature the right to establish courts, it likewise had the right to abolish such courts whenever, in the opinion of the legislature, the public welfare required that to be done. The discretion of the legislature was not subject to review by the courts and it had the right to abolish the circuit court and chancery court of the city.

Priv. Acts ch. 320 (the 1957 Act), which provided for the issuance of additional revenue bonds for the expansion of water, garbage, and fire protection services provided by appellee Fountain City Sanitary District.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The soil of Fountain City tended to wash into a city and pollute its water supply. 1945 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 176, 1947 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 143, and 1949 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 831 created the District, granting it authority to finance a sewer and garbage disposal system through the issuance of revenue bonds. The 1957 Act expanded the service area for the sanitation services. 1957 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 320, &sect; 8 provided for a local election prior to approval of the issuance of bonds. The court agreed with appellants' assertion that &sect; 8 was unconstitutional because it was an unlawful delegation of legislative power. Section 8 attempted to comply with the Home Rule Amendment, Tenn. Const. art. 11, &sect; 9. However, the District was not a municipality and &sect; 9, which required a local referendum for state laws of local effect, was inapplicable to the District. It was unnecessary to hold the entire 1957 Act unconstitutional for the invalidity of 1957 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 320, &sect; 8. The court applied the rule of elision to remove &sect; 8 from the 1957 Act. The 1957 Act was still effective in the absence of &sect; 8 and 1957 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 320 &sect; 6 provided for its continued operability.</SPAN></P>

The pictures were of naked men and women engaged not only in acts of sexual intercourse, but engaged in various unnatural sexual acts the court stated were too reprehensible to put in print. The court affirmed. Section 39-3001 was not unconstitutional. The common sense of the community as well as the sense of decency, propriety, and morality, was sufficient to apply &sect; 39-3001 to each particular case and point out what particular conduct was rendered criminal by it. Here, the writing in the booklets referred to such acts as a vile and depraved mind could conjure up. To say that &sect; 39-3001 prohibiting the possession, sale, and distribution of such materials was unconstitutional was to assert a view that did not appeal to reason. Furthers, defendant failed to preserve error as to allegedly improper evidence because there was no specific statement of the evidence objected to in defendant's motion for a new trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City Commission of the City of Chattanooga enacted a Sunday closing ordinance or blue law. That ordinance, Chattanooga, Tenn., Rev. Ordinances &sect; 34, required most stores to close on Sunday. However, drug stores, filling stations, and curb markets were permitted to remain open. The grocers commenced an action, which sought a declaration that the ordinance was unconstitutional and void. The chancery court sustained a demurrer and dismissed their bill of complaint. The grocers appealed from that decree, which was affirmed. The court noted that general Sunday closing laws were constitutional. Furthermore, an ordinance constituted a deprivation of equal protection only when it subjected persons engaged in the same business to different restrictions or gave those individuals different privileges under like conditions. Therefore, the court rejected the grocer's argument that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it permitted drug stores, filling stations, and curb markets to sell goods that were similar to those offered by grocery stores. Furthermore, the ordinance did not conflict with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-4001 because it did not go beyond the parameters of that provision.</SPAN></P>

The Chancery Court, Claiborne County, Joe M. Carden, Chancellor, entered decree that constitutional provision was not applicable to such statute and that county judge by his conduct had vacated his office. County judge appealed and died while appeal was pending. The Supreme Court, Tomlinson, Justice, held that question as to whether county judge was entitled to hold his office pending appeal of his criminal conviction became moot by reason of his death, and Supreme Court would not decide whether statute was unconstitutional since it was improbable that question would arise often and such question was not a question of public interest.</SPAN></P>

To test the constitutionality of ch. 260, defendant, a business owner, deliberately violated ch. 260. Defendant contended that ch. 260 was an arbitrary exercise of the State's police power. On appeal, the court held that ch. 260 fell within the purview of the State's police power because the allowing of public businesses to operate upon more than a single standard of time would result in inconvenience, confusion, and conflict. The court further found that the enactment of ch. 260 was not an arbitrary exercise of police power because its prohibitions had the tendency to carry its purposes into effect. Defendant also argued that ch. 260 was discriminatory, in that it limited those who came within the specified class to persons owning a place of business, even though there was no valid reason why non-standard time would be more detrimental to the public good.

The chancellor found the Commission's rates to be confiscatory and remanded the cause to the Commission for the receipt of more evidence. The Commission appealed, and the court held that the chancellor had the right to remand the cause as he properly found that the Commission's rates did not produce the minimum rate of return on equity capital or the adjusted net investment rate necessary to perform the services required by the rate order. The court thus agreed with the chancellor's conclusion that such rates were confiscatory and that the Commission should have adjusted them to make a fair return for the company and a fair rate for the users of the utility to pay, even if the Commission had to hold a new hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was in the business of leasing trucks. Under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-3003, sales tax was imposed upon the privilege of leasing out tangible personal property. The taxpayer asserted that the assessment was erroneous because the lessee of the trucks used them in interstate commerce. On appeal, the court affirmed that the lessee's eventual use of the trucks was not relevant because the leases were executed in Tennessee between two in-state corporations. The imposition of sales tax on the truck leases did not impermissibly burden interstate commerce. Under the leases, any use of the trucks in interstate commerce was within the lessee's discretion. The tax was properly imposed on the lessor, not the lessee. The court rejected the taxpayer's argument that the tax could not be imposed unless the personal property, the trucks, were used and consumed in Tennessee and held that the test for the imposition of a tax on a lease was based on the place of the lease's execution. The fact that the trucks were used to transport tax-exempt agricultural products did not render the lease immune to the sales tax.</SPAN></P>

Acts ch. 97, was unconstitutional and that the state legislature did not have the right to levy a privilege tax on stamp companies in the manner and amount that it did. The trial court held that the legislature had the right to levy the tax but that the manner in which it levied the tax was arbitrary and capricious and violated the state constitution. The court held that: (1) 1957 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 97, &sect; 1, violated no constitutional provision where the state legislature's power to declare and tax privileges was unlimited; (2) 1957 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 97, &sect; 2, imposing the tax on merchants who used the services of trading stamp companies but not on merchants who redeemed their own stamps, was an arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable classification that violated Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8, forbidding class legislation absent a reason for the discrimination; and (3) where the act amended an existing act taxing trading stamp companies, which act was valid, 1957 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 97, &sect; 2, was elided and 1957 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 97, &sect; 1, increasing the amount of the tax, was upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation owned both a wholesale division and a retail division and applied to the Commissioner for a permit or license to sell cigarettes as a wholesale dealer. The Commissioner initially approved the application and issued such a license to the corporation, but the corporation's later application for renewal of the license was denied. In its declaratory judgment action, the corporation claimed that it was entitled to the privileges of a wholesale dealer and jobber under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-3106 and the compensation allowed such entities for selling and affixing tobacco stamps to tobacco products. The chancellor entered a decree in favor of defendants, and the corporation appealed. Upon adoption of the chancellor's opinion, the court held that the corporation did not meet the definition of wholesaler under &sect; 67-3106. The court concluded that the legislature would not have conferred the privileges of compensation for affixing tax stamps to all who, as a part of their business, conducted wholesale transactions, and thus, the rebate sought by the corporation was available to those doing business &quot;wholesale only,&quot; which classification was not arbitrary or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The facts showed that the county employed the worker. However, the county contended that the Act required that the widow and the worker be married for at least five years. They were married for slightly less than that length of time. On appeal, the court held that the Act was inarticulately drawn, but it did not have the interpretation that the county placed on it. The worker was still employed at the time of his death, and the widow had a right to the pension regardless of the length of the marriage. The language referring to a five-year period in 1949 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 806 referred to when a worker retired and then died. Further, the widow did not fall into the category of the spouse of a worker who retired prior to the passage of the Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deceased was born in Mississippi in 1864. At the time of his birth slavery had not been abolished in that State. He was an only child. His father had no brothers or sisters. His mother had two brothers and two sisters, who claimed the real property in question as collateral heirs. The deceased and his wife moved to Tennessee. The issue was whether the collateral heirs of the deceased took real estate left by him in preference to the devisees of his wife. The devisees filed the lawsuit under the theory that the deceased, who was born in a slave state before slavery was abolished, was illegitimate, and that under the laws of Tennessee the inheritance from him was governed by the state's statutes controlling illegitimates, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 31-105. On appeal, the court, in upholding the judgment of the intermediate appellate court, concluded that under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 31-303, the public policy of Tennessee was to recognize the deceased as legitimate.

The insurer appealed, and the court held that as the obvious purpose of the act was that as stated in the title to regulate burial insurance, and the provisions of the act were germane to that subject and met the constitutional requirements on that subject, the act was not broader than its caption. The court found that the act was not entirely prohibitory, and under it, nothing was done retroactively, and nothing was taken away from the insurer, except its right to write the kind of insurance in the future that was prohibited by the act. The court determined that the legislature had the purpose in mind in enacting the act of the protection of the public safety, public health, and/or public morals of its people, and thus having determined that the act was reasonable, the court concluded that the act was constitutional. The court also concluded that the act applied to all insurers or burial associations alike, and the fact that the insurer would suffer some pecuniary loss or injury did not establish the act's unreasonableness or invalidity.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court determined that Tenn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court refused to issue an injunction to prevent the principal from desegregating a public high school on the basis of a federal district court's decree that directed the principal and board of education to desegregate that school. The court affirmed based upon the Supremacy Clause of U.S. Const. art. VI. The court held that the federal district court's decree which was based upon the United States Supreme Court's ruling that segregation in public schools was inherently discriminatory in violation of the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV nullified the state's segregation law. As well because the federal district court had acquired jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties, it retained that jurisdiction to the exclusion of all other courts. Finally, the court rejected the citizens' claim that if the state's segregation laws were no longer in force then no money could be spent to support desegregated schools. The court was unwilling to adopt a position that could effectively close a public high school and possibly all other public schools.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainant gasoline dealer filed an action against defendant city in which it sought to have Pulaski, Tenn., City Code tit. 2, &sect; 9-0205 declared invalid and to enjoin the city from enforcing it. The Chancery Court of Giles County (Tennessee) upheld the validity of the ordinance and dismissed the bill. The dealer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance made it unlawful to install within the city any underground gasoline storage tank having a capacity of more than 1,100 gallons and to install more than three tanks on the same premises. The dealer argued that the ordinance allowed previously existing gas stations to operate while prohibiting the dealer from operating a filling station. The court first noted that the ordinance here was not a zoning ordinance but was evidently intended to prevent explosions and a risk of fire. It held that although the city might have the right to regulate the filling station business, it did not have the right to exclude certain persons from engaging in the business while allowing others to do so. Here, the obvious effect of the ordinance was to prohibit the construction of additional filling stations in the city that would compete with those in existence at the time of the passage of the ordinance, thereby creating a monopoly in favor of stations in existence at the time of the enactment of the ordinance. Thus, the ordinance was discriminatory in nature and clearly violated Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teachers entered into contracts with the board for the 1951-1953 school years, which set the teachers' salary at the minimum salary. For the 1951-1953 years, under 1949 Tenn. Pub. Acts 9 (the 1949 Act), the teachers were entitled to the minimum salary for the 1948-1949 school year, plus at least the difference between that 1948-1949 salary and the state schedule was to have been set up 1949-1951. 1951 Tenn. Pub. Acts 132 (the 1951 Act) provided for the teachers' salaries for the 1951-1953 school years, but that Act was declared unconstitutional. The teachers then filed an action seeking to have their 1951-1953 salaries set at the level set under the 1949 Act. The teachers argued that the unconstitutionality of the 1951 Act meant that the 1949 Act was still in effect and entitled to teachers to the higher salary. The trial court held in favor of the teachers and the board sought review. The court found that the 1949 Act was restored by the unconstitutionality of the 1951 Act. The court also found that the teachers were not estopped from seeking the additional salary because they were statutorily entitled to the higher salary regardless of their contract provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Commissioner filed a petition to rehear in the court, complaining: (1) that the court overlooked the fact that the taxes involved accrued in three years and were prior to a federal statute governing atomic energy production; (2) the taxes upon appellant taxpayer were privilege taxes, not property taxes; and (3) the legal incidence of the tax was the determinative test when implied constitutional immunity was claimed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first emphasized that its original opinion limited the power of the State of Tennessee to its right to levy and collect a &quot;gross receipts&quot; tax from such persons, firms, and corporations as were exercising the privilege for and on behalf of themselves, and it was to be distinguished from those who were exercising the privilege on behalf of the federal government. The court found that the cause in no way involved the levying and collecting of an &quot;ad valorem tax&quot; upon the property of the United States Government. The case was never thought of as involving any kind of a tax other than the right of the State of Tennessee to collect a &quot;gross receipts&quot; tax upon funds derived from the collection of revenue by the taxpayer upon property which belonged exclusively to the United States Government. The taxpayer was the owner of no property in the area of operations, and its acts did not amount to engaging in any business for profit. The court reaffirmed its original decision, finding that the &quot;privilege&quot; taxes, gross receipts taxes, were indirectly exacted upon government property, or the use of such property. The Commissioner's tax was in violation of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The Clerk claimed that 1953 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 316 and 1955 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 135 were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1953 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 316 created a General Sessions Court for Cocke County. It also created the office of clerk of that court, fixed the salary of this office, and provided that the salary was paid by the county and that all the fees of the office should be the property of the county. 1955 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 135 increased the fixed salary of that clerk. The court found that there was no general law creating the office of clerk of the general sessions court in those counties of the state having such courts. Therefore, the provision that created that office for Cocke County did not suspend any general law. The court determined that the act in question was a special act affecting Cocke County in its governmental capacity. The legislature could constitutionally enact a special act affecting one particular county or municipality alone in its political or governmental capacity, provided such special act was not contrary to the provisions of a general law that was applicable to all the counties or municipalities. The court affirmed and rejected the Clerk's contention that this provision in each of the special acts in question was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The objectors perfected their appeal and assigned errors, notwithstanding the fact that the judge resigned shortly after the trial court sustained his demurrer. The court found that it no longer had jurisdiction of the ouster claim where the judge's term of office had expired because nothing could be done upon decree except to tax costs. Upon the announcement regarding the demurrer and pursuant to the judge's motion, the trial court overruled his motion to have make the county party defendant, adjudge the county liable for compensation due the attorneys in representing him, and to fix the amount of compensation. The court dismissed, finding that it could find no way to bring the case within the provisions of Tenn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees brought a quo warranto action against appellants, three members of the Lake County Board of Education, in which appellees claimed that the three members were ineligible to hold office under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 49-209. The Chancery Court of Lake County (Tennessee) ruled in favor of appellees. The three members appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the three members was the clerk and master of the chancery court, and all three belonged to the county court. Under &sect; 49-209, members of a quarterly county court could not serve on a county board of education, but 1929 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 334, which applied to Lake County alone, gave that county the right to elect members of the county court or justices of the peace to its board of education. The court held that the private act was unconstitutional as a violation of Tenn. Const. art. 11, &sect; 8. The private act set forth qualifications for board of education members in Lake County that were entirely different from those fixed by general law for such officers in other counties. Accordingly, the three members were ineligible to hold office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Attorney General of the State of Tennessee and other state officials, challenged a decree from the Chancellery Court (Tennessee), which overruled certain grounds of appellants' demurrer to an original bill and which declared that the apportionment legislation, 1901 Tenn. Pub. Acts 122, codified as Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 3-101 et seq., had expired and was no longer effective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee voters filed a bill that sought, in part, a declaration that the Apportionment Act of 1901 was unconstitutional. They also sought an injunction restraining appellants from holding any election under it. The court reversed the decision and recognized that, if the Act of 1901 was to be declared unconstitutional, then the de facto doctrine could not be applied to maintain the present members of the general assembly in office. Once it was determined that the present incumbents were not de jure officers, they had no color of authority and could not serve as de facto officers. The ultimate result of holding the Act unconstitutional would be to deprive the state of the present legislature and the means of electing a new one and ultimately bring about the destruction of the state itself. The court held that, where the voters' bill failed to allege the existence of a prior valid apportionment act to fall back upon, then, in that situation, the court would not declare the Act invalid. The court would not declare an apportionment act invalid unless there was a prior valid act on which they could fall back.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for violating Tenn. Code &sect; 6770.33 (Supp.), which prohibited a gasoline dealer from offering premiums or gratuities in the sale of gasoline. A Shelby County trial court (Tennessee) held the statute to be unconstitutional and quashed the indictment. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the statute was a legitimate exercise of the police power for the purpose of preventing frauds upon the public and of preventing deception in the sale of gasoline. The court rejected this argument. It stated that although statutes requiring a dealer to post the price of gasoline had been upheld, when a statute went further and prohibited as a trade stimulant the giving of a premium or gratuity, the statute was unconstitutional. Such a provision was outside the scope of the police power and did not relate to the general welfare. To uphold the statute would be to allow the State to exercise control over all private enterprises. As long as a dealer's business did not offend the public morals and work an injustice on the public, his constitutional right to pursue it on equal terms to that allowed to others in like businesses was beyond question, even though the dealer's methods might have a tendency to draw trade to him to the detriment of competitors.</SPAN></P>
