</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff motor vehicle dealership brought an action against defendant surety company, to recover under a bond issued to a used car dealer. On the parties' motions for summary judgment, the District Court for Cuming County (Nebraska) found that the surety company was liable under that provision of the bond which covered dealers' misappropriation of funds belonging to purchasers. The surety appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The used car dealer purchased cars from the dealership and subsequently defaulted on his payments. The appellate court had to determine: (1) if the used car dealer was protected under the bond; and (2) whether the used car dealer misappropriated the funds of any purchasers. The appellate court held that although the 1989 amendments to Neb. Rev. Sat. &sect; 60-1419 (Reissue 1993), were not made part of the bond issued by the surety, they automatically became part of the bond. Consequently, the appellate court considered the case at bar as though the bond provided according to &sect; 60-1419. The surety contended that motor vehicle dealer's bonds issued under &sect; 60-1419 were designed only to protect consumers and not to serve as an insurance policy for the business dealings between car dealers. The appellate court disagreed. The statute protected car dealers as well as other persons, but only from the acts enumerated in the statute, it did not protect against all losses. Upon delivery of the vehicles the dealership did not retain or reserve titles to them. The dealer's failure to remit payment was merely a failure to pay his debts, not a misappropriation of funds of purchasers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services sought review of three orders concerning the disposition of appellee minor. One of the orders committed the minor to the Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Center (YRTC) facility operated by the Office of Juvenile Services (OJS), upon a motion to revoke probation, allowed the juvenile court to retain jurisdiction over the minor until completion of treatment at the YRTC.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three appeals were consolidated for determination by the court. The department argued that the juvenile court could not retain jurisdiction over the minor once it had committed him to OJS. The court reversed the juvenile court's order. In so ruling, the court concluded that under the Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-245 et seq. (1993 &amp; Cum. Supp. 1996), a juvenile court's jurisdiction over an adjudicated minor continued after he was committed to a YRTC; however, the juvenile court did not have jurisdiction over OJS in placing, managing, or discharging the committed juvenile. The court found plain error in the juvenile court's failure to adequately advise the minor of his right to counsel before accepting his admission that he violated the terms of his probation and therefore reversed the order and remanded the cause with directions to vacate the order and to entertain new proceedings on the county attorney's motion alleging that the minor had violated the terms of his probation. The court further determined that its conclusion rendered the two subsequent appeals moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed a juvenile court order that committed a minor to the YRTC facility operated by the OJS, which also allowed the juvenile court to retain jurisdiction over the minor until completion of treatment at the YRTC.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The leases did not provide for rent, had a primary term of 32 years subject to annual renewal, and did not give either party an automatic right of termination. The lessor decided it was going to charge rent and attempted to modify the lease, alleging the leases were contrary to public policy, ultra vires, and void. The court held there was a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of whether the leases gave the lessees a gift of free use of public property. Under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 70-625 (Reissue 1976), the lessor had the power to hold, sell, and lease real and personal property and under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 70-655 (Reissue 1976), the lessor was required to collect adequate rent. The court reversed in part, holding there were a genuine issue of material facts as to whether the leases were contrary to public policy and ultra vires and remanded for further proceedings. The court affirmed in part, finding the trial court erred in declaring the sublease between a lessee and a sublessee, who was a member of the lessor's board, was void because the sublessee's interest was not at issue. The court held the denial of the lessor's motion for summary judgment was proper.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment as to the trial court's refusal to grant the lessor's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

The camper filed a negligence suit against the camp facility and the school district that sponsored the trip. The district court entered judgments for the camper. However, on appeal, the court reversed the judgments for the camper. The court held that the camp facility was not liable pursuant to the Nebraska Recreation Liability Act (the act), Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 37-1001 et seq. The court further held that because the fee charged to the school district for the renting of the facility was not an admission charge, and because the camp was open to the public, the camp facility was entitled to the protections of the act. The court also held that because the school district had not opened the camp to the public, it could not avail itself of the protections of the act. Finally, the court held that the camper had been a business invitee of a temporary lessee, the school district, so the school district did not owe the camper the duty to inspect for or to warn of latent defects in the camp facility equipment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee brought a declaratory judgment action against defendants seeking to be reinstated in the division of employment's retirement plan. The trial court held that the employee had not filed a grievance within the time period provided for in the state employees' labor agreement, sustained defendants' motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the employee's action for lack of jurisdiction. The employee sought review. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the judgment. The court held that the trial court did have jurisdiction over the matter. The court found that pursuant to Neb.

He was charged with possession of a short shotgun and violation of a protection order. The police then obtained a search warrant for his house based on the belief that he was a danger to his estranged wife. During the search, the police recovered several suicide tapes and notes. He was then charged with attempted kidnapping and possession of a deadly weapon during commission of a felony and was convicted on all charges. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. Based on defendant's actions of sneaking around the premises where his wife was working and blocking access to her vehicle, the officer had probable cause to believe that he violated a protection order.

On appeal from the district court's decision to affirm his conviction, defendant claimed that the district court erred in finding that &sect; 27.03.220 did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Nebraska Constitution and in finding that &sect; 27.03.220 did not violate his tenants' rights to privacy and association guaranteed by the 1st and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. The court affirmed, holding that defendant did not overcome the ordinance's presumption of validity. The city's stated objectives included the sanctity of the family, quiet neighborhoods, low population, few motor vehicles, and low transiency were legitimate. The court held the city's objectives were legitimate and were rationally related to the means employed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city installed a new water meter. In order to install the meter, the city's employee had to turn off the water supply from the main line. As a result, the employee broke off the lead pipe leading from the water main. A city ordinance required that the replacement pipes be lead free and that the city was not responsible for costs beyond those incurred in its commercial means for water service. Thus, the homeowner replaced the water line. The owner filed an action against the city to recover the cost. The city council denied the owner's claim. The owner appealed and the trial court granted the city a special appearance and dismissed the appeal on the basis that it did not comply with the Political Subdivisions Tort Claims Act (Act). The court found that the owner could not argue that the trial court erred because he did not assign as error the constitutionality of the ordinance and thus the trial court did not rule on that issue. The court also found that the city's special appearance should not have been sustained because the trial court had personal jurisdiction over the parties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of committing incest in violation of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-703. Defendant brought a petition for postconviction relief, alleging that his trial counsel was ineffective because he did not raise the issue of competency or insanity with the court. The trial court denied defendant's petition for postconviction relief, and he appealed. The court ruled that the conviction of an accused person while he was legally incompetent violated the constitutional guarantee of substantive due process. Further, the court held that due process required that a hearing be held whenever there was evidence that raised a sufficient doubt about the mental competency of an accused to stand trial. The court reversed the judgment denying defendant's petition for postconviction relief, concluding that the trial court's failure to hold a full, fair, and adequate hearing affording defendant procedural due process rights at the competency and plea hearing, coupled with the failure to conduct a sua sponte competency hearing at the time of sentencing, was a denial of due process.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that such fees could be awarded when authorized by statute or when a recognized and accepted uniform course of procedure had been to allow such recovery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer stopped defendant after observing traffic violations, including straddling the white line and failure to signal.

On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that the officer had a reasonable suspicion, based on articulable facts, that a crime was being committed by the driver of the vehicle. Any of the violations of state statutes testified to by the officer was independently sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion. A certified copy of a conviction for third-offense DUI, showing that defendant's license had been &quot;revoked and suspended,&quot; was relevant to a conviction under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-669.07(6) for driving under a license revoked pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-669.07(2)(c), as it had a tendency to make the existence of the revocation more probable than without the evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving while intoxicated, fourth offense. Although he demanded for a preliminary hearing, no action was taken upon his demand. Following a bench trial, defendant was found guilty, and an enhancement hearing was held. During the enhancement hearing, the State introduced evidence of two of defendant's prior convictions for driving while intoxicated. Following the hearing, defendant was sentenced to six months in jail, a $ 500 fine, and a suspension of his driver's license for 15 years. Defendant appealed. In affirming, the court rejected defendant's argument that the denial of his request for a preliminary hearing was unconstitutional. Because defendant failed to properly raise any constitutional issue at the trial level, the issue would not be considered on appeal. Further, the court rejected defendant's argument that evidence of his prior convictions was erroneously received into evidence. In enhancement proceedings, the State was only required to show that, at the time of the prior convictions, defendant had, or waived, counsel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee sought review of the decision of the District Court for Douglas County (Nebraska), which sustained a demurrer pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 25-806(1), (3), (6) (Reissue 1989) and overruled in favor of defendants, Board of Regents (Board), chancellor, and general counsel, a motion to disqualify counsel in an action brought for breach of employment contract and conspiracy to tortiously interfere with a business relationship.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a university committee recommended the termination of the employee, a full-time professor, outside counsel was appointed to report on the proposed termination. The employee claimed that the chancellor and the general counsel conspired to keep the report's exoneration a secret. The employee brought an action for breach of contract and conspiracy to tortiously interfere with a business relationship. The lower court sustained the demurrer of the Board, the chancellor, and the general counsel, pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 25-806(1), (3), (6) (Reissue 1989), and overruled the employee's motion to disqualify opposing counsel. The court reversed the portion of the lower court's decision sustaining the demurrer under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-806(3) (Reissue 1989), excepting the open meeting law portion, because the instant action and another state lawsuit were not the same cause consisting of the same operative facts. Thus, the employee should have been allowed to amend his contract claim as to the Board because a reasonable probability existed that an amendment would allege compliance with the State Contract Claims Act. The lower court's decision was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the portion of the lower court's decision that denied the employee leave to amend the remaining allegations in his petition based on contract as to the Board, excepting the open meeting portion, in favor of the employee. The court's decision was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

After defendant was arrested, his bags were inventoried as bulk property but were later searched to find the black jacket and white shoes. Defendant contended inter alia that the lower court erred in not suppressing the evidence seized from his bags, and in permitting certain witnesses to testify as to past acts. The court ruled that no prejudicial errors were committed. The court held that: (1) although the search of defendant's bags was illegal as an improper inventory search, the admission of the items seized was not prejudicial because defendant was identified by his characteristics, not his clothes; (2) the witness' testimony of defendant's suspicious acts was properly admitted for the limited purpose of placing defendant in the area, and for purposes of planning and identity; and (3) defendant's voice exemplar was properly excluded because there was no evidence that it would be genuine.</SPAN></P>

Defendant could not properly recite the alphabet and failed other field sobriety tests. He was arrested and later charged and convicted. On appeal, he argued that two motions to suppress should have been granted. The court disagreed, affirming his conviction for DWI. The court found sufficient evidence to convict him of DWI. The court held that the first motion to suppress was properly denied in that the officer had probable cause to stop a vehicle that had no license plates. The second motion to suppress was properly denied because Miranda did not protect against non-testimonial statements such as reciting the alphabet. The court held that the sentence was not excessive because it was within the statutory range for DWI. However, the conviction for failure to appear had to be vacated because Neb. Rev.

After pulling defendant over, the trooper detected a strong odor of alcohol coming from within the vehicle and noticed that defendant's eyes were watery. He also noticed poor finger dexterity by defendant as he fumbled for his license. After defendant stepped out of the vehicle, the trooper observed that his balance was poor. Defendant failed several field sobriety tests, but refused to submit to a breath test after being taken to a county jail. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Neb. Rev.

The court noted, however, that the record contained no evidence that a criminal complaint arising out of his refusal to take the test was filed and dismissed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by information with burglary. His motion to suppress all statements he made, all observations of law enforcement, and all evidence obtained by law enforcement, specifically items seized by warrant, was granted on the ground that the warrant was the result of privileged information provided by defendant's spouse. On appeal, the court held that, as the search warrant was issued by a Kansas court, the affidavit in support of the warrant was prepared by Kansas law enforcement, and the initial investigation and subsequent search were conducted in Kansas, Kansas law applied to the question of whether the marital privilege extended to make the warrant invalid. The court found that under Kansas law, defendant had no right to bar testimony at trial of other witnesses discovered as the result of information lawfully obtained from his wife; therefore, the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine was not applicable in the absence of a showing of police misconduct.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former husband appealed from the decree dissolving his marriage on the grounds that it did not award him alimony from his former wife. On appeal, the court affirmed the decree. The court held that there was no reason why the circumstances of his partnership interest in an auto parts business compelled an alimony award because he testified that he was happy with his partnership and would not leave, even for a higher salary. Although the length of the marriage alone would not prohibit an alimony award, nothing in the record indicated that the former husband significantly interrupted his education or career to make contributions to the marriage or the care of the children. The parties had fair arrangements for the support of the family and child care, so it did not mandate the award of alimony to either party. The former husband was gainfully employed with sufficient funds to maintain himself. The former wife's substantially greater income did not entitle him to alimony because it could not be used to equalize parties' incomes. On the whole, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the circumstances did not warrant awarding the former husband alimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of conviction of possession of marijuana with intent to deliver by the District Court for Douglas County (Nebraska). Defendant had filed a motion to suppress the marijuana and any statements he gave to police upon his arrest, on the basis that the search was illegal because Omaha police officers failed to comply with the &quot;knock and announce&quot; requirements of the search warrant. The motion was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the district court's conviction of defendant and its denial of his motion to suppress, defendant argued that the district court erred when it denied his motion to suppress because the marijuana was seized as a result of a search after police failed to knock and announce their identity and purpose and wait a reasonable amount of time and there was no evidence of exigent circumstances to support immediate, unannounced entry. Reversing the trial court's judgment, the court found that there was no evidence in the record to support a finding that there were exigent circumstances, which would excuse compliance with the knock and announce requirements under the Fourth Amendment. The police officer testified that the police made a conscious decision not to ask for a no-knock warrant, as they believed it was unnecessary. The tape recordings from the scene showed that a knock occurred, but the police made no audible announcement. The court noted that there was no evidence in the record to support a finding that there was an implied or constructive refusal to admit the police officers within 15 seconds of the first knock. The search and seizure was therefore unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted that there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1202(1) (Reissue 1989). The court reversed the order. The court reviewed the record to determine whether the knife fell under the category of &quot;any other deadly weapon.&quot; No evidence was adduced at the hearing as to the use or intended use of the knife. No evidence was presented about the character of the knife, aside from the officer's testimony. The knife was not offered into evidence. There was no evidence presented at the hearing from which the court could infer that the knife was used as a deadly weapon or was intended to be used as a deadly weapon. The court concluded that the circumstantial evidence or lack thereof was insufficient to establish that the knife was a deadly weapon.</SPAN></P>

The injured child suffered her injuries while living with the mother and her boyfriend, and the child reported that the boyfriend was the person who hurt her. Later, the mother married the boyfriend. The father of the children had little involvement in their lives and was unwilling to take custody of the children after the adjudication of neglect. The parents claimed that the lower court's judgment terminating their rights was not supported by clear and convincing evidence. The mother claimed that the lower court erred in denying her request for a jury trial. The court held that (1) Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-279.01 did not entitle parents in a proceeding to terminate parental rights to a jury trial; (2) the mother's challenge to the constitutionality of Neb. Rev.

He filed three pretrial motions to suppress evidence, two of which were overruled by the trial court. A jury found defendant guilty of both charges. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly overruled two of the pretrial motions to suppress because, considering the totality of the circumstances, the evidence supported the trial court's finding that defendant voluntarily consented to the search of the automobile. Additionally, there was no evidence in the record that the police officer in any way overtly or subtly coerced defendant to consent to the search. The court further held, after considering the totality of the circumstances surrounding defendant's arrest, that probable cause existed to believe that defendant had committed the offense of unlawful possession of a controlled substance, and the search of the vehicle should not be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was approached at his residence by a sheriff's deputy and questioned about the calf. He then wrote out a confession stating that he thought his son deserved the calf because of his work for the employer and that the son was to show the calf at a fair. Defendant argued, inter alia, that the confession should have been suppressed because he was in custody and had not been read his Miranda rights. The court affirmed the conviction. The court found that the interrogation of defendant prior to the giving of the confession was not custodial. There was no evidence that defendant was restrained from moving about his residence. He voluntarily acquiesced to the deputy's questioning and there was no evidence that he was coerced during questioning. The appearance of one law enforcement officer did not create a police-dominated atmosphere. The court also found that the statement was not constitutionally involuntary because it was not extorted by means of coercive activity. Vigorous questioning did not undermine a valid confession.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his motion for postconviction relief, after being convicted of DWI, third offense, should have been granted because his counsel had failed to advise him of his right to a jury trial. In order to establish a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, defendant was required to prove both that his counsel was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced him. Counsel was required to research the law applicable to the facts. In this case, counsel had failed to learn that the law precluding jury trials for DWI, third offense, had been held to be unconstitutional and unenforceable. Thus, counsel's performance was deficient. However, defendant was also required to prove that he was prejudiced by the deficient performance. Defendant had failed to plead prejudice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for striking the superintendent while awaiting trial on other charges. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that defendant was not selectively prosecuted to prevent his exercise of his constitutional rights because the prosecutor's decision to file charges was within his authority and was not to punish defendant for successfully appealing other convictions. The court ruled that defendant was properly denied a continuance because he was informed of his duties as a pro se litigant and had sufficient time to prepare, and the trial court was in no way responsible for his failure to be prepared for trial, noting that a letter stating a hearing date for pretrial motions defendant had not filed did not excuse his failure to prepare. The court found that a brief discussion in which the trial court told the prosecutor and defendant's standby counsel that he wanted to avoid a retrial was not an ex parte communication requiring the trial court's recusal. The court ruled that defendant was not entitled to credit on his sentence for time served because he was in jail awaiting trial on unrelated charges, which time could not have been credited to him under &sect; 28-932(2).</SPAN></P>

The mother changed her mind and wanted he baby back, and filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus for the baby's return.

The trial court denied the mother's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. On appeal, the court affirmed the order of the trial court. The court held that the relinquishment was validly executed and irrevocable. The burden was on the mother to prove the relinquishment was not voluntarily given, and she failed to do this. Acceptance of the relinquishment by a member of the adoption agency staff was proper and did not have to be done by the agency director. The relinquishment was not defective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was observed from the air unlawfully speeding at 67 m.p.h. in a 55-m.p.h. zone. The officer in the air radioed an officer on the ground who stopped and ticketed defendant. Defendant alleged that another car had been observed, not his. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding sufficient evidence in the testimony of the officer in the air to support the judgment. The court found that the trial court did accept defendant's application to proceed in forma pauperis. Defendant's motion for court-appointed counsel was correctly denied because he was not charged with a felony or with a misdemeanor for which imprisonment could be imposed. Instead, he was charged by complaint with a traffic infraction under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-602(107) (Reissue 1988), and the penalty for a first-offense traffic infraction was a fine of not more than $ 100 under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-6,112 (Reissue 1988). The court held that the complaint sufficiently informed defendant of the charge against him, and his motion to quash was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state trooper and a police officer, while patrolling a highway, observed a pickup truck traveling 26 m.p.h. in an area with a posted speed limit of 55 m.p.h. and weaving across the centerline. After they stopped the truck, the officers noted that defendant's eyes were watery, his speech was slow and mumbled, and he smelled of alcohol. Defendant failed the field sobriety tests. He was arrested and given the required warnings. He consented to take the breath test, which produced a reading of .110. On the present appeal, the court held that the testimony of the two officers was clearly sufficient to establish a prima facie case. Because of the change in Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-669.07 (Cum. Supp. 1992), the need to use the percentage of alcohol in the breath to establish the amount of alcohol in the blood was eliminated because it became a crime to have above a certain amount of alcohol in the breath. The State's evidence of the result of defendant's breath test was sufficient to establish guilt. The testimony of a deputy sheriff regarding the Intoxilyzer's accuracy and the Legislature's action was not prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to two DWIs. He was represented by counsel and fully informed of his rights. After the third DWI arrest, the State sought to use the other two to enhance the punishment. However, in the &quot;separate proceedings,&quot; defendant contended that the prior DWI pleas were invalid because he was not fully informed of his Boykin rights. The appellate court affirmed. The court exhaustively examined the history of collateral attacks of prior convictions for enhancement purposes. In summary, &quot;separate proceedings&quot; were no longer mandated for challenging prior convictions. &quot;Separate proceedings&quot; were no longer a valid means of raising a Boykin challenge to a prior conviction. The court reasoned that this holding followed from the most recent law of the United States Supreme Court on the subject. The only exception to the new rule was when the prior plea transcript failed to disclose whether a defendant had counsel or waived counsel and that the defendant was sentenced to actual imprisonment as a result of the plea.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought an action to enjoin an ordinance enacted by the city. Plaintiffs challenged the annexation statute and the ordinance on several grounds. After a trial, the district court dismissed plaintiffs' request for injunction and dismissed their second amended petition. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that because plaintiffs failed to comply with the terms of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-21,159, the constitutionality of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-117 was never properly before the trial court, and plaintiffs were not entitled to declaratory relief on the issue. The court found that the district court correctly concluded that the city was not annexing an area solely for revenue purposes. In ruling on plaintiffs' second motion for continuance, the trial judge stated that he did not wish to delay a decision in this case any longer. Under such circumstances, the court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in either denying plaintiffs' continuance or denying plaintiffs' motion to supplement the record.</SPAN></P>

The district court reversed the order that terminated the father's parental rights and remanded the case. The adoptive parents appealed. The court affirmed the district court's order in part, but also ordered that the father should have custody of his children. The court held that the father was not required to file a notice of intent to claim paternity under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-104.02 (Reissue 1993) because there was an established familial relationship. The court found that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-104.06 (Reissue 1993) did not abrogate the doctrine of parental preference. The court concluded that the county court did not have jurisdiction to terminate parental rights using the Nebraska Juvenile Code provisions in Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-292 (Reissue 1993).

The court affirmed and held that the three crimes separately charged were petty and whether tried separately or together, did not require a jury because defendants were not at risk for incarceration greater than six months. The court also held that the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions because it was undisputed that defendants refused to leave the center when asked to do so by the center's representatives and by police officers. It was also undisputed that defendants chose to have the officers carry them to the police bus after their arrest, which was an act that obstructed or interfered with the officers' performance of an official duty.</SPAN></P>

The officers requested and received an order authorizing the use of a frequency detection (IFR) device on one of defendants' cell phones and a pen register order for another cell phone.

Defendants sought to suppress the evidence seized as a result of the execution of those warrants. The court reversed the trial court's decision granting defendants' motion to suppress. The court held that because there was no privacy interest in phone records, for the authorities to obtain judicial permission for use of a pen register, they only had to demonstrate that the information was relevant to an ongoing investigation.

The court held the following: (1) Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-319 (Reissue 1989) provided that any person who subjected another person to sexual penetration was guilty of sexual assault in the first degree; (2) by the express terms of the statute, a person more than 19 years of age committed the crime of first degree sexual assault if the victim was less than 16 years of age; (3) the purpose of the statutory rape law had always been to protect a child from being taken advantage of by an adult even when the child consented, and a child was said to be &quot;subjected&quot; to penetration, because, as a matter of law, the child could not consent to sexual intercourse; and (4) a trial court was not required to instruct on the effect of a character trait of a defendant unless the defendant successfully offered evidence of a character trait that was pertinent to the crime charged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. He appealed directly to the supreme court where his appointed counsel argued that the trial court erroneously denied defendant's motion to suppress. Also appearing pro se, defendant filed two separate appellate briefs claiming numerous other errors. The supreme court affirmed defendant's conviction. Ultimately, defendant filed a motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to the Act, claiming ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel. The district court denied defendant's motion. On appeal, the court held that defendant raised, or could have raised, on direct appeal the questions regarding trial counsel's performance presented by his post-conviction action. A post-conviction relief motion could not be used to secure review of such issues, no matter how those issues were phrased or rephrased. Further, because defendant undertook to remedy appellate counsel's perceived ineffectiveness by arguing additional appellate issues, defendant did not suffer loss of appellate review and could not, on post-conviction review, successfully complain of ineffective appellate representation.</SPAN></P>

The department had denied the day-care facility license to the applicant because, when she had held a previous day-care facility license, she had administered nonprescription medication to children in her care.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant was originally licensed in 1985. In 1990, she was charged with child abuse for watering down adult strength medicine and giving it to a child. The child died. The applicant was acquitted of the charge, but the department denied her request to renew her license. The department argued that the district court erred by basing its standard of review on an unconstitutional interpretation of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 84-917(Supp. 1992) in violation of the separation of powers doctrine. The court held that the district court properly reviewed the department's order de novo on the record. The court found that there was no conflict regarding the facts; the only conflict was in the interpretation thereof. The court held that when the department denied a caregiver's license application &quot;for cause,&quot; such decision had to be based upon reasonable grounds. Under Neb. Admin. Code tit. 474, ch. 6, &sect; 004.08F (1986), the department had established a regulation that allowed alternative compliance; therefore, it could not deny alternative compliance arbitrarily.

The district court found no error from the record of the proceedings and found that the council had used the proper criteria when it deliberated whether to grant appellant a renewal of his license. The court found that because the Nebraska Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the statute under which the city's decision was appealed, it did not have jurisdiction over the appeal and dismissed. Under the 1984 version of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 53-1,116, appeals regarding the denial of a liquor license could only be had by filing a petition in the district court for Lancaster County.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the District Court, Douglas County (Nebraska), to the court after his application for postconviction relief made using Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-3001 et seq. (Reissue 1989 &amp; Cum. Supp. 1992) was denied. He had been convicted of sexual assault, false imprisonment, and using a firearm to do a felony. An issue was presented by the trial court's pre-sentencing finding that defendant was not treatable regarding mental disorder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that defendant was not a treatable mentally disordered sex offender. At the time that defendant was sentenced, the Mentally Disordered Sex Offender Act (MDA), Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 29-2911 to 29-2921 (Reissue 1989), was applicable; it was later repealed and replaced. Per the court, there was no cognizable issue for the postconviction proceeding as the MDA did not allow any enhancement of defendant's sentence for being a mentally disordered sex offender, and Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-3001 could be used only to determine whether or not defendant's conviction was void or a voidable infringement of a constitutional right; the court found that except for defendant's assertions there was no evidence that the trial court enhanced the sentence based on the finding. In other words, no constitutional, right was at stake. However, the court did not indicate whether or not the statute allowed for civil commitment following completion of sentence. Defendant also brought up the fact that after he was examined by two appointed psychiatrists he waived a third psychiatric examination on counsel's advice, but the court would not second-guess that advice as a matter of trial strategy.</SPAN></P>

In reversing and remanding, the court concluded that the citation issued to defendant simply stated &quot;unlicensed vehicles&quot; and indicated the particular ordinance that defendant was accused of violating. There was no offense of unlicensed vehicles, and the complaints failed to set forth the essential elements of the crime charged. While a charge in the words of the statute or ordinance was sufficient, citing the ordinance by number was not the same as charging an offense in the words of the ordinance. A defendant must be able to determine the offense with which he has been charged without being required to go beyond the complaint.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The car dealership contended that it was entitled to a deficiency against the debtors after the resale of the debtor's repossessed automobile and that its right to recover a deficiency was not barred by its failure to provide notice of the sale to the debtors. The court reversed the summary judgment against the car dealership and remanded for further proceedings. The court noted that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9-504 (Reissue 1980), in effect at the time of repossession, had been interpreted to bar the recovery of any deficiency absent notice of the sale to the debtors. The court determined that &sect; 9-504 (Reissue 1992), in effect at the time of the resale, did not condition the recovery of a deficiency on notice to the debtors, but permitted the debtors to recover any loss sustained by the failure to provide notice. Because the debtors did not have a vested interest in the former provision and because the amended provision applied to any notices or resales after its passage, the court concluded that the amended provision applied and that the car dealership was not barred from recovering a deficiency by its failure to provide notice of sale.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sprayed a victim in the face with mace and grabbed the victim's purse in a parking lot. The victim went to the car in which defendant had gone and attempted to reach in to retrieve her purse. She was again sprayed with mace, became entangled in the seatbelt strap, and awoke in an intensive care unit of a hospital after having been dragged by the car at speeds of 50 m.p.h. There was a trail of blood at least 1.6 miles long. Defendant was convicted. Part of his sentence included solitary confinement beginning on the anniversary date of the crime, so that he would be reminded of the terrible ordeal the victim was enduring. On appeal, the court held that the amount of time of imprisonment was not excessive or an abuse of discretion given the senseless nature of the crimes, the violence involved, and the pain and suffering caused to the victim. However, because May 4, 1993 Neb. Laws, L.B. 529 deleted the portion of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-2204(1) (Reissue 1989) that provided for solitary confinement as part of a sentence, the solitary confinement part of the sentences had to be vacated because it was intended to be part of the punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee filed an action against defendant employer in which alleged that the costs for medical treatment she incurred were a covered benefit under the employer's health care plan. The District Court for Buffalo County (Nebraska) entered a judgment for the employee but awarded her approximately one-half of her expenses and denied her claim for prejudgment interest attorney fees. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was hospitalized for treatment of depression and a personality disorder. She argued that all of the costs were covered under the plan. The employer argued that none of her costs were covered because the contract restricted coverage of mental infirmities to that specified for mental disorders, and the employee was entitled only to those limited benefits set out in the contract for treatment of mental disorders. The issue was whether the employee had suffered a mental infirmity or a mental disorder. In affirming the judgment as to liability, the court held that as a matter of law, the health plan contract was ambiguous and the policy must be construed in the employee's favor, which meant that her less serious mental infirmity of major depression and personality disorder was fully covered. The court stated that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have understood the policy to provide the expansive coverage for the less serious mental infirmity and to limit coverage for the more serious mental and nervous disorder. The award was increased to cover all of the employee's expenses because she was entitled to the broader coverage afforded by the policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment that was entered in favor of the employee and against the employer was modified and affirmed as modified. The matter was remanded to the trial court to increase the employee's award to the amount of her medical bills, and to enter a judgment in her favor for attorney fees incurred at trial and at the appellate level.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in federal court for theft from a program receiving federal funds and money laundering. The State charged defendant with two counts of theft by unlawful taking of more than $ 1000, arising from the same events. Defendant filed a plea in bar claiming that the State prosecution was barred by the U.S. and Nebraska Constitutional provisions against double jeopardy. The trial court held that, under the dual sovereignty doctrine, the subsequent State prosecution of defendant did not violate his right to be free of double jeopardy. Defendant appealed. The court held that the trial court's order denying defendant's plea at bar was an order affecting a substantial right in an action and was therefore appealable. The court further held that the double jeopardy clauses of the United States and Nebraska Constitutions did not prohibit successive prosecutions by federal and Nebraska governments in the exercise of concurrent jurisdiction over substantially the same offense. The court rejected defendant's argument that the federal prosecution was a &quot;cover&quot; prosecution by the State. Defendant demonstrated mere cooperation between State and federal agencies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator brought an action against DSS to recover Medicaid payments that it would have received but for a cap imposed by the Nebraska Legislature. The cap had been held unconstitutional by the federal courts. The operator filed a petition to amend its petition to include claims that were barred by the statute of limitations. The trial court held that the amended claims related back to the operator's original claim and permitted the operator to amend its petition. The court observed that a cause of action pleaded by amendment ordinarily related back to the original pleading provided that the claimant sought recovery on the same general set of facts. The test of seeking recovery on the same general set of facts was satisfied because it was the imposition of the cap and the voiding thereof which gave rise to the claims for refund. There was no delay in resolution of the matter because of the amendment and there was no prejudice to DSS in its defense of the claim. It could hardly be said that DSS was unaware of the claim, and the operator's claim was only a small portion of the whole. There was no claim of bad faith because the operator's assertion of inadvertence was unchallenged.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction asserting that he lacked the necessary intent because he was unaware of the results that could occur from shaking his daughter. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction finding that the trial court's judgment was not clearly wrong. According to the court, in the context of a criminal statute, that which was done willfully or purposefully rather than accidentally or involuntarily was done intentionally. The court held that being unaware of the precise injury which could result from criminal conduct did not release the actor from his or her manifested intent to commit the crime. The court concluded that defendant's admittance to shaking the child to the point where her head moved back and forth and that defendant had admitted on two previous occasions that he had shaken the child was sufficient to support his conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended the trial court erred in receiving testimony from minor children who were incompetent to testify and in not granting a new trial due to ineffectiveness of defendant's counsel in failing to object to hearsay testimony. The court held defendant's convictions had to be set aside. The mother of one of the allegedly assaulted children testified that she and her husband had talked to the child about the need to tell the truth, but nothing in the record indicated that the child promised to tell the truth, took an oath or told anyone that she intended to tell the truth while testifying. The trial court thus failed to determine whether the child was competent to testify and did not have a basis for making such a determination. The opinion of the child's mother that the child was competent to testify was not a sufficient foundation. The court also determined that defendant's counsel should have objected to testimony of three witnesses about hearsay statements of the children concerning penetration, the major issue in the case.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the District Court for Knox County (Nebraska), which convicted him of obstructing a peace officer, a violation of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-906(1) (Reissue 1989), and resisting arrest, a violation of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-904(1) (Reissue 1989).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed the trial court erred by excusing an alleged American Indian from the jury panel over defense counsel's objection. The court noted that the rejection of a venireperson as a juror was a matter of discretion with the trial court and would not be overturned unless it was clearly wrong. The court noted that the juror had been &quot;told different stories&quot; about the facts of this case, and when she was asked if it would take evidence to change her mind at this time, she answered yes. Since it was evident that the juror would not start the trial as an impartial juror, it was not clearly wrong to excuse her. Defendant also claimed the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the information at the close of the State's case. However, defendant waived his right to challenge this by proceeding with trial, introducing evidence, and making no further motions at the close of all the evidence. The court also found a series of jury instructions offered by defendant were properly rejected, either as being covered by other instructions, not an accurate interpretation of law, or not supported by evidence. Finally, there was no abuse of discretion in refusing to reduce defendant's bond.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In addition to receiving stolen property, defendant was charged with burglary. After defendant pleaded guilty to receiving stolen property, the State dropped the burglary charge. Theft by receiving stolen property was a Class IV felony, which was punishable by up to five years' imprisonment, a $ 10,000 fine, or both, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-105 (Reissue 1989). In affirming, the court held that the imposed sentence was not excessive even though it took into account information regarding 10 burglaries for which defendant supplied information. The arrangement between the State and defendant was a plea arrangement, not an immunity arrangement. The State kept its terms of the agreement by dropping the burglary charge and by not prosecuting defendant for additional crimes. Therefore, defendant's guilty plea was voluntary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of four counts of robbery under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-324 (Reissue 1989) and four corresponding counts of use of a firearm to commit a felony. He filed a motion to vacate and set aside his convictions and his consecutive sentences. He alleged that because he was subjected to prosecution for multiple violations of a single, statutorily-defined offense, he was deprived of due process. He also alleged that his trial counsel and appellate counsel were ineffective because they failed to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 28-324. The trial court dismissed the inmate's petition. The court held that there were four victims and four crimes and thus, the inmate was subject to punishment for each offense. He was constitutionally charged with and convicted of each of the robberies, as well as the corresponding firearm charges. The inmate's attorneys were not ineffective for failing to challenge &sect; 28-324 because, despite the inmate's contention to the contrary, there was no ambiguity concerning the proper unit of prosecution under &sect; 28-324 for a multivictim robbery. The attorneys would not have been justified in asserting a frivolous position.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that a police officer's investigatory stop leading to his convictions was unlawful due to a lack of reasonable suspicion that defendant was engaged in any criminal activity. Defendant argued that his arrest was the result of an illegal stop and that his motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of that stop should have been granted. In affirming defendant's second offense driving while under the influence of alcoholic liquor conviction, the court held that the investigatory stop of defendant's vehicle was lawful because it was reasonable for the officer to suspect that defendant had committed a road violation when he saw the taillights of defendant's vehicle flicker off and on. The subsequent field sobriety testing of defendant was based upon observations that the officer made following a legitimate stop. In reversing defendant's disorderly conduct conviction, the court held that defendant did not violate &sect; 20-42 by calling the officer an &quot;asshole.&quot; There was no evidence that the officer was injured by virtue of defendant designating him as an &quot;asshole.&quot; The utterance also did not incite an immediate breach of the peace.</SPAN></P>

The injunction issue was tried, and the trial court enjoined the former employees and the employer. The former employees appealed, and the employer cross-appealed. The former employer filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the injunction was not a final order under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-1902 (Reissue 1989) and, hence, not appealable because the issue of damages had not been tried and determined. The court dismissed the appeals of the former employees and the employer for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court held that when a plaintiff sought both an injunction and damages in an action against a defendant, the case was not appealable until the trial court issued an order that finally determined both issues. The damages issue was not incidental and a suit for an injunction was an action, not a special proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer stopped defendant to verify the validity of &quot;in transit&quot; stickers posted on his vehicle.

Defendant again moved to suppress, but his motion was denied. Trial proceeded, and defendant was convicted. He appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that, under Neb. Rev.
