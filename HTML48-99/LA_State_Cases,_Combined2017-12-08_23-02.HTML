The oyster lease owners failed to establish that the State acted in direct violation of the Louisiana constitution or prohibitory law. To the contrary, the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries was specifically granted authority to include stipulations in oyster leases. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:425(C). Additionally, the secretary was afforded authority and discretion in determining whether to grant or renew oyster leases. Given the authority and discretion afforded the secretary, coupled with the great discretion afforded the trial judge to grant or deny a preliminary injunction, the appellate court determined the trial judge did not err in denying the preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress, that the evidence was insufficient, that an excessive sentence was imposed, and that a mistrial should have been ordered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was stopped by police in his vehicle because his rear taillight was not functioning. The police discovered a gun and 31 bags of crack cocaine in the vehicle. Defendant was found guilty of possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute and appealed. Upon review, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court found that defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied by the trial court because the search of defendant's vehicle was lawful. The court determined that the evidence presented at trial was apparently accepted by the jury and was sufficient to support defendant's conviction. Defendant's sentence was not excessive because the trial judge adequately considered the criteria set forth by La. Code. Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 and sufficiently examined the circumstances of the case and the background of defendant. The court concluded that the record clearly supported the enhanced sentence of 40 years at hard labor. The court held that there was no error in failing to grant defendant's motion for a mistrial, as the trial court admonished the jury to disregard a witness' comment about prior crimes and the remark did not deny defendant a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mayor was involved in a dispute with the city board concerning the passage of city ordinances. The mayor filed a suit for a preliminary injunction prohibiting the city board from enforcing one of the ordinances. The trial court upheld the ordinance and ordered the mayor to submit nominations to the city board for a utilities director within 30 days. Thereafter, the city attorney filed a rule of contempt against the mayor for failing to make a timely nomination. The trial court dismissed the rule for contempt, and the mayor sought reimbursement for attorney fees and costs under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42.261(E). The trial court denied the request and the mayor appealed. The court affirmed and held that &sect; 42.261(E), as previously declared unconstitutional, was unconstitutional in its entirety and not in part. The court ruled that La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 863, which granted authority for sanctions when pleadings were note well-grounded, did not apply because the city was not entirely without justification in its claims. Finally, the court held that the city and city attorney were not entitled to damages for a frivolous appeal because the mayor genuinely advocated her claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish No. 382-898, Section I (Louisiana), which convicted him of first degree murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. Defendant asserted that the trial court committed numerous errors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Three men were indicted for the first-degree murder of a 12-year-old boy after he was killed in a drive-by shooting. Defendant was tried separately and was convicted. Defendant appealed and the court affirmed. The court found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30 (A)(1), (3), relating to drive-by shootings, was not vague or overly broad because a person of ordinary intelligence could easily discern its meaning and its description of those covered. As to the contested statements of the prosecutor, the court stated that the trial judge reprimanded counsel but defendant failed to request an admonition or mistrial. Thus, defendant could not complain of the alleged error on appeal. The court ruled that the trial court did not err in permitting another defendant involved in the murder to take a blanket Fifth Amendment privilege and in refusing defendant's request that the other defendant take the stand in front of the jury to assert the privilege. The other defendant's conviction was not final so that there was exposure to further criminal liability. The court held that the trial court properly charged the jury and that there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injured person contended that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2800, which required actual or constructive knowledge by the State before strict liability could attach to a public body under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2317, was an unconstitutional resurrection of sovereign immunity. However, the court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2800 was not unconstitutional, because it did not limit a plaintiff's right to sue the state for damages, or limit the amount of damages recoverable against the State. Furthermore, it was in effect at time of the accident, notwithstanding that some courts had declared it unconstitutional, because the Louisiana Supreme Court ultimately determined to it be constitutional. The court then held that summary judgment had been properly granted, because affidavits established that DOTD did not have actual notice of the stop sign's absence at the intersection, and the injured person had not submitted countervailing affidavits regarding the State's notice of the missing stop sign.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which granted summary judgment to DOTD.</SPAN></P>

Acts 1316. Conservationists intervened. The 19th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana found parts of the act unconstitutional, some of which findings were reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Through restrictions on the use of gill nets in the harvesting of saltwater finfish, Act 1316 impacted the availability of such fish for markets both within and outside of Louisiana. Plaintiffs argued that the public trust doctrine of La. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1 required equitable distribution of such fish among fishermen; that commercial fishermen were vested with an incorporeal right to fish using current legal harvesting methods unless biological data supported an alteration of that right; and that the act violated substantive due process, equal protection, and the commerce clause. The appellate court found that Act 1316 was the legislature's exercise of its &sect; 1 mandate. The mandates of La. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 56:638.3 - .5, part of the amended statute, were directed to the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Commission rather than to the legislature. Plaintiffs failed to show fish caught were inequitably allocated between recreational and commercial fishermen. The latter lacked a property interest in the &quot;right to fish.&quot; The incidental burden on interstate commerce of fewer finfish was not greater than the effect within state and did not outweigh the environmental protection interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Twenty-First Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Helena (Louisiana), found that appellee prospective candidate was wrongfully prohibited from seeking candidacy for election to appellant board of directors.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prospective candidate sought a nomination for election to the corporate board. She alleged that under the old by-laws, she would not have been prohibited from seeking such election, even though her marriage to a public official would otherwise have prohibited it, because she had a separate membership. However, the by-laws were later amended to provide that a married person had a joint membership and both members had to be eligible to serve. The amended by-laws were in effect when the prospective candidate sought the nomination. The by-laws stated that they could be amended at any time. The trial court ruled that the board of directors wrongfully prohibited her from seeking the nomination, and also found another individual ineligible to serve because his business primarily engaged in selling items to the corporation's members. After judgment was entered, the appellate court found she did not have a vested right to the nomination and was not wrongfully prohibited from seeking it under the amended by-laws. It further found the evidence did not show that the other individual was ineligible to serve, as he was not &quot;primarily engaged&quot; in sales to the corporation's members.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment for the prospective candidate was reversed, as was that part of the judgment finding that the only approved candidate was ineligible to serve. All of the claims of the prospective candidate were denied and were dismissed with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff State sought review of a judgment from the Civil District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), in the State's rule to make child support arrearages of defendant father executory, which held that the claim for payments more than five years in arrears prescribed. The State claimed that the action was subject to a 10-year liberative prescription and the trial court should have awarded a greater sum.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State filed a rule to make the father's child support arrearages executory. The record was unclear as to the date of the father's last payment. The trial court held that the claim for payments more than five years in arrears prescribed pursuant to La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 3497.1 (1994). The State sought review and claimed that the action was subject to a 10-year liberative prescription. The appeal record did not contain an exception of prescription, which had to be specially pleaded under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 927(B). The court held that: (1) La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 3501.1 (1997) became effective after the arrearages arose; (2) when the claim prescribed, the right to plead the exception of prescription constituted a substantive change in the law; (3) art. 3501.1 did not indicate legislative intent to apply the prescriptive period to revive a cause of action that had already prescribed; and (5) on the record, the court could not determine whether prescription was interrupted for arrearages over five years and whether that claim prescribed before the enactment of art. 3501.1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the judgment for the State in its action to make the father's child support arrearages executory insofar as it disallowed payments over five years, and remanded the cause for a determination of the date of the father's last payment and whether the claim for arrearages beyond five years prescribed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Thirteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Evangeline, State of Louisiana, granted plaintiff patient judgment in a medical malpractice case against defendants, hospital, insurance company, and hospital staff. The hospital, insurance company, and hospital staff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff patient filed a medical malpractice action against defendants, hospital, insurance company, and hospital staff, for a left leg peroneal nerve injury that occurred during her hospitalization for a total right hip replacement surgery. The trial court granted the patient judgment against the hospital staff. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in applying the res ipsa loquitur doctrine. Peroneal nerve injury on a contralateral leg was a recognized complication of hip replacement surgery. As such, this fact could not be discounted by the trial court as a possible cause of the injury. Patient's proof did not rebut this fact, and she could not do so in view of her experts' agreement that it was true. In finding liability, the trial court held the hospital vicariously liable for its employees' conduct. Regardless, the court found the record contained sufficient evidence of fault and affirmed the judgment, but modified and remanded for assignment of fault and determination of the constitutionality of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2323, which allowed non-parties to be held at fault.</SPAN></P>

The record contained no evidence of a continuous relationship between the child and defendants. Medical records submitted by the parents showed that the child was an inpatient for the 1985 surgery and that she returned to the hospital in 1993 and 1994. The consequence of the surgery did not physically manifest until the child reached puberty more than eight years after removal of the breast tissue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">By resolution, the police jury had approved an agreement whereby riverboats paid a fixed amount in lieu of a per person boarding fee and in lieu of any future legislative modifications regarding distribution of riverboat gaming revenue in return for a $ 300,000 annual payment from each boat. Thereafter, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4:552 (now &sect; 27:93) was amended to authorize a $ .50 admission fee. This additional $ .50 was allocated to go to the parish road fund. The trial court found that the amendment that authorized the $ .50 boarding fee was not a special or local law and that it would be against public policy to allow the police jury to enter into a binding agreement restricting and preventing the legislature from, in the future, granting them the authority to assess a fee. On appeal, the court affirmed that part of the judgment but disagreed with the finding that the police jury, rather than city, was the &quot;local governing authority&quot; authorized to impose the $ .50 admission fee. The court found that under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4:552, the legislature authorized the &quot;local governing authority&quot; of the parish or municipality where a riverboat was berthed to charge an admission fee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment in favor of the police jury and rendered judgment in favor of the riverboats, declaring that the ordinance of the police jury imposing a $ .50 per person admission fee was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commission conducted an investigation into allegations that the employee had possibly committed violations of the Code of Governmental Ethics. The employee signed a consent agreement and agreed to pay the fine imposed by the commission. The employee filed a petition with the trial court for alleged damages that resulted from the commission's adverse decision. The trial court found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the employee's claim. The employee appealed and argued that his original and amended petitions specifically challenged the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:1141(C)(2) and not just the procedural actions taken by the commission. The court held that when the commission decided to accept the consent agreement and to dispense with the public hearing, the arguments raised by the employee were no longer at issue and were rendered moot. The court concluded that the employee's complaint was based solely on the administrative and procedural actions taken by the commission and that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:1142 provided for the correct forum for the employee's appeal, which was not with the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1981, the patient received a blood transfusion at the medical center. In 1992, the patient learned that she suffered from Hepatitis C, the source of which was the blood transfusion. The patient and her husband brought a medical malpractice action against the medical center. The medical center filed a peremptory exception of prescription on the basis that the medical malpractice prescription statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628, barred the claim. The trial court sustained the exception and appellants sought review. The court affirmed. The court rejected appellants' claim that their action sounded in products liability, rather than medical malpractice, and was not barred by the medical malpractice statute of limitations. The court found that the Medical Malpractice Act was amended in 1976 to include actions for injuries incurred as the result of receiving transfusions of contaminated blood products. Because the patient's transfusion took place after 1976, her claim was one for medical malpractice. As a result of the amendment, the court said, appellants' claims were subject to all of the special provisions of the Act, including the prescriptive period.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:43.5.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed a motion to quash the bill of information on the ground that &sect; 14:43.5 was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court denied the motion, and defendant was convicted of violating the statute. In affirming, the court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 14:43.5 was unconstitutionally vague on the ground that it penalized the intentional exposure of another to the &quot;AIDS virus&quot; where there was no such thing as an AIDS virus. The court noted that the defense's expert admitted that he had heard the term &quot;AIDS virus&quot; used even though there was a distinction between the HIV virus and AIDS. The court held that the language of the statute was not vague because it communicated that its intent was to criminalize the intentional transmission of the virus that caused AIDS. Moreover, the court held that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intentionally exposed the victim to the virus that caused AIDS through sexual contact and without her knowledge or lawful consent. The evidence showed that defendant signed a form acknowledging that he was HIV-positive, but never told the victim about it during their sexual relationship that post-dated the acknowledgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At a hearing, counsel for the juvenile stipulated as to probable cause. At that hearing the assistant district attorney informed the trial court that the matter was being considered for transfer to Criminal District Court where the defendant, a 15 year old juvenile, would be prosecuted as an adult. At his arraignment, defendant pleaded not guilty. Defense counsel filed a motion to quash the bill of information and after a hearing, and the trial court granted the motion to quash, ordering the matter transferred to juvenile court. The state objected and subsequently made unsuccessful applications for writs three times and filed an appeal. Defendant contended that the state failed to give proper notice to defendant and his parents regarding its intent to try defendant as a adult, and had no authority to do so. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the trial court's order quashing the information, finding that pursuant to La. Child Code arts. 305, 857 and 858, the district attorney was &quot;expressly empowered&quot; with &quot;complete discretion&quot; to file a bill of information in criminal court or a petition in juvenile court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

She filed a claim for workers' compensation benefits contending that she was temporarily totally disabled. At trial, she testified that she had not worked since she left the employer. The worker's compensation judge dismissed the employee's claim because she failed to disclose that she was working as a sitter. The court affirmed and held that the judge did not err in ordering forfeiture of the employee's benefits pursuant to &sect; 23:1208(E). Although the employee testified that she did not work for anyone, her own rebuttal witness testified that she was paying the employee to care for her children everyday. That had been going on for the entire year before the trial. The employee's testimony demonstrated that she had no difficulty understanding the questions put to her. The judge had the opportunity to observe her at close hand and was in a unique position to conclude that she was intentionally concealing the fact that she had the ability to do some work and was in fact gainfully employed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction stemmed his snatching money from the hand of a cashier at a restaurant's drive-up window.

Defendant also complained that the trial court erred in refusing his requested jury charge regarding simple robbery and improperly instructed the jury as to the elements of simple robbery. Finally, defendant complained that his life sentence was constitutionally excessive. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction, but vacated his sentenced and remanded for resentencing. The state proved the essential elements of the offense because the victim testified that he was intimidated by defendant. The trial court properly instructed the jury on the elements of simple robbery and defendant's requested charge was sufficiently included in the general charge. The trial judge imposed an illegal sentence on defendant, in violation of the Ex Post Facto clause, by sentencing defendant under a version of the multiple offender statute that did not become effective until after defendant committed the simple robbery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, State of Louisiana in favor of the State of Louisiana, after a jury verdict, which convicted him of armed robbery, under La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14:64, and sentenced him to 17 years at hard labor with 7 years to be served without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. The district court denied defendant's motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a juvenile, had been tried as an adult. Defendant's trial counsel had not appeared at the hearing on his motion to reconsider the sentence. On appeal, the court held that since the record did not show that defendant's mother had prevented him from entering into a plea bargain that he had wanted, it could not consider that issue on appeal. The court found that defendant's excessive sentence claim had been preserved by filing the motion to reconsider the sentence, pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881.1(D). Thus, the court held that there had been no prejudice from his counsel's failure to appear and his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was without merit. The court found that it was error, under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 873, for the trial judge to impose the sentence less than 24 hours after denying the motion for a new trial, since defendant had not waived the statutory delay period. Even though the conviction for armed robbery carried a mandatory prison sentence, the court noted that the trial judge still had to determine the number of years to be imposed. Thus, the court held defendant had been prejudiced by the early imposition of the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the district court's judgment in favor of the State, which had convicted defendant of armed robbery, but reversed defendant's sentence and remanded for re-sentencing.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge found that the employee was in the course and scope of his employment when abducted. The court affirmed and amended the judgment. Close calls in workers' compensation cases were usually made in favor of the employee. The court could not say that the judgment was manifestly wrong in finding that the employee's work place, considering all relevant aspects and particulars, extended to the parking lot. The threshold doctrine was an exception to the general rule that when an employee was traveling to and from work he was not covered by workers' compensation. The threshold doctrine was properly applied when an accident occurred at a place with an unusually hazardous travel risk which was immediately adjacent to, but not on, the employer's premises. The court amended the judgment to include an award for burial expenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The department sought a declaratory judgment that Civil Service Rules 1.14.1, 13.10(c), 13.10(e), 13.10(h), 13.10(k), 13.10(1), and 14.1(a) were unconstitutional insofar as they purported to authorize a right of appeal from discrimination other than discrimination based upon a classified employee's political or religious beliefs, sex or race, as provided in La. Const. art. X. The commission asserted that it was given broad authority for the administration and regulation of the state classified service under art. X, and the district court granted the commission's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed the summary dismissal of the petition. The court held that La. Const. art. X, &sect; 8(B) did not provide an exclusive listing of bases for civil service appeals based on discrimination because district courts would be precluded from entertaining discrimination claims under La. Const. art. X, which would thwart the entire civil service scheme. At most, La. Const. art. X, &sect; 8(B) guaranteed a constitutional right to appeal in its listed discriminations. The commission had the power to expand prohibited discrimination under the broad and general rule-making power.</SPAN></P>

The grandson asserted that because his mother had been disinherited and he was the only grandchild, he was entitled to inherit in his own right as the nearest heir in the direct line of descendants. The court found that the trial court was correct when it determined that the grandson was not a forced heir. The court found that La. Civ.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Third party plaintiff sellers challenged a judgment of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, State of Louisiana, which granted a summary judgment in favor of third party defendant City of Zachary and dismissed the City. The sellers urged that the immunity granted in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:4771 was barred by the Louisiana Constitution as it existed prior to 1995.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff buyers filed an action against the sellers, seeking damages on the basis that water leakage from the attic of their home rendered it materially defective and substandard. The sellers filed a third party demand against the City alleging that any liability owed to the buyers arose out of the City's failure to perform its regular duty to inspect and grant a building permit in accordance with 1992 proper standards. The City filed a motion for summary judgment. It asserted that pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 33:4771, 33:4773, it was immune from liability. It relied on the theory that the 1995 amendment to the Louisiana Constitutional provision regarding sovereign immunity was curative of any constitutional infirmity in &sect; 33:4771 et seq and the statute referred to therein. The district court granted the motion and dismissed the City. On appeal, the court found it unnecessary and improper to address the constitutional issue and affirmed. The plain wording of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 33 and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:4773(D) made it clear that the sellers did not and could not state a cause of action against the City for any act of the building inspector.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff prisoner appealed the judgment from the 22nd Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of St. Tammany (Louisiana), which, in three consolidated cases, dismissed his petitions for writs of mandamus and civil penalties against defendant sheriff in the prisoner's actions, which sought radio logs, photographs, and employment records of former employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoner filed the petitions to obtain the radio logs, the photographs, and the termination or retirement records of the department's former employees. After the trial court dismissed the petitions, the prisoner appealed. The court reversed the dismissal for the records and reinstated a judgment that granted access to the records. The prisoner sufficiently raised the exception of res judicata in his objection to the consolidation. The consolidation was improper. The matter became final when no appeal was taken from the judgment that granted access to the records. The court affirmed the dismissal for the radio logs and the photographs. The denial of the claim for the radio logs under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:31.1 did not violate either the equal protection clause or due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The prisoner did prove that the state had no appropriate governmental interest in the photographs. The trial court was correct in determining that &sect; 44:31.1, as applied to the photographs, was not an unconstitutional violation of Article I, Section 3 of the Louisiana Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the Louisiana Gaming Control Board and Louisiana State Police, Riverboat Gaming Enforcement Division, sought review of a decision of the 19th Judicial District Court Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, that reversed decisions of the Division and Board not to renew appellant applicant's permit to work as a non-key gaming employee with a riverboat casino pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27:76(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The renewal application was denied because the applicant had pleaded guilty to an offense punishable by imprisonment for a period of more than one year and was a person whose prior activities and criminal record posed a threat to the effective regulation and control of gaming. On appeal from the Board's decision, the trial court concluded that as a result of a first offender pardon, the applicant's first offense felony conviction ceased to exist and that he was therefore, not rendered ineligible for a permit by &sect; 27:76(3). On appeal from that decision, the court found that &sect; 27:76(3) provided that the Division could not award a permit to any person disqualified on the basis of a prior felony conviction. The applicant argued that pursuant to La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, his citizenship rights were restored after he was automatically pardoned for his first offense pursuant to La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 5(E)(1). In reversing the trial court, the court held that despite his first offender pardon, the historical fact of the applicant's felony conviction was extant and that the legislature's clear intent was to deny a permit to anyone convicted of even one felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and reinstated the Board's decision not to renew the applicant's gaming permit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from an order of the 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which entered judgment of her conviction for distribution of cocaine, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967A, and which sentenced her as a second offender to 25 years at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. Defendant also filed a motion to strike portions of the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a sanity hearing, defendant was found competent to stand trial on a charge of distribution of cocaine, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967A. Defendant's motion to quash the information, based upon alleged government misconduct, and her motion to suppress, were denied. Defendant was found guilty as charged and sentenced as a second offender to 25 years at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. In affirming the judgment, the court held that defendant's motion to quash was properly denied because the evidence demonstrated the she was an active participant in the criminal activity, and thus could not avail herself to the defense of government misconduct. The court held that defendant could not have proven an entrapment defense because a rational trier of fact could have found that defendant was not sufficiently induced to buy cocaine and that she was predisposed to commit the offense. The court amended defendant's sentence to conform with the statute under which she was convicted, which specified at La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(B)(4)(b) that only the first five years of the sentence was to be served without parole eligibility.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court amended defendant's sentence to reflect that only the first five years of her sentence were to be served without parole eligibility, and then affirmed the sentence as amended.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff relators sought review of a decision of the Civil District Court, for the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which ruled that that La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The relators asserted a medical malpractice action against the hospital alleging that their daughter was transfused with HIV-infected blood while a patient. The hospital filed an exception of prescription pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9:5628.

On appeal, the relators complained that the trial court erred in concluding that &sect; 9:5628 did not discriminate on the basis of physical condition and in placing the burden of proving the statute's unconstitutionality on them. The court articulated the presumption that statutes were constitutional and the rule that the burden of proving unconstitutionality rested upon the party challenging the validity of the statute. The court found that &sect; 9:5628 did not classify individuals according to physical condition and affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court's judgment and denied the stepfather's petition for intrafamily adoption. The court held (1) that the trial court did not err in finding that the father had lost the right to object to an intrafamily adoption due to his failure to support the child, as the record reflected that the father had adequate income to pay child support and did not and that the father knew where the mother was and still did not send support; and (2) that the trial court erred in finding that an intrafamily adoption by the stepfather was in the child's best interest, as it was clear that a natural parent relationship existed and the father's failure to visit the child was justified due to the resistance of the mother.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The offenses were allegedly committed during defendant's tenure as a state trooper. The State claimed that the trial court erred in disregarding the mandatory language of La. Code Crim. Proc.

The court found that the grant of use plus derivative use immunity by the investigators to defendant was binding on the prosecutor, but that quashing the indictments was not the appropriate mechanism for enforcing the immunity agreement. The court reversed the trial court's order because art. 442 prohibited dismissing the indictments on the grounds that they were based in whole or in part on illegal evidence. The court ruled that the statements likely would have been considered illegal evidence at trial because defendant had been compelled to give them by threat of termination and they had been given in exchange for a promise of use plus derivative use immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was originally charged with DWI, fourth offense, to which he pled not guilty and sought to quash the predicate offenses. The trial court quashed only one, and defendant pled guilty to DWI, third offense, reserving his right to appeal. The court affirmed, finding first, that the motion to quash the other two predicate offenses was properly denied because they were properly filed, and the affidavits were legally sufficient and not defective. Although the court clerks who received the filings were improperly sworn in, they were nonetheless de facto public officers. Thus, their acts had the same validity as de jure officers and could not be collaterally attacked by third persons. Second, defendant's allegation that Monroe, La., City Code &sect; 33-10, under which defendant was charged, was invalid because it was inconsistent with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:98, which required that third and subsequent DWI offenses had to be charged under state law, was without merit because the DWI ordinance was valid and substantially consistent with &sect; 14:98. Third, defendant's sentence was not excessive under La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20 because it was not grossly disproportionate to the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant offered the victim a ride and when she accepted, he held her in the back of his truck and raped her, until she managed to break free and run to safety.

In return for a guilty plea, defendant was convicted of second degree kidnapping, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:44.1. Defendant received the maximum sentence for second degree kidnapping. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that venue was proper under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 611, 612 because at least one element of the crime was committed within the jurisdiction. The court further found that defendant intended to force the victim to acquiesce in exchange for safety where defendant conveyed to the victim that she would be killed if she tried to get away, manifesting defendant's intent to force her to give in to his demands with the hope of securing her safe release. The court concluded that defendant's sentence did not shock the sense of justice in view of the benefit the defendant received by pleading guilty to a lesser charge and thus avoiding a longer sentence and defendant's prior criminal history.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the mandatory sentence was not grossly out of proportion to the gravity of the conduct and that the juvenile court failed to articulate sufficient rationale that defendant's case was a truly &quot;rare case&quot; that warranted the exceptional declaration of unconstitutionality. The court noted that while the victim may have &quot;initiated&quot; the encounter, she was not capable of consent. Although defendant had no juvenile felony record, he did have a prior adjudication for simple battery that involved an element of sexual battery, and he had extensive behavioral problems at school. Overall the court did not find that the imposition of juvenile life would have made no measurable contribution to defendant's rehabilitation or that it would have been a needless and purposeless infliction of pain and suffering.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff student was arrested following the discovery of marijuana in his dormitory room. The discovery was made pursuant to defendant university's random dormitory search policy. Plaintiff subsequently filed an action seeking damages and an injunction against defendant. The trial court declared defendant's search policy was prima facie unconstitutional and also dismissed a number of defendants and denied plaintiff's discovery motions and request for sanctions. Upon appeal by both parties, the court affirmed. The court held that the dormitory search policy was prima facie unconstitutional where defendant failed to show that the policy furthered its functioning as an educational institution. The court noted that checks of dormitory rooms for health hazards were permissible as were searches in emergencies. However, defendant did not specify such a purpose; rather it allowed entry of dormitory rooms accompanied by police without any stated purpose. The court found defendant's attorney was properly dismissed as a party because the attorney had no involvement in the actions of which plaintiff complained and his only connection with the case was his representation of defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs filed a petition for damages against defendants, a newspaper and others, for damages allegedly sustained by the publication and/or dissemination of the contents of and allegedly illegally intercepted communication between them. The Twelfth Judicial District Court, Parish of Avoyelles, State of Louisiana granted the newspaper's exception of no cause of action. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The newspaper's exception of no cause of action contended that the Electronic Surveillance Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1301 et seq., did not bar the publication or broadcast of an allegedly illegally intercepted telephone conversation that had already been disclosed. On appeal, plaintiffs argued that: (1) trial court erred in dismissing their claims against the newspaper after finding that the literal interpretation of the Act supported a cause of action; and (2) the trial court erred in finding that to apply the Act in the case would have been unconstitutional. Upon review, the court held that the consideration of the constitutionality of the Act by the trial court was erroneous and that plaintiffs' petitions stated a cause of action. Because none of the procedures for considering the constitutionality of the Act were observed, and the Act did not interfere with or curtail the plenary powers vested in the trial court by the Louisiana Constitution, the issue of constitutionality was not in proper posture for consideration.In addition, the allegations of plaintiffs' petitions, when accepted as true, supported a cause of action under the literal language of the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decision sustaining the newspaper's exception of no cause of action is reversed and the matter was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The clients filed an action against the attorney because the attorney failed to timely file suit against the state for arrearages. The attorney filed an exception of prescription/peremption. The trial court found in favor of the clients and ordered the attorney to pay the arrearages. The attorney appealed. While the matter was pending on appeal, the state supreme court handed down a decision, which was dispositive of the prescriptive/peremptive defense issue raised by the attorney, but not addressed by the trial court. Thereafter, the clients filed a motion with the court seeking a remand so that they could challenge the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5605. The attorney opposed, arguing that the clients never asserted any constitutional arguments at the trial level and, therefore, those issues could not be raised for the first time on appeal. However, the court determined that in the light of the law's liberal approach toward allowing amended pleadings in order to promote the interests of justice, remand was proper in order to allow the clients to amend their pleadings to assert that their claim was not perempted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During the mother's pregnancy, she requested amniocentesis to screen for possible birth defects. The doctor originally said the test was normal but later said it was not and requested blood tests from both parents. The parents were advised during the 23rd week of gestation that there was a significant risk that the child would be born with a birth defect. The baby was later born with a chromosomal abnormality. The parents filed a wrongful birth action against defendants, claiming that if they had been advised earlier, they would have aborted the baby. The trial court granted defendants summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that although La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.35.4(A) prohibited a doctor from performing an abortion of a viable fetus, the medical testimony supported defendants' contention that the option of an abortion was just as available at 23 weeks as it was at 16 weeks. The court held that defendants had met their burden of offering uncontroverted evidence that no genuine issue of fact material to the question of whether their alleged delay in notifying the parents of the risk of a birth defect caused the parents to choose to continue the pregnancy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The worker's compensation recipient was receiving benefits for a knee injury, but the benefits were discontinued when he became incarcerated.

The worker's compensation office awarded temporary total disability benefits in the amount of $ 243 per month to the grandchild based on a finding that he was a dependent, and the employer appealed.

The grandchild's guardian did present evidence that the worker's compensation recipient, as the grandfather, had contributed to the grandchild's support, although it was sporadic.

The court reversed the district court's judgment upholding the State and museum's exception of no cause of action and the court concluded that the commission had jurisdiction over state-owned buildings within the historical section of New Orleans. The court found that La. Const. art. 14, &sect; 22A applied to any building in the historical section due to the need for uniformity to retain the beauty of the section as a whole. The court held that requiring the State to comply with the commission's permit procedure did not abridge the State's police power. The court found that the commission and the State museum had distinct powers and the commission ordinance and that State museum statute were not incompatible and could be effectuated in harmony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the district court's judgment maintaining the museum's peremptory exception of no cause of action and the court concluded that the commission could seek any and all remedies that arose out of its inability to secure a preliminary injunction which sought to prevent the museum from constructing a fence around the building.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff filed an action objecting to defendant's candidacy for mayor. The trial court held that defendant was disqualified as a candidate for the office of mayor. Defendant appealed and the court found defendant did not meet the qualifications for the office of the mayor of a certain city and that he did not actually reside at the home at issue. The court found it difficult to believe that a family of four could spend the majority of their time, including most nights in a home, and use very limited utilities although the home contained an electric stove, electric refrigerator, freezer, television, and other electrical items. The court concluded that the utility bills easily inferred that defendant's family was not actually residing at the residence at issue the majority of the time. The testimony of defendant and a certain letter showed that defendant's main intent was to qualify the residence as his political domicile. Proof of defendant's intention to change domicile depended upon the circumstances because there was no declaration to change domicile. The trial court was not clearly wrong in finding that defendant's domicile had not changed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient filed the lawsuit against the doctor for damages resulting from his failure to remove a catheter following chemotherapy treatment. The doctor filed an exception of prescription claiming that the patient's action had prescribed on its face. The issues on appeal were whether the doctor's conduct constituted a continuing tort so that the three year prescriptive period established by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628 did not begin to run until long after the initial tort and whether the statute was unconstitutional. In an effort to overcome the three year prescription the patient argued that the doctor's continuing failure to discover that a part of the catheter was left in her body constituted a continuing tort until January 1995 when she last saw the doctor. The court found that the record did not support the application of the continuing tort doctrine to the patient's case. The patient presented no evidence that the doctor knew about the faulty removal of the catheter in June 1991, or that he should have known about it. The patient did not properly raise the issue of the constitutionality of &sect; 9:5628.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff voters appealed an order of the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which dismissed their petition for a writ of mandamus against defendant city council members to compel them to call an election on a Home Rule Charter of the city to provide for a local minimum wage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The voters filed a petition for a writ of mandamus against the city council members to compel them to call an election on a proposed amendment to the Home Rule Charter of the city to provide for a local minimum wage. The state legislature passed La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:642, which prohibited a local government from establishing a minimum wage, during the pendency of the voters' suit. The trial court then dismissed the voters' suit because the proposed election was to have been held after the effective date of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:642, and thus the issue of whether to provide for a local minimum wage was moot. The voters appealed, arguing that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:642 was patently unconstitutional. The court held that the constitutionality of a statute must have been questioned first in the trial court, and the constitutionality of statute must have been specially pleaded and grounds for the claim particularized. In proceedings in which the constitutionality of a statute was questioned the attorney general should have been served with notice. The constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:642 was not presented to or considered by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order of the trial court denying the voters' application for a writ of mandamus. However, this portion of the judgment was vacated and the case remanded to the trial court to allow the voters to specifically plead the unconstitutionality of a statute prohibiting a local government from establishing a minimum wage, to notify the state attorney general, and to allow for the issue of constitutionality to be fully litigated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Officers observed defendant standing next to a vehicle in the middle of the street. Defendant fled and was eventually apprehended. The officers testified that they observed defendant attempting to reach in his pocket.

He retrieved the matchbox, opened it, and discovered an off-white material, which field-tested positive for cocaine. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. Specifically, he argued that the officers did not have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity to justify the initial stop, nor did the officer have an articulable belief that he was in danger so as to justify the subsequent pat down. The court found that the investigatory stop and initial frisk were legal, but held that the opening of the matchbox by the officer exceeded the permissible bounds of a reasonable search. The officer was only permitted to pat down defendant's clothing to detect hidden weapons to protect himself and others from a potentially armed and dangerous suspect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was 32 and the victim was 16 when defendant attempted have sex with the victim. Defendant was convicted of indecent behavior with a juvenile and sentenced to seven years at hard labor, the maximum penalty. On appeal, defendant argued that admission of evidence of his attempt to have sex with a minor when he was 21 was error. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court was unaware of any reported Louisiana opinions saying that events occurring 14 or 15 years before a trial could not be acceptable evidence against a charged defendant only because of the time element. Accordingly, there was no error. The court, however, agreed that defendant's sentence was excessive. The court held that maximum sentences were appropriate only in cases involving the most serious violations of the statute and the worse type of offender. The facts and circumstances did not justify a maximum seven-year sentence. The maximum was disproportionate to the realities of the crime and was an abuse of discretion. A lesser sentence would not deprecate the seriousness of defendant's behavior. The court remanded for sentencing.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1244(A)(1). He was sentenced to three years at hard labor with credit for time served.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed a motion to quash pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 531, alleging that all of the evidence against him was illegally seized from his attorney's office in violation of his attorney-client privilege. The trial judge denied the motion to quash. The court held that there was no showing by defendant of a privileged communication between defendant and his attorney that was used at trial. Defendant also contended that his insurance claims for property damage and personal injury were legitimate and as such showed that he lacked the requisite intent to defraud. The court disagreed based on a clear reading of the statute.  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1244(1) required that defendant knowingly caused or participated in a vehicular collision for the purpose of presenting any false or fraudulent claim. Finally, defendant complained that his sentence of three years imprisonment at hard labor was excessive. In imposing the sentence, the trial court considered the provisions of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 and aggravating and mitigating factors. The court found no abuse of the trial court's wide discretion to sentence within statutory limits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state proved through the testimony of three teenaged girls that defendant showed them pornographic video tapes, called porno movies, in his home. The court affirmed the convictions. The court rejected defendant's argument that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:91.11 pertained only to activity at a newsstand or other commercial establishment, not to videos shown in residences. The clear legislative intent was to make it a crime for anyone over 17 to sell, exhibit or distribute obscene material to persons under 17 at a commercial establishment and everywhere else. Statutes were presumed valid and their constitutionality was to be upheld whenever possible. The court found that &sect; 14: 91.11 gave adequate notice of what was prohibited and which standards were to be used in determining guilt or innocence. The court held that if the defense had prior notice of the State's intent to introduce a statement and the statement was properly admitted later, the prosecutor's premature mention of the statement in its opening statement to the jury caused no prejudice. The court held that a deputy's statement to which defendant assigned error was admitted during the trial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant escaped from a holding area in the courthouse by climbing out of a window. After serving time in another state, defendant was extradited back to Louisiana. A charge of simple escape was added to other charges already pending against defendant. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in finding that he had waived his right to counsel, failing to advise him of the dangers of self-representation, and failing to provide him with stand-by counsel. Defendant also challenged the sufficiency of the evidence for his simple escape conviction and habitual offender adjudication. Finally, defendant argued that his sentence should not have been enlarged by application of the habitual offender law, and that his sentence was excessive. The court rejected these contentions and affirmed. Defendant understood his right to counsel and consciously chose not to accept court-appointed counsel. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's simple escape conviction. The trial court did not err in adjudicating defendant a habitual offender and accordingly enlarging defendant's original sentence. Based on his criminal record, defendant's sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for simple escape and his sentence to 20 years at hard labor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board of Ethics appealed a preliminary injunction granted in favor of the senator restraining it from taking any action against the senator. The senator alleged in an action against the Board that it had no authority to proceed against him. In a supplemental petition, the senator alleged that the Board's makeup violated La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:1132 because it was not &quot;representative of the state's population as near as practicable.&quot; The court disagreed and reversed. The court held that it was unable to discern what the legislature intended with the questioned phraseology. It was unclear what the makeup of the Board was supposed to be. The legislature did not definitively proscribe the membership of the Board. The court therefore refused to intervene between the two political branches of government to determine that the legislature intended the membership of the Board to correspond numerically to the population makeup of the state along racial and gender lines. The senator's action was an impermissible collateral attack on the right to office of the Board members under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 42:76-77.</SPAN></P>

In recomputing his sentence, defendant was not credited for good time credit he had earned prior to resentencing. He filed suit to receive his good time credit and the trial court found that he was ineligible for the good time credits. On appeal, the court affirmed because under the clear language of &sect; 15:571.3, which was in effect when defendant committed the instant offence, defendant was not eligible to earn diminution of his sentence through good time credit. The Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections had no discretion in the matter to allow defendant to earn the good time credits and it had the right to correct the error it made in application of the statutory law governing good time eligibility to take away good time credits which it had no statutory authority to award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sold $ 30 of heroin to an undercover police officer. Defendant was found guilty by a jury of distribution of heroin in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. art. 40:966(A). The trial court entered a judgment of conviction and imposed a mandatory life imprisonment sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed. First, the court held that defendant was procedurally barred from challenging his sentence pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881.1. The court also held that defendant's sentence was not constitutionally excessive. Next, the court rejected defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Because the sentence was reviewed and not found to be excessive, defendant was not prejudiced by counsel's failure to object to the sentence or his failure to file a motion to reconsider the sentence. Finally, defendant did not show that he was prejudiced by the trial court's failure to observe a 24-hour delay in sentencing required by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 873. Because the life sentence was mandatory, no prejudice could possibly have resulted from the failure of the trial court to comply with the delay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant relator appealed a judgment of the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans, Division N (Louisiana), which denied its motion for summary judgment against plaintiff injured parties in a negligence action between residents of different states. The relator claimed that the trial court erred in ruling that because the rental agreement was entered into in Florida, Florida law applied to the Louisiana accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injured parties, Louisiana residents, had an accident in Louisiana with a car that was owned by the relator, a Florida car rental company, and driven by a Florida resident. In the injured parties' negligence action, the trial court denied the relator's motion for summary judgment on the ground that Florida law applied, which was more advantageous to the injured parties. The court reversed the judgment and dismissed the complaint against the relator, ruling that the because the accident occurred in Louisiana, Louisiana's standard of care applied. Under both La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 3515, the general conflict of law statute, and La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 3542, Louisiana had the greatest relationship to the action, and its policies would have been most seriously impaired if its law were not applied. In Louisiana a self-insured rental car company had the right to limit operation of its vehicles to only those individuals to whom it gave express permission, those who were listed as authorized drivers in the rental agreement. The driver of the vehicle was not a party to the contract but was an unauthorized operator, and the contract absolved the relator from liability for such operation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, which had denied the relator's motion for summary judgment in the action against it by the injured parties. The court also rendered judgment in favor of the relator, dismissing the injured parties' complaint against the relator with prejudice, and it remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Complications in the birth of the parents' baby left her profoundly brain damaged. The parents filed a medical malpractice suit against the hospital and the doctor. The father's employer intervened to obtain reimbursement for funds it paid on behalf of the baby. The trial court held that the employer had no cause of action and dismissed it from the case. The trial court directed a verdict in favor of the hospital, and the jury found in favor of the doctor. On appeal, the court reversed in part and affirmed in part. The court held that neither it nor the trial court had jurisdiction to decide the employer's subrogation rights because that issue fell under the auspices of the federal court. It was error for the trial court to grant a directed verdict in favor of the hospital because reasonable and fair-minded people could have found the hospital was negligent. There was no error in finding the parents' expert did not establish the standard of care applicable to the doctor. The jury instructions accurately reflected the applicable malpractice law. The jury instructions on informed consent were proper.</SPAN></P>

On appeal the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the title of the Act was plainly clear and did not suggest that the body there of would or should have been limited to state supplemental salary payments. The court stated that the department failed to show specifically how the Act impaired contracts between itself and the parish. The court found no showing that the Act caused an oppressive impairment as suggested by the department. The court noted that the Act sought to further a fairly apparent general state interest of providing better fire protection. The court held that the act did not deprive the department of equal protection and was neither arbitrary nor capricious but was a legislative response to the attorney general's previous opinion saying that supplemental pay to volunteer firemen was illegal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Although the accident occurred in Louisiana and the tortfeasor was a Louisiana resident, the claimant and the uninsured motorist insurer were from out of state. The trial court applied Louisiana on the basis of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1406(D)(1)(a)(iii). The court found that Georgia law should have been applied to the uninsured motorist policy. The court utilized a conflict of law analysis and determined that where the uninsured motorist policy complied with Georgia law, the negotiation, selection of benefits, issuance, and delivery of the policy occurred entirely outside the State of Louisiana, and neither the insured nor the uninsured motorist insurer maintained any offices, terminals, or employees in Louisiana, the trial court should have applied Georgia law. The fact that the accident occurred in Louisiana and that the tortfeasor was a Louisiana resident was not enough to warrant application of Louisiana law. Georgia had a compelling interest in regulating insurance policies issued to its residents and in seeing that the expectations of the parties to the policies issued were upheld. Louisiana had no compelling interest in overriding Georgia law in this case.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the two criminal acts did not contain identical elements and that neither offense was a lesser-included offense of the other. The court stated that double jeopardy did not attach because the two offenses each required proof of an additional element that the other did not. The court noted that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in the imposition of defendant's sentence. The court found that the sentence was based upon defendant's prior criminal record and the fact that he had been offered probation previously for those other crimes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On Certiorari to the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), which granted defendants' motion to suppress statements made to state legislative auditors in an action charging defendants with theft of $ 500 dollars or more belonging to the State of Louisiana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were toll collectors and were charged with theft after an investigation uncovered a scheme whereby defendants would deliberately misclassify revenue vehicles as non-revenue vehicles and then pocket the money they collected. Defendants were interviewed concerning the investigation by a state auditor. The trial court determined that state auditors were state actors and that because the auditors failed to give defendants their Miranda warnings prior to the interviews the statements were inadmissible. The court concluded that the trial court erred. Defendants were not in custody for purposes of the Miranda warnings because they were not under arrest and were free to leave at any time. Further, Miranda warnings were necessary only when a confession was made to a state actor. The court concluded that state auditors were not actors. Auditors were not law enforcement officers and did not function as such. The court remanded for a determination of voluntariness of defendants' statements under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:451, a statute that required confessions to be given voluntarily, regardless of who they were given to, before they could be submitted into evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that the trial court erred in granting defendants' motions to suppress statements made to state legislative auditors in an action charging defendants with theft of five hundred dollars or more belonging to the State of Louisiana, but remanded the action to consider the voluntariness of the statements.</SPAN></P>

Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315 and its challenge to the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4:525(A), following the denial of its gambling license application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicants' application for a gambling license was denied by the state. The applicant alleged that the state's denial violated the applicants' rights. The applicants alleged that the state departed from its uniform evaluation process and utilized a ranking scheme. The trial court found that one of the state's agents was entitled to qualified immunity, but overruled the exception of no cause of action. The court affirmed. The court rejected the applicants' contention that the question of qualified immunity could only be resolved in the context of review of summary judgments. The applicants' complaint alleged sufficient facts to assert that the state violated a clearly established right of which a reasonable person would have known and, therefore stated a cause of action. Thus, the pleading set forth sufficient facts to survive the exception of no cause of action based on qualified immunity as claimed by one of the state's agents. The state's discretionary acts defense was inapplicable to conduct that involved violation of the Louisiana Riverboat Economic Development and Gaming Control Act, LSA-R.S. 27:41 et seq., because that Act did not provide for discretion.</SPAN></P>

The employee filed an action seeking a judgment declaring that statute unconstitutional. The employer filed an exception of lack of subject matter jurisdiction, contending the Office of Workers' Compensation hearing officers were vested with original exclusive jurisdiction over all claims or disputes arising out of workers' compensation matters. The trial court agreed, granted the employer's exception, and dismissed the employee's action.

The court held that the district court's decision precluding the employer and insurer from participating in the trial on the merits was not an unconstitutional application of La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant confessed to aggravated oral sexual battery and sexual battery of an eight year old victim.

He filed a motion to reconsider the sentence, which was denied, and he appealed. On review, the court held that prior to imposing the sentence, the trial court reviewed a presentence investigation report and set forth extensive reasons for the sentences imposed. Thus, it adequately followed the statutory guidelines. The trial court's articulation of reasons were adequate and did not constitute an abuse of discretion. The sentence was tailored to the offender and the offense and was not unconstitutionally excessive. Yet the application of La. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Twelfth Judicial District Court, Parish of Avoyelles (Louisiana), which convicted him on two counts of simple burglary in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in ordering his sentences to be served consecutively because the two burglaries showed a common scheme or plan. The court rejected this contention and affirmed defendant's conviction, finding that the two offenses were not part of the same transaction or part of a common scheme or plan. The court found the offenses involved different victims and occurred almost a month apart and appeared sufficiently separate and distinct to justify consecutive sentences. However, despite the fact that defendant's individual sentences appeared to be legally sound, the court found that their combined effect might make them disproportionate to the crimes committed because the 48-year combined sentence would effectively span the remainder of defendant's life. The court concluded that the 48-year combined sentence was not proportionate to the crimes committed and that it constituted a manifest abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court. Therefore, the court reversed defendant's sentences and remanded to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had complied with the applicable sentencing statutes. The sentencing range for &sect; 14:95.1 was 10 to 15 years without parole or probation; because defendant was convicted of attempted possession, his sentence could be up to one-half of the longest sentence prescribed for the offense attempted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company challenged the validity of a rule adopted by the gaming control board on constitutional, procedural, and statutory grounds. The trial court overruled the state's exception of prematurity. On the state's petition for a supervisory writ, the court granted the writ, in part, and denied it, in part. The court determined that to the extent that the company raised constitutional challenges to the rule, the board was not authorized to decide those issues. Accordingly, the court found that the trial court correctly denied the state's exception of prematurity as to those claims. The court further observed that the legislative delegation of power in the Louisiana Gaming Control Law did not violate the separation of powers. The court concluded that the Louisiana Gaming Control Board Haring Office was the proper forum to raise issues regarding the procedural and statutory challenges to the rule. The court found that because the company was entitled to a hearing pursuant to La Rev. Stat.

The court noted that the supreme court had previously determined that art. 648A violated the Due Process Clause to the extent that it required a defendant to prove his incompetency by clear and convincing evidence. Although the court presumed that the trial court applied the clear and convincing standard, the court concluded that defendant may not have met the preponderance of the evidence standard.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant went into two banks in which he demanded and took money at gunpoint. On each occasion, a bank employee was able to identify defendant in a photographic lineup. As a result of the witness identifications, the police obtained an arrest warrant for defendant and a search warrant for his residence. They seized clothes similar to those used by defendant in one of the bank robberies. Defendant was eventually arrested. Upon his arrest, he gave a statement inculpating himself and several other individuals. Defendant was found guilty of four counts of armed robbery, one attempt armed robbery, and attempt first-degree robbery. Defendant was then sentenced to 99 years of hard labor. Defendant's major contention on appeal was that the lower court erred when it denied his motion to suppress his confessions. The court affirmed and amended. The court held that defendant's statements should not have been suppressed because there were no allegations by defendant of any force threat, coercion, or promises that caused defendant to give the confessions. Therefore, defendant had failed to rebut that his statements were freely and voluntarily made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs argued that, until they could determine whether the wife's back pain was due to a fall at the supermarket or to the delivery of a baby a few days later, they were unable to file suit, so the suit was within an exception to art. 3492 under which prescription was suspended. On appeal, the court could not conclude that the trial court was clearly wrong in finding that the prescriptive period began to run on the date of her fall. Further, although &sect; 13:850 allowed litigants to transmit a facsimile of a pleading to the court clerk, the statute made the effectiveness of such a filing conditional upon the delivery of the original to a clerk within five days of the transmission. Plaintiffs failed to perform that statutory condition and the court held that the facsimile filing had no force or effect. With respect to plaintiffs' constitutional challenge to &sect; 13:850, the court held that due process did not prohibit the abolition of existing causes of action in order to attain permissible legislative objectives. Because plaintiffs failed to file suit within period required by art. 3492, they did not have a cause of action, and they had no vested property right in bringing suit.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the federal and state constitutions did not empower the court to second-guess legislators who were charged with the heavy responsibility of regulating the social obligations that existed between the employee, the employer, and the public. The formula in &sect; 23:1021(10)(d) provided a reasonable and rational method for meeting the goals of the Louisiana workers' compensation statute. The fact that the classification and the formula applied to the class might result in some inequality to some members of the class did not offend the equal protection provision of the constitution because there was some reasonable basis for the classification. The court held that the trial court's conclusion that the salesman failed to show that the classification and formula provided by &sect; 23:1021(10)(d) did not further any legitimate state interest was not clearly or legally wrong.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Following defendant's conviction for negligent homicide in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:32, the trial court imposed the maximum sentence of five years at hard labor. On appeal of his sentence, defendant argued that the trial court erred by failing to sufficiently set forth its reasons for imposition of sentence and by imposing an unconstitutionally excessive sentence. In affirming, the court ruled that there was an adequate factual basis for the sentence contained in the record and the trial court was not required to articulate every circumstance listed in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. The court held that maximum sentences were reserved for the most egregious and blameworthy of offenders and that, even though defendant was a first-time offender, negligent homicide with a firearm was distinctive because guns were designed to kill. The court also noted that the district attorney did not seek a firearms enhancement under La. Code Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The post office returned the tax collector's notice as undeliverable. After the initial mailing was returned, the sheriff, complying with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2180(B), twice published notice of the impending sale in the local newspaper to apprise the former property owner and the mortgagee of both the tax delinquency and the tax sale. Consequently, in this respect, summary judgment in favor of the tax sale purchaser properly issued. Neither the record nor the posture of the case refuted the applicability of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2180.1, which required that a mortgagee specifically apprise the tax collector of its mortgage in order to be sent notice of the tax delinquency. The former property owner and the mortgagee do not dispute the fact that they did not comply with this provision and, thus, they cannot sustain the burden of proving the invalidity of the tax sale for lack of statutory notice. They also failed to plead the issue of unconstitutionality in a pleading before the trial court, did not particularize the grounds of their claim, and neglected to serve the attorney general. Under these circumstances, the issue was not properly before the court for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The Waiver of Rights form also indicated that the maximum penalty was 50 years.  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:26(B) actually provided for a maximum sentence of 30 years. The record showed that defendant agreed to a sentence of 20 years as part of the plea agreement. Defendant argued that he thought he was receiving a sentence that was less than half of the maximum and that he would not have agreed to the 20 years if he had known it was only ten years less than the maximum penalty. The court held that it appeared that the trial court mistakenly referred to the statute dealing with attempted murder, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:27, in determining defendant's sentence exposure instead of the statute outlining the sentence for criminal conspiracy, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:26.  La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee sought workers' compensation benefits after suffering a stroke while attending a meeting at work. The Office of Workers' Compensation Administration denied benefits and found that it lacked jurisdiction to determine the employee's constitutional challenge to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1021(7)(e), which provided recovery for heart-related or perivascular injuries when caused only by extraordinary physical stress. Subsequently, the court agreed that hearing officers were not vested with authority to rule on the constitutionality of workers' compensation statutes. Accordingly, the court remanded the case to the hearing officer, instructing her to transfer the case to the appropriate trial court for proceedings on the constitutional issue. The employee appealed the trial court's finding that &sect; 23:1021(7)(e) did not violate the Louisiana State Constitution. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court found that the legislature had a legitimate purpose in limiting recovery for heart-related conditions caused by mental stress and that the employee was not foreclosed from bringing a tort action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of possession of 400 grams or more of cocaine as well as possession with intent to distribute cocaine, violations of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(F)(1)(c) and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(A)(1), respectively. He was sentenced to 45 years on the first conviction and 10 years on the second, with sentences to run concurrently. His motion to reconsider the sentences was denied. Defendant appealed. Defendant contended that his convictions and sentences were improper, because of the prohibition against double jeopardy, insufficiency of the evidence, excessiveness of the sentences, and the impropriety of the trial court's action in reconsidering the sentence after an untimely motion to reconsider the sentence and after the motion for appeal had been granted. The State conceded the defendant's double jeopardy claim. Thus, the court vacated the conviction of possession with intent to distribute cocaine, the lesser offense. The court held that the trial court properly amended defendant's sentence. The court upheld defendant's conviction for possession of 400 grams or more of cocaine, but vacated his 45-year sentence as excessive and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also touched the other daughter on her private parts and made her touch his private parts. At trial the mother of the girls testified that defendant admitted the molestation. Also, at the trial the state introduced the deposition of defendant's social worker. The social worker testified that on more than one occasion in the counseling session with defendant, defendant effectively admitted that he had molested his stepdaughters. Defendant was convicted of molesting his stepdaughters. On appeal, defendant alleged that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction and that his statements in counseling should have been suppressed. The court affirmed. The court held that the lower court's decision to credit the victims' videotaped statements of abuse was not irrational and defendant was warned of the non-confidential nature of the communications made to the counselor.</SPAN></P>

The defendant had scratches and bruises on the night of the murder. Defendant's conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal despite the 17 assignments of error raised.

She was sentenced to six years at hard labor and ordered to make restitution. Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to convict and the excessiveness of the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant bought a car from a dealer. She gave the dealer a check for the downpayment. The check was deposited but was returned to the dealer. After she failed to honor verbal demands to make the check good, the dealer sent a registered letter demanding payment, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:71A(2). Defendant did not respond. The dealer's owner then contacted her, demanding that she either pay the check or return the car. She did neither and was arrested. She admitted at trial that she knew she did not have sufficient funds in her account to satisfy the check when she wrote it. Nor had she made restitution in any amount. She urged that the evidence was insufficient to convict. In affirming the judgment of her conviction, the court found that the statutory presumption of intent to defraud under &sect; 14:71A(2) applied where she had refused to timely honor the check after the demand. Also, she knew she had not paid for the car and failed to timely return it to the dealer. Such conduct fell within the accepted meaning of the term &quot;defraud.&quot; However, the court vacated the sentence, as it was the unconstitutionally excessive given her circumstances as a first-felony offender.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1406, in the insurer's concursus proceeding.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employees were injured in an automobile accident, in a vehicle owned by their employer, while in the course and scope of their employment. The accident was in Alabama and the other vehicle was underinsured. The court found that the employer clearly contemplated the addition and deletion of vehicles during the policy term. Thus, the addition or deletion of a vehicle did not constitute a new insurance contract that required the execution of a separate rejection or selection of uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM) coverage. Further, the selection of lower UM limits did not have to be signed at the time of the application or the issuance of the insurance policy, as long as the selection was made prior to the accident. The insurer provided sufficient testimony and documentary evidence that the rejection/selection form signed by the employer complied with statutory requirements, and that the employer understood the coverage options and intentionally and unambiguously selected lower limits of UM coverage. Finally, the trial court did not err in awarding the entire amount of the recovery to the workmen's compensation carrier, whose payments far exceeded the recovery.</SPAN></P>

While police gave chase, he wrecked the car, attempted to shift blame to his passenger, and fled the scene. Defendant was convicted of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. Following defendant's conviction for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, the state filed a habitual offender bill against him. Defendant was found to be a third felony offender with a prior crime of violence under La. Rev. Stat.

On appeal, the court found that the mandatory life sentence stipulated by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 was not cruel, unusual, and excessive. The court further determined that the multiple offender bill applied because defendant did not have 10 felony-free years before committing the present offense.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant school board (board) sought review from the Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Ouachita (Louisiana), where judgment was rendered in favor of plaintiff tenured teacher (teacher) in the form of money damages, plus lost wages, medical specials, and attorney's fees. The case concerned the teacher's alleged demotion and her claims under the Teacher Tenure Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:444, and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The teacher was employed by the board for many years and was in a tenured position. The board assigned the teacher to the position of guidance counselor where she was negatively evaluated. She was thereafter given mundane duties and became depressed. She filed an action against the board and obtained a judgment in the form of money damages, lost wages, medical specials, and attorney's fees. The board sought review. The issues presented concerned the application of the Teacher Tenure Law, the damages awarded, and whether the teacher had a property right entitling her to due process. On review, the court determined that the teacher's statutory rights were violated under the statute. The court determined that the board failed to contract with the teacher and to set forth performance standards as required under the statute. The court observed that the teacher had a protected property right to her position. Further, the actions of the board caused the teacher much distress. The court concluded that the damages awarded were called for due to the teacher's emotional distress, whether intentionally or unintentionally inflicted, and the amount awarded was fair and was not overturned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment in favor of the teacher and against the board concerning the teacher's claims resulting from her alleged demotion was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

He then ripped the phone from the wall and began repeatedly beating her head against a bed headboard while stating he was going to kill her. Defendant was apprehended by police while the beating was in progress. Defendant was charged with attempted second-degree murder and unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling. Defendant entered pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. Defendant waived his right to a jury trial; and, after a bench trial, he was found guilty as charged on both counts and thereafter sought review. On appeal, the court rejected the insufficiency of the evidence argument and found that the state proved the requisite specific intent for the offense. The trial judge was within his discretion when he rejected the contention that defendant was so drugged and/or intoxicated that he could not form the specific intent required for attempted second-degree murder. As to the sentences, the court rejected the argument that the sentences were unconstitutionally excessive. Rather, the court found the sentences were reasonable in light of the offenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The convictions of attempted second-degree murder and unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling, as well as the sentences against defendant, were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation was a concrete business and had taken substantial steps towards the construction of a plant when the city amended its zoning ordinances. This had an adverse affect on the corporation, which filed an action against the city for injunctive relief and damages due to a constitutional taking. The trial court awarded the corporation damages for the city's denial of the corporation's substantive due process rights via a deprivation of its property. The city sought review asserting an error in this determination, and the corporation answered the appeal and sought additional relief. On appeal, the court observed that there was no evidence that the city's zoning board ever denied a request for the plant. The court concluded that the corporation's claim was not ripe because the final decision of the zoning board was not adverse to the corporation which was the complaining party. The court, in addressing the merits of the action, found that the inability to operate the plant did not destroy a major portion of the property's value and therefore, there was no taking. Also, the trial court committed legal error in finding that the city acted arbitrarily and capriciously.</SPAN></P>

He then sought a petition for a writ of habeas corpus stating that, although his original conviction and sentence were lawful, his continuation in custody was unlawful because the parole board violated his constitutional rights to due process. He further claimed due process protection because he had a liberty interest in parole created by and inherent in La. Rev. Stat.

The court held that the state was required to produce to defendant the report of its expert, which it did, but not the sources relied upon by the expert in forming the report. The court held that the trial court should have used the preponderance of the evidence standard regarding defendant's capacity, but that even under that standard defendant failed to demonstrate his incapacity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Property owners failed to renovate their house and the city sued them for creating a nuisance. Eventually the owners and the city entered into a consent agreement, whereby the owners would complete the repairs on the house. After the owners failed to renovate, the city brought suit, seeking a finding of contempt. The trial court found the owners in contempt and ordered them to pay damages to the city. The owners appealed the ruling, claiming that it was erroneous. The court held that the consent agreement was a bilateral contract which was binding, and could not be directly appealed to the court. The court stated that it could not invalidate the agreement on the grounds that it was a bad deal or more expensive than anticipated. The court determined that the consent agreement was valid and enforceable, and therefore the trial court correctly found the owners in contempt for failing to live up to their agreement. However, the court concluded that the amount of the fine was excessive, and should be reduced. Finally, the court ordered that the fine was payable to the court and not to the city, because it was remedial in nature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal of the mortgagee's action to quiet title the mortgagee argued that as mortgagee of the property, he did not get notice of the impending city tax sale, rendering that sale a nullity; and that La. Rev. Stat. Ann &sect; 47:2180.1, which required the mortgagee to notify the tax collector of any recorded mortgage, was unconstitutional because it shifted the burden from the tax collector to the mortgagee of ensuring adequate notice. The tax sale purchaser of the property argued that the mortgagee had failed to establish that he was entitled to notice under La. Rev. Stat. Ann &sect; 47:2180.1. The court held that that the mortgagee was not reasonably identifiable and therefore constructive notice of the tax sale satisfied due process requirements as to him. Further, under the facts presented in this case, the mortgagee's Fourteenth Amendment Due Process rights were not violated, and &sect; 47:2180.1 had no bearing on the court's decision; thus the constitutionality of the statute was not addressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Th court affirmed the judgment of the trial court quieting and confirming title and ownership of the disputed property in the tax sale purchaser.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, a radiologist and the state patient's compensation fund, sought review of an order of the Civil District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), which awarded damages to plaintiffs, a widow and the adult children of the deceased, based upon a finding that the radiologist had breached the applicable standard of care.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that the radiologist's improper reading of deceased's x-ray resulted in a loss of chance to survive a chest wall cancer. The radiologist argued peremption and that the jury was manifestly erroneous in finding that the deceased might have survived if his cancer had been diagnosed eleven months earlier because the testimony did not reasonably support that conclusion. The family contended that the facts and circumstances were insufficient to infer that the widow's discussion with the pulmonologist put them on notice that malpractice had occurred or that any harm had thereby resulted, and that their claims were timely filed within one year of deceased's death. The court held that the family's claims to recover for injuries suffered by the deceased were perempted by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628; only compensation for their own losses arising from his death may be recovered. The court held that in view of the diagnosis and the general agreement on the favorable outlook if a sarcoma were promptly detected and treated while small, the jury could reasonably conclude that the eleven month delay contributed to the deceased's failure to survive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the district court as to liability but amended the damages awarded in the family's claim for the deceased's lost chance to survive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff insurance company and defendants, the Louisiana Insurance Rating Commission, its chairman, and its members, filed applications for rehearing of the court's decision to reverse a trial court judgment that declared a commission bulletin to be a rule and that declared the rule null and void. The court reversed the judgment because it was not rendered in conformity with the procedural requirements of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:963.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commission asserted that the court's decision went too far in finding its rule invalid. The court, however, noted that its decision made no substantive finding that the rule was invalid. Therefore, the court found the commission's complaint on rehearing to be without merit. The company's basic complaint on rehearing was that it did not like the stringent requirements of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:963(D), which was part of the Louisiana Administrative Procedures Act. Although the court agreed with the company that there were some serious problems with &sect; 49:963(D), the court concluded that if any reform or modification to &sect; 49:963(D) was to be made, it would have to be done by the legislature or by the Louisiana Supreme Court when faced with a constitutional issue. The court rejected the company's assertion that the court's opinion was in conflict with an earlier decision. The court also rejected the company's argument that the trial court was the proper forum to address the alleged unconstitutionality of the commission's bulletin, finding that the case could be disposed of on the basis of nonconstitutional issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the applications for rehearing that were filed by the company and by the commission.</SPAN></P>

The sports director testified about her conversation with the teenager. A jury convicted defendant as charged. The trial court sentenced defendant to 12 years in prison at hard labor without benefit of parole or suspension of sentence. Defendant sought review, contending that his sentence was excessive. On appeal the court held that an excessive sentence was nothing more than the needless imposition of pain and suffering, however, the legislature was authorized to punish a more offensive type of conduct more severely.</SPAN></P>

The parents filed a tort suit alleging wrongful removal of their son. The trial court granted the parents and their daughter substantial damages. On appeal the court held that the State's involvement with the son ceased after the six months and a one-year liberative prescription period began to run after that point.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of first degree robbery and simple escape. He was subsequently billed a habitual offender on the robbery conviction in the 16th Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of St. Mary (Louisiana). The district court sentenced him on the conviction as a third felony offender to life imprisonment without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was billed as a habitual offender after his conviction for first degree robbery and escape. Thereafter, the district court sentenced him on the robbery conviction as a third felony offender to life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. Defendant appealed. He urged that the life sentence imposed by the district court was excessive. The court found that the life sentence imposed was not grossly disproportionate to defendant's crimes. First degree robbery was a serious offense that involved force or intimidation, when the offender lead the victim to reasonably believe he was armed with a dangerous weapon, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64.1. The robbery and use of force or intimidation by defendant was not an isolated incident. Defendant was a third felony offender. Thus, no proportionality review was necessary. However, if the court conducted such a review, based upon the facts in the record, the court would have found that the sentence imposed by the district court was tailored to both the offender and the offense, and was not excessive. Accordingly, the court found no merit in defendant's assignment of error.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 13:4712 for the abatement of a public nuisance complained of an adverse judgment of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, contending that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and, alternatively, that plaintiff city failed to adequately comply with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4713.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city asserted that the property owner's residences supported the maintenance of a nuisance as defined in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4711 et seq. The property owner contended that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4711(A)(2) failed to explain what was required of a person to avoid an injunction or contempt citation, or how an owner can avoid &quot;permitting&quot; the nuisance to exist. The court held that, to avoid the issuance of a permanent injunction, the property owner must maintain nuisance-free premises. The statute simply forbade the act of maintaining a nuisance; it did not place any affirmative duty on the property owner. The language was sufficient to give persons of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what conduct is prohibited. Therefore, that language did not render the statute void for vagueness. The court held, however, that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4713B set forth the procedure to be followed by the city in obtaining an injunction or order of abatement, and that the trial court erred in granting a permanent injunction without first conducting a preliminary hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the denial of the property owner's exception of no cause of action. The court vacated the judgment issuing the injunction, and remanded this case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers sought to recover severance taxes paid under protest. On a prior remand, the court had determined that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:1, prior to its amendment, exempted land acquired by the United States from all taxation, including severance taxes, and that the 1982 amendment to &sect; 52:1 was intended to specifically authorize the imposition of severance taxes upon natural resources severed from within the confines of land acquired by the United States. The secretary appealed and the Louisiana Supreme Court remanded the case for reconsideration, that court having held that the state could lawfully impose severance taxes on fugitive oil and gas captured from beneath a portion of the lands within the confines of a federal enclave for the taxable period of January 1, 1980 through September 10, 1982. The court noted that the legislature, in amending &sect; 52:1, intended to make clear its authorization for the imposition of severance taxes on mineral lessees of federal lands, and also noted that this authorization had always existed under state law. The court held, therefore, that the taxpayers owed severance taxes for the period of December, 1979, through September, 1982.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in favor of the State of Louisiana, plaintiff in reconvention, awarding taxes, together with interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was accused of raping a woman at gunpoint at his own home. Police arrived and discovered evidence used at trial. Defendant was convicted and thereafter sought review and asserted issues concerning jury impaneling, right to confrontation, evidence and suppression matters, insufficient evidence, and the sentence imposed. On review, the court found that the State sustained its burden of articulating &quot;race-neutral&quot; reasons for the exercise of a peremptory strike and found no abuse of discretion or error by the trial court in its determination that there was no purposeful discrimination based on race by the State against African-American individuals. The court found that defendant was able to properly cross-examine the victim concerning her credibility and that the trial court acted in a manner which protected this right. The court found no error in the trial court's ruling that defendant's arrest was lawfully made with probable cause, and that defendant validly consented to the search of his home. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to prove defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, the court affirmed the sentence given by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police received information that a grocery store would be robbed. Defendant was arrested along with two others before the crime could be committed. Defendant admitted that she participated in planning the robbery and was to share in its proceeds. Defendant was charged with conspiracy to commit first degree robbery. After defendant withdrew her initial plea of not guilty and pled guilty, the trial court sentenced her to imprisonment at hard labor for five years without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. Her motion to reconsider sentence was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:26(C), defendant was to be sentenced in the same manner as the offense contemplated by the conspirators. First degree robbery required that the entire sentence be served without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. The trial court did not misunderstand the applicable penalty and did not apply the incorrect law in sentencing defendant. The trial court considered the mitigating factors urged by defendant, but noted the seriousness of the crime and defendant's &quot;blase&quot; attitude toward it. Defendant's sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

Defendant, who had a prior felony drug conviction, admitted that he was at the scene of the crime and struggled with the victim, but said that the gun went off during a struggle. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced. He sought review arguing that the trial court erred in failing to grant a mistrial under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 770(2) due to a police witness' reference to a &quot;mug shot&quot; of defendant in the police files. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment on the grounds that defendant erroneously relied upon art. 770 (2) in support of his argument that a mistrial was mandatory in his case. The court found that the comment was made by a police officer, not the judge, district attorney or other court official, and that a police officer was not a court official under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 770. The court held that defendant was not erroneously prohibited from presenting evidence about his criminal intent because although relevant, the evidence's probative value was substantially outweighed by other factors.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the judgment, the court held that this was the correct interpretation of the effect of the amendment to &sect; 26:281(I). The court held that by failing to ban three and two-tenths beer, the parish residents had in fact approved its sale. Three and two-tenths beer having been approved, albeit tacitly, by the parish residents, the Police Jury was within its lawful authority in enacting an ordinance that permitted the sale of six percent beer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Twenty-Eighth Judicial District Court, Parish of LaSalle, State of Louisiana, which adjudicated defendant a third felony offender under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, which vacated his prior, plea bargained sentence upon his plea of guilty to attempted possession of cocaine, and which imposed a habitual offender sentence on him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to attempted possession of cocaine and the trial court sentenced defendant pursuant to the terms of his plea bargain. The State subsequently filed a habitual offender bill against defendant. The trial court adjudicated defendant a third felony offender under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15: 529.1, vacated the plea bargain sentence, and imposed a habitual offender sentence on defendant. On appeal, the court reviewed the case for errors patent on the face of the record pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 920, and remanded the case for further consideration. The trial court committed plain error by not giving defendant credit for time served as required by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 880. If the State agreed not to enhance defendant's sentence as a habitual offender, the plea bargain had to be upheld. If defendant reasonably believed that the State would not seek to enhance his sentence, his guilty plea had to be set aside as being involuntary. If the State promised not to use the current conviction as an enhancement for any future convictions, the plea bargain was void as against public policy, and defendant was entitled to withdraw his plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded the case to determine the State's agreement for defendant's plea of guilty to attempted cocaine possession. Defendant could not be sentenced as a third felony offender if the State agreed not to enhance his sentence. Defendant's plea had to be set aside if he reasonably but inaccurately believed the State made that promise, or if the State improperly agreed not to use the current conviction to enhance any future convictions.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 3 (1974), and which entered judgment for defendant parish school board on the employees' suit for wrongful termination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:524 as amended by 1988 La. Acts 79, a parish school board eliminated the positions of two nonteaching employees due to lack of funds. The employees sued the board for wrongful termination, and alleged that the amendment violated their equal protection rights under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 (1974) because teachers were not subject to the amendment. The trial court found that the amendment was constitutional and entered judgment for the board. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that because the classifications in the amendment were not specifically enumerated in La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 (1974), the employees had the burden of proving that the classification were not rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. Because the paramount purpose of the school board was to educate children, and because teachers were essential to that purpose, the employees did not meet their burden. The board properly eliminated the positions by the adoption of a budget, and the evidence showed that the board had limited funds. Therefore, the judgment was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment which found that a law that allowed a school board to reduce the number of its nonteaching employees, but not its teachers, for budgetary reasons did not violate the nonteaching employees' equal protection rights under the Louisiana Constitution, and which entered judgment for a parish school board on the employees' suit for wrongful discharge.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 26:801-812 by terminating a contract entered into with the beer wholesaler.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A beer supplier and a beer wholesaler had a wholesale sales agreement obligating the wholesaler to maximize the sales of the supplier's beer in a geographical area. Concerned about dropping beer sales, the supplier gave notice of its intent to terminate pursuant to a contractual provision entitling it to terminate the agreement according to its sole discretion. The wholesaler filed suit against the supplier, contending that the termination would violate La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 26:901-812, a statute enacted in 1993 that regulated contracts between beer suppliers and wholesalers, and that prevented suppliers from terminating such agreements with wholesalers without complying with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:805. The trial court granted the wholesaler's request for a preliminary injunction, and the supplier appealed. The court reversed the judgment and vacated the injunction. It held that the statute expressed a legislative intent that the 1993 statute not be retroactive, and thus that the statute did not regulate the 1990 contract between the parties. The court specifically held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:803 did not apply to the termination provision in the parties' contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State applied for a writ of certiorari and prohibition from the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), which, under a plea bargain, sentenced defendant to 10 years imprisonment upon his plea of guilty to possession of cocaine and battery of a police officer under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40:967(C) and 14:34.2, rather than to life imprisonment as mandated by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1)(b)(ii) for a third felony offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to a plea bargain, defendant pled guilty to possession of cocaine and battery of a police officer under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40:967(C) and 14:34.2, and the trial court sentenced defendant to 10 years imprisonment. The State applied for a writ of certiorari and prohibition challenging the sentence, and the court granted the writ, vacated the sentence and remanded the case for reconsideration. Because defendant was a third felony offender, his minimum mandatory sentence under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1)(b)(ii) was life imprisonment. The trial court failed to justify its deviation from the mandatory minimum sentence by stating the facts that made the minimum sentence so grossly disproportionate to the severity of the offense so as to shock the sense of justice. Therefore, the sentence was improper and the trial court had to resentence defendant to the maximum sentence that was not constitutionally excessive, and to justify any deviation from the mandated minimum. If the new sentence was greater than 10 years, defendant was entitled to an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the State's application for a writ of certiorari and prohibition, vacated defendant's sentence, and remanded the case for the trial court to impose the maximum constitutional sentence, to justify any change from the statutory minimum for a third felony offender, and to allow defendant to withdraw his pleas of guilty to cocaine possession and battery of a police officer if the new sentence was more than the plea bargain sentence.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's pro se request to change his appointed counsel. The bystanders' cries were admissible under La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 801D(4) to show why the victim chased defendant rather than hearsay under La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 801C, and were also admissible excited utterances under La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 803(1)(2). The conviction was proper even if defendant only picked up the wallet if the victim dropped it. Because all of defendant's convictions were for nonviolent felonies, the sentence was excessive and violated La. Const. art.

His request was denied and he filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus and mandamus. In his pleadings, he requested the issuance of an order stating that he was to be considered immediately eligible for parole consideration. The commissioner found petitioner had failed to prove that the law in effect on the date of his offense allowed for parole eligibility on his life sentence. Based on that finding and the commissioner's adjudication, the district court's judgment dismissed his claim, with prejudice. From that judgment, he sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment on the grounds that due to the requirements of the current and former La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer contended that claimant's medical benefits were timely paid, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1201(F), because a statute extended the payment period from 14 to 60 days. On appeal, the court found that the statute was procedural, but concluded that it did not apply retroactively because retroactive application would have operated to unconstitutionally disturb the employee's vested rights to compensation of her medical bills within 14 days. The court found no merit to the employer's alternate theory that penalties could not be awarded for its failure to provide medical benefits, but only for its failure to pay wage benefits because La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1201 was amended to provide for a penalty on any unpaid medical benefits. The court further held that the employer waived its opportunity to protest its financial responsibility for the employee's rehabilitation efforts because the employer failed to comply with rehabilitation efforts set forth in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1226. The court also concluded that the employee was allowed to have her fringe benefits included in her wage calculation.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions, vacated the sentences, and remanded for resentencing on the grounds that the trial court did not give defendant credit toward service of his sentence for time spent in actual custody before the imposition of sentence. The court rejected defendant's argument that his convictions were invalid because there was no physical evidence proving that he was present at the crime scenes due to there being no legal requirement that physical evidence had to be produced to support a conviction. The court held that even thought the State failed to properly produce and authentic, admissible documents in order to meet its burden to prove defendant a habitual offender the errors were harmless.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The police discovered defendant sitting in a car with a loaded rifle. After he stepped out of the car and was given Miranda rights, the police noted a syringe on the car floor and found methamphetamine in his pocket. In exchange for pleading guilty to possession, a firearm charge was dropped and the state agreed not to prosecute him as a habitual offender, as he had a previous conviction. Upon being sentenced to five years at hard labor, defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court failed to adequately articulate reasons for the sentence, as required by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1, and that it was excessive. The court disagreed, explaining that it would not set aside a sentence in the absence of an abuse of discretion. Applying a two-step analysis, the court ruled that the trial court considered the factors listed in the statute, namely, personal history, prior record, seriousness of the offense, and likelihood of rehabilitation, reviewed a presentence investigation report, found no mitigating factors, and considered as an aggravating factor defendant's serious drug problem. As there was an undue risk he would commit another offense, the sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. It held that sufficient evidence supported the conviction and that the trial court did not err in failing to grant a mistrial based on a testifying police officer's vague reference to defendant's prior bad acts. It further held that the application of the life imprisonment provision of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 A(1)(c)(ii) did not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws, and that because the offense with which defendant was initially charged was not punishable by life imprisonment, he need not have been indicted by a grand jury. The court also held that the fact that defendant's sentence for possession of cocaine apparently reflected his prior felony history did not exempt him from sentence as a multiple offender; that there was no error in regarding his guilty pleas to aggregate worthless check offenses as predicate offenses for the adjudication; that he was adequately identified as the person convicted of the prior felonies; and that the life sentence was not constitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

On appeal defendant alleged that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that her blood-alcohol concentration, combined with her operation of the vehicle, caused the death of the nursing student.

The trial court dismissed the pedestrian's action. The court held that the pedestrian failed to demonstrate that the city had constructive notice of the post, because the posts were placed not more than several hours prior to the accident, and were removed each day.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs filed an action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and stay to prevent irreparable injury from defendants' intended violation of public notice requirements. Specifically, it was a petition for injunctive relief to prevent defendants from causing irreparable injury by carrying out their stated intention to take certain voluntary actions which would have effectuated their own voluntary policy choices as to how and when to implement the new federal welfare reform law, without giving the public prior notice of their policy choices or an opportunity to comment. The lower court denied preliminary injunctive relief and later ruled against plaintiffs who sought review arguing that the lower court erred in finding that the challenged policies adopted by emergency rule were temporarily justified. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment on the grounds that the trial court was correct in finding that the emergency rulemaking undertaken by the department was authorized by La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and a co-defendant robbed restaurant employees of money and a police officer of his weapon at gunpoint, ran to a residence to hide, and locked the elderly residents in the bathroom. Defendant appealed his armed robbery and aggravated kidnapping convictions. The court affirmed because defendant failed to make a contemporaneous objections to a reasonable doubt instruction, the questioning of the co-defendant, and the trial court's failure to question jurors about a newspaper article and was not entitled to raise those issues on appeal. The employees' face-to-face identifications of defendant, which were made shortly after the crime and without police prompting, did not give rise to a substantial likelihood of misidentification. The court held that the kidnapping conviction was not double jeopardy because defendant used the residents as a shield to avoid capture, not to facilitate the armed robbery. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling the Batson challenge and imposing the maximum and consecutive sentences because defendant placed the victims in fear of their lives, had prior felony convictions, and was a public risk.</SPAN></P>

The court held that an election contest was an election contest, whether the contestant decried the conduct of the election or claimed, as plaintiff did, that the election was a nullity. The court held that the short delay for filing an election contest, aside from being a prerogative of the legislature, was prudent given the importance of governance and the importance of certainty and stability of governments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim was placing groceries in her car when defendant and another woman approached her from behind. The victim knew defendant because they were both in a relationship with the same man. Words were exchanged and the three women began fighting. During the melee, defendant took the victim's purse. Defendant was subsequently charged with purse snatching. A jury found defendant guilty and the trial court sentenced her to serve three years imprisonment at hard labor. Her timely motion for reconsideration of sentence was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed. The record supported defendant's conviction. Defendant denied taking the victim's purse, but eyewitnesses substantially corroborated the victim's testimony concerning the physical attack and theft. The jury heard conflicting testimony and chose to accept the version of events described by the State's witnesses. The jury's credibility determination was rational. The jury could reasonably conclude that defendant committed the offense charged. The sentence imposed was not constitutionally excessive. The sentence was neither grossly out of proportion to the seriousness of the offense nor did it shock the sense of justice.</SPAN></P>

He appealed his conviction, arguing that his trial was invalid and the sentence was illegal. The court held that the evidence was legally sufficient for a jury to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also stated that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting defendant's voir dire, and that defendant's challenge for cause as to jury members was correctly denied, as there was no evidence of bias. The court also determined that the prosecutor's failure to present a probable cause sheet in a timely manner did not cause undue prejudice and thus was not a reversible error. Finally, the court concluded that the trial court did not commit reversible error in admitting the victim's hearsay evidence, because the jury had an independent basis for finding that the rape occurred, and therefore the hearsay evidence was merely repetitive in nature. The court upheld defendant's conviction and dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court held that an ordinary person of reasonable intelligence was capable of discerning its meaning and conforming his conduct to it. The court held that the trial court should have suppressed the pretrial statement of defendant because he was not advised as required by Miranda v. Arizona. At the time that defendant made the second statement he had been picked up an officer and driven to the detective bureau. He was placed in an office and later interviewed by an officer.

The trial court's judgment was affirmed on appeal despite numerous assignments of error raised by defendant. Among the court's findings, the court found that defendant had waived his right to assert error in the admission of testimony by a witness, where the witness allegedly testified that defendant had robbed him in the past, because defendant failed to object to the witness's testimony at trial. The court found defendant's contention that the trial court improperly admitted hearsay testimony during the state's case to be without merit. In response to defendant's contention that the trial court erred in failing to charge the law applicable to the case, the court found that, based on the charges as a whole, that the jury was well aware that it should view the accomplice's testimony with great caution. Moreover, defendant's failure to object to a remark made by the trial judge to the jury waived defendant's right to argue that the trial court erred in commenting on the facts of the case.

Following a weeklong jury trial, the jury found that the landowner was totally at fault and that the plaintiffs were fishing for recreational purposes at the time of the accident. The trial court entered judgment for the landowner. On review, plaintiffs contended that the trial court erred in granting immunity to the landowner because (1) there was no evidence that the landowner had dedicated the bay for recreational purposes, (2) plaintiffs were not given permission to use the bay, and (3) the instrument was a man-made concrete post. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that it was not necessary for the landowner to have given permission to the plaintiffs for the immunity under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2791. The court also held that the fact that the instrument that caused the accident was man-made did not of itself defeat the immunity. Because the record indicated that the bay was not used primarily for commercial recreational purposes, the court noted that &sect; 9:2791 applied, not La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2795.</SPAN></P>

She claimed that the decedent was her biological father as the result of an adulterous affair with her mother. The decedent was survived by his wife. He was also survived by his two legitimate children that resulted from the marriage. To aid in proving the relationship between herself and the decedent, the alleged daughter compelled the decedent's legitimate daughter to submit blood for DNA comparison. The lower court characterized the evidence as ambiguous at best. The lower court ruled that the alleged daughter was not the biological child of the decedent. On appeal the alleged daughter asserted that the lower court erred when it applied the clear and convincing standard of proof to her action. The court affirmed. The court held that La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 209(C), which was an amendment to the statute in which the alleged daughter filed her action, applied retroactively and hence the alleged daughter's burden was clear and convincing evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, a state government, a hospital, and two physicians, appealed the judgment of the Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Ouachita (Louisiana), which held that they were liable in malpractice to plaintiffs, parents of a newborn who died of asphyxia.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An infant died of asphyxia, after being delivered by two physicians. The parents of the infant sued the physicians, and brought a wrongful death lawsuit and a newborn's survival claim against the physicians, the hospital, and the state government. The trial court awarded the parents damages up to the amount of the statutory cap set by law, and both parties appealed the ruling. The court held that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to reasonably believe that the physicians committed malpractice by failing to diagnose the infant's distress during childbirth. The court also determined that the jury's findings that mother did not contribute to her child's death was not manifestly erroneous. In addition, the court stated that the hospital was correctly found liable under the doctrine of vicarious liability for the actions of its physicians. Finally, the court concluded that state law, which limited the amount of recovery, was constitutional, and the parents' wrongful death claim was separate and distinct from their newborn's survival claim. The court upheld the trial court's ruling and dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was employed on a unit basis as a pulpwood cutter and he was injured on the job.

The employee alleged that under the formula of &sect; 23:1021(10)(d) he was credited with only four days per week of earnings in the calculation of the average weekly wage, which he claimed reduced the wages of a unit worker who worked five days per week by 20 percent and the wages of a unit worker who worked six day per week by 33 and 1/3 percent. The employee brought an action for a declaratory judgment in the district court which sought to have &sect; 23:1021 (10)(d) declared unconstitutional. The state brought a declinatory exception of lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that the Office of Worker's Compensation (OWC), was vested with exclusive jurisdiction to here the employee's action. The lower court sustained the declinatory exception. On appeal the court reversed. The court held that because the employee's action was not a claim or dispute for application of the worker's compensation act that it was outside the jurisdiction of the OWC.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was pulled over while driving for following another vehicle too closely in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:81(A). He was then arrested for possession of marijuana. Defendant pled guilty to possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and received a six-year sentence. Defendant then filed a motion to quash the bill of information because of the unconstitutionally vague language of the statute. The trial court denied that motion, and defendant appealed. The court held that words used in statutes did not have to have the same mathematical symbols. Due process required only that the language of the statute have generally accepted meaning so that a person of ordinary and reasonable intelligence was capable of discerning it proscriptions and was given fair notice of the conduct which was forbidden by its terms. Here, the statute at issue, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:81(A), provided that the driver of a motor vehicle could not follow another vehicle more closely than was reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of such vehicle and the traffic upon the condition of the highway.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant city appealed a judgment from the Office of Workers' Compensation, District 8 (Louisiana), that found that appellee worker at that time had a temporary total disability (TTD) because of a work-related accident and that awarded him attorney fees after finding that the city had arbitrarily and capriciously failed to promptly notify the office that it modified the worker's benefits from TTD benefits to supplemental-earnings benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A hearing officer determined that the worker was entitled to temporary-total-disability (TTD) benefits, and the city appealed. On appeal, the court determined that the worker had not met the threshold burden of proving an entitlement to TTD benefits. According to the court, the only basis for finding that the worker continued to be temporarily and totally disabled was the worker's own testimony, and this testimony did not establish by clear and convincing evidence that the worker remained temporarily and totally disabled four years after the accident. The court accepted the city's argument that the hearing officer erred in awarding attorney fees to the worker for failure of the city to promptly notify the worker and the office of the change in the status of benefits per La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1201(G) [changed to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1201(H)]. Among the reasons the court gave were that &sect; 23:1201(H) contained no penalty provision, and it did not pertain to a situation in which the amount of the worker's payments had not been altered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Ruling in favor of the city and against the worker, the court reversed the office's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. Costs of the appeal were assigned to the worker.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board found violations of La. Rev. Stat.

The board imposed a fine, suspended the doctor for three months, and ordered attendance at a pain management course. The trial court affirmed as to the first violation, reversed as to the second two, and modified the sanction to eliminate the suspension and the course. On appeal, the court reinstated the board's decision. The court noted the investigation and the lack of notice were undisputed, and supported affirmance as to the first violation, but that the trial court's reversals were manifestly erroneous. The court noted evidence that the doctor had prescribed controlled substances to patients without a treatment plan, and in some cases, for up to eight months with a medical exam.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate filed his tort suit after he was injured while operating an incinerator at the prison. Specifically, he averred that while he was raking ash inside the incinerator, an explosion occurred, causing a burning object to propel through the door. The burning object struck him resulting in burns. Even though he chose to invoke the administrative remedies available to him, he urged that the Corrections Administrative Remedy Procedure Act as it applied to inmate tort claims was unconstitutional, and therefore, he was entitled to bring his tort action directly in state court. He contended that because the Act was not constitutionally applied to his tort claim, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1177's 30 day time limitation had not applied to his action. The trial court dismissed his action and he sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment on the grounds that the Act was constitutional. The court held that the Act's peremptive time period for seeking judicial review of an adverse administrative decision could have been applied to an inmate's tort claim filed in state district court. The court found that all statutory enactments were presumed to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the Louisiana Insurance Rating Commission, Louisiana Commissioner of Insurance, and rating commissioners (LIRC), sought review of a judgment of the 19th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), in favor of appellee insurer, which declared invalid an LIRC rule prohibiting the issuance of &quot;wrap-up insurance, &quot; and enjoined enforcement against the insurer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">LIRC issued a bulletin to insurers requiring submission of any &quot;wrap-up&quot; insurance rules and rates to the LIRC for approval and commenced administrative proceedings against the insurer for failure to comply. The insurer commenced an action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1871 et seq. The trial court declared the bulletin to be a &quot;rule&quot; subject to the Louisiana Administrative Procedure Act (LAPA), declared it invalid for noncompliance with LAPA rule-making requirements, and enjoined enforcement. On appeal, the court reversed. The court upheld the trial court's finding that the bulletin was a &quot;rule,&quot; subject to LAPA. However, the court held that absent specific statutory provisions for review of LIRC rules, the requirements of the LAPA set forth in La. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:963(D), not the general Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure, applied to applications for declaratory relief. The court found that the insurer had not met the prerequisites under &sect; 49:963(D), thus the trial court lacked authority to render declaratory, and in turn, injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court judgment in favor of the insurer, which declared invalid an LIRC rule, and enjoined enforcement against the insurer. The court remanded to the trial court with the order to direct the insurer to apply to LIRC for reconsideration of validity of the rule in light of the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, city and state officials, appealed a judgment from the 23rd Judicial District Court, Parish of Ascension, Louisiana, which declared that certain industrial areas in which plaintiffs, property owners, owned property could not be included in a proposed municipality, which defendants were attempting to have incorporated. The judgment also granted a permanent injunction of any further action to incorporate the proposed areas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants contended that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 51:1202 and 1203 were in abrogation of a municipality's power to levy an ad valorem tax. Recognizing that tax revenues enabled municipalities to provide services such as clean water and sewerage disposal, defendants contended that the proposed municipality could not exist without a sufficient tax base. In other words, it would be unable to provide such services to the people who lived within the municipality if the industrial areas were not included in its tax base. By not including these industrial areas in the proposed municipality, &sect;&sect; 51:1202 and 1203 removed them from the proposed municipality's tax base. Therefore, defendants contended the legislature created an exemption from ad valorem taxation in derogation of La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 27. Because they did not prove either that the legislature's enactment of &sect;&sect; 51:1202 and 1203 was in contravention of a specific constitutional provision, or that there was a constitutional intention to limit the power of the legislature in the manner claimed, the court concluded that the trial court did not err in granting the injunction and denying the defendants' exception of no cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgments of the trial court denying defendants' exceptions raising the objections of prematurity, jurisdiction and no cause/no right of action, and affirmed the judgment granting declaratory and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a personal injury action against the state arising from a diving accident at a public lake, the Louisiana Supreme Court vacated the trial court's judgment for plaintiffs, an injured boy and his parents, and remanded to the court because the trial court erred in rejecting the state's immunity argument by declaring the Recreational Use Statute (RUS), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2795, unconstitutional, as that was unnecessary to decide the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The boy broke his neck when he dove into a shallow part of a recreational lake. The state admitted that it had knowledge of the depth at the site for years. The court reviewed the evidence de novo to determine whether the state was immune from liability under &sect; 9:2795 and reversed the trial court, finding that it had made an error of law in its interpretation of the statute. Using a three-prong test, the court determined that the statutory immunity in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2795(E) applied in the instant case. Addressing the second prong first, the court found &sect; 9:2795(E) relieved the state of proving the injury was the result of recreation that could be pursued in the true outdoors. Besides, there was no serious dispute about the issue of recreational use. The third prong was satisfied because the bottom of the lake was an instrumentality normally found in the &quot;true outdoors.&quot; The first prong was satisfied because the development of the lake for recreation did not change the character of the area from semi-rural. Accordingly, the state and its agencies were entitled to the immunity granted in &sect; 9:2795 and owed no duty to the boy to warn him of the shallow bottom.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Having concluded that the state was not responsible for the boy's injuries, the court reversed the trial court judgment in his favor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of Rapides, Louisiana, which convicted him of two counts of distribution of cocaine. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in refusing to allow him to question a state witness regarding her prior arrests and any influence which her pending charges might have had on her testimony; as well as any arrangements she had with law enforcement officials.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The witness was a confidential informant who identified defendant as the individual who had distributed cocaine to her. She had entered into an agreement with the State wherein the charges pending against her would be dropped in exchange for providing information and working narcotics cases. Under cross-examination, when defendant attempted to impeach the informant with questions as to whether she had recently been arrested on drug charges, the State objected. The court found that the trial court erred in refusing to allow defendant to question the informant about her pending charge, but that such error was harmless. The court concluded that, although the informant's testimony was important to the State's case, it was cumulative and was corroborated on many material points by the testimony of the arresting officer. The informant was cross-examined extensively regarding her incentive for entering into an agreement with the police and about her prior conviction for distribution of cocaine. Finally, even without the informant's testimony, the arresting officer's testimony was sufficient to convict defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for distribution of cocaine. However, the court remanded the case to the trial court to amend the commitment and minute entry of defendant's sentence to reflect that he was given credit for time served.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the mortgagees' motion for summary judgment, and then entered judgment dismissing their action. On appeal, the mortgagees specified that the trial court erred in rendering a judgment against them and in favor of a nonmoving party prior to a trial on the merits and in failing to find that the tax sales were unconstitutional deprivations of property without due process, and further asserting that the record was complete enough to allow the court to decide the merits of their claim without first remanding the case to the trial court. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for a trial on the merits, holding that the trial court was not authorized to render a judgment on the merits in favor of the purchasers upon denial of the mortgagees' motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After taking disability retirement, a certified teacher's application for rehire was rejected by the parish school board.

He appealed, and the court reversed the judgment. It held that because the parish school board retained, under La. Rev. Stat.

The court did not award damages. It reasoned that the teacher sustained no economic loss because he was making more money in his current position than he would have had he been re-hired; that he failed to claim punitive damages or to prove psychological pain; and that he was not entitled to attorney's fees, where he had failed to recover any other damages and where he had refused the remedy of reinstatement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, the driver of a tractor-trailer, his employer, and their insurer, appealed from a judgment of the Twenty-Seventh Judicial District Court for the Parish of St. Landry (Louisiana), which overturned a jury verdict and found the driver was 100 percent at fault in an accident that injured plaintiffs, the driver of a pickup truck and her passengers. The trial court also increased the amount of damages that the jury awarded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The jury found that the driver of the pickup truck was 20 percent at fault in an accident and awarded damages to her and her passengers. Following the jury verdict, the injured persons filed a successful motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict to increase the amount of damages and to find that the driver of the tractor-trailer was 100 percent at fault. The trial court sustained the motion. On review, the court determined that the facts and inferences pointed so strongly in favor of the trial court removing fault from the driver of the pickup truck, that reasonable men could not arrive at a contrary verdict. No evidence was presented to indicate that the driver of the pickup truck could have maneuvered her vehicle to avoid the accident, nor was there evidence indicating that she was traveling in excess of the posted speed limit. As for the judge's decision to increase the amount of the jury awards, the court held that the jury's verdicts were clearly wrong and contrary to the evidence. The jury failed to award damages for proven injuries. The amounts determined by the trial court were justifiable and within the range established by trial evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court which granted the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict that the driver of the pickup truck and her passengers filed to change the jury's finding of fault and award of damages in the action they brought following an accident against the driver of a tractor-trailer, his employer, and their insurer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of his conviction, by the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo, Louisiana, for distribution of cocaine in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of cocaine distribution and was adjudicated a habitual offender. On appeal, the court affirmed his conviction, holding that the uncontradicted testimony of a police officer who purchased drugs from defendant was sufficient to support the conviction, and that the testimony of police officers and crime lab technicians established a chain of custody by a preponderance of the evidence. The court further held that there was neither error nor prejudice in the trial court's sustaining of the prosecutor's objection during defendant's closing argument on the issue of probable cause to make the arrest, and that the trial court's refusal to allow certain police reports into evidence as inadmissible hearsay was correct. The court held that defendant's adjudication as a habitual offender was not based on an unconstitutional application of an ex post facto cleansing period, but vacated the adjudication for an error patent, in that the state failed to introduce evidence to establish the date of defendant's discharge from prison for his prior felony conviction in order to prove that the &quot;cleansing period&quot; under La.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1361 and discrimination based on his handicap or disability in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 46:2254 and 51:2242.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was allegedly terminated from his probationary employment for failing to meet attendance standards. Instead of appealing to the Civil Service Commission (CSC), the employee brought an action alleging retaliatory discharge and discrimination. The court found that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claims. The employee's contention that application of the CSC's rules, enacted pursuant to La. Const. art. X, &sect; 10. broadened definition of discrimination and expanded its jurisdiction beyond its constitutional bounds was without merit. The authority to review the basis for a termination of a civil servant's employment was expressly and unambiguously assigned to the CSC, subject to the right of judicial review, pursuant to La. Const. art. X, &sect; 12(A). The court refused to find that there was concurrent jurisdiction over the employee's claims because that would result in unequal treatment of aggrieved civil service employees. Although the employee sought a money judgment rather than reinstatement, the district court still did not have jurisdiction. The application of the CSC rules was not in conflict with La. Const. art. X, &sect; 8(B).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the 11th Judicial District Court for the Parish of DeSoto (Louisiana), which had convicted her of forgery upon her plea of guilty, and sentenced her to the maximum 10 years at hard labor. Defendant argued that sentence was unconstitutionally excessive her sentence to the maximum 10 years at hard labor is constitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Inter alia, defendant plead guilty to one count of forgery and the trial court convicted defendant thereof. Defendant complained on appeal that her sentence to the maximum 10 years at hard labor was unconstitutionally excessive. On review, the court affirmed under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. The court found that defendant's criminal conduct was not adequately defined by one count of forgery because her propensity to commit thefts and forgeries was evident in her brief, but prolific, criminal history for the two years surrounding her seventeenth birthday. The court found that while other trial courts might have sentenced a young and single pregnant substance abuser to a lesser term of years, the 10-year sentence, even though the maximum for one count of forgery, was not an abuse of the trial court's discretion in this case nor was it shocking to the court's sense of justice. The court could not say that defendant's criminal conduct was not serious or that the punishment imposed on defendant would not achieve the legitimately recognized purpose of generally deterring other young members of society who might be inclined to commit similar thefts and forgeries.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and noted defendant's assertion that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and that his sentence was excessive. The court found that defendant's alleged violation of the plea agreement was based on the U.S. Attorney's failure to provide the trial court with a letter that attested to defendant's cooperation. Defendant also alleged that he pled to the charges in the indictment for purposes of cooperation but had no intention of being sentenced on those charges. The court held that defendant understood the terms and conditions of the plea agreement, and the U.S. Attorney's failure to provide the requisite letter because of the lack of defendant's total cooperation was not considered by the trial court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, a physician and his insurer, appealed an order of the Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of Rapides (Louisiana), which entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs, a mother, individually, and on behalf of her son, and awarded general damages to the mother and son and future medical benefits to the son. The order imposed a statutory cap to each plaintiff under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40.1299.42(B).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother, a gestational diabetic, was a patient of the physician and was diagnosed with preeclampsia. When she was delivering her son, a complication known as shoulder dyscotia arose and the physician directed the nurses to perform a maneuver on the mother in order to push the baby through the birth canal. The son sustained permanent injury to his shoulder nerves and lost use his left arm and hand. The trial court awarded general damages to the son, damages for loss of future earnings, and future medical benefits, and damages to the mother for loss of consortium. The trial court imposed statutory caps on each plaintiff under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.42(B)(1). The court affirmed because the finding that inappropriate fundal pressure was applied was not manifestly erroneous given the high likelihood of dystocia. The court affirmed the award for general damages and for future medical expenses to the son, but reversed the award of damages to the mother for loss of consortium. The mother's loss of consortium claim was a derivative claim of the son's injuries and therefore exceeded the statutory cap allowed for the child. The assessment of costs on defendants was not abusive.</SPAN></P>

It rejected a claim that it erred by reviewing the lower court's findings de novo because it found legal errors that triggered de novo review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The individuals alleged that the director searched their offices in violation of their right to privacy under U.S. Const. amend.

The trial court failed to specify which constitutional provisions were violated. The court reversed, holding that the office was also liable under state law and granted the individuals' application for a rehearing and clarification. Defendants were liable for damages because the searches violated federal provisions and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 5. The director was a state employee within the meaning of La. Rev. Stat.

The director was not entitled to qualified immunity for violations of state constitutional rights because he did not show that he had no knowledge of the legal standard for unreasonable searches. Defendants were not entitled to immunity under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 9:2798.1 because the director's acts were willful. The court reversed with respect to the grant of attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it was not error for the state to have delayed in producing a witness's criminal record under La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 609.1 where defendant could not have introduced evidence of, or questioned the witness about, a forcible rape charge against him. The court held that defendant's sentences were not excessive under La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20, and La. Code Crim. Proc.

The district attorney appealed and contended that although the statute required a filing to show cause with the Commissioner of Insurance, it did not restrict alternative methods of collection.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On remand from the Louisiana Supreme Court, the court was directed to consider whether plaintiff motorists proved negligence by the Department of Transportation and Development under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315 and, if so, what damages were due the motorists for their injuries sustained in their collision at a state highway intersection controlled by a malfunctioning traffic signal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The motorists' vehicles collided at a state highway intersection controlled by a traffic signal that showed green to both cross roads. The trial court initially found negligence sufficient for the Department's strict liability but that the motorists had not met the burden of proof of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2800 to show notice and an opportunity to repair. On appeal, the court ruled that &sect; 9:2800 was unconstitutional, but the higher court remanded, holding that where negligence had been found by the trial court, it was unnecessary to address &sect; 9:2800. In reversing the trial court on remand, the court ruled that it was required to sustain the trial court's finding of negligence in the absence of manifest error. The court applied the standard duty/risk negligence analysis in determining whether liability could be imposed under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315. The court found that the evidence established that the Department had a duty under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:193 to maintain its traffic signals, that the Department breached that duty, that the breach was the cause-in-fact of the injuries, and the harm was within the scope of protection of the duty that was breached.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment in favor of the Department and rendered judgment awarding damages to the motorists.</SPAN></P>

On appeal of his conviction and sentence for the rape and associated offenses, defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient, that the prosecutor referred to his failure to testify, that he was entitled to a new trial, and that his sentence was excessive. In affirming, the court analyzed the evidence in detail and found that, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of each of defendant's crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. The court ruled that the prosecutor's comments regarding the lack of rebuttal to the victim's testimony did not constitute indirect references to defendant's failure to take the stand because other witnesses were available for any possible rebuttal. The court found that the evidence failed to establish that a rape report, which referenced a previous rape by defendant, was examined by the jury before it was retrieved from the jury room and ruled that a new trial was not warranted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo, Louisiana, which sentenced defendant to two concurrent sentences of 10 years imprisonment at hard labor after he pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated incest in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:78.1. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash the bill of information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's victims were his 4-year-old daughter and his 16-year-old adopted sister. Defendant claimed that &sect; 14:78.1 was unconstitutionally vague because it did not include the element of consanguinity contained in the incest statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:78. The court found that the aggravated incest statute was not an enhanced penalty for incest prohibited under &sect; 14:78. Consanguinity was irrelevant to &sect; 14:78.1. The two statutes were wholly self-contained, and they punished acts plainly defined against persons clearly enumerated in a manner that notified the public of what conduct was prohibited. Defendant's contention that &sect; 14:78.1 was unconstitutionally vague and overly-broad because it failed to consider the offender's age and its relation to the victim's age was without merit because defendant failed to show how these factors were relevant to the prohibition of the conduct. The victim's age and the family relationship were the focus of &sect; 14:78.1. Finally, &sect; 14:78.1 was not shown to be overbroad because defendant did not assert a constitutionally protected right as a defense to the prosecution and because &sect; 14:78.1 affected harmful, criminal conduct rather than speech.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment denying defendant's motion to quash. Defendant's convictions and sentences were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the judgment of his conviction and sentence of the Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Ouachita (Louisiana) wherein a unanimous jury found defendant guilty as charged. He had been charged by bill of information with armed robbery in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64. He was sentenced as a habitual offender to 99 years at hard labor, without the benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant drove the getaway car for his girlfriend, who entered a convenience store with a gun and demanded the money from the cashier. After being pursued by police, defendant pulled over and surrendered. A holster was found on the car seat and a gun was recovered from the roadside. The state's evidence of defendant's prior armed robbery of another convenience store in Louisiana was admitted at trial. He urged that such evidence was admitted in error as it was not a &quot;signature&quot; type crime. In affirming defendant's conviction and sentence, the court concluded, inter alia, that the evidence of the prior armed robbery was properly admitted under La. Code Evid. 404B(1), as defendant's intent was at issue, the evidence of the prior crime was relevant to show intent, and the evidence of his identity in the prior crime was clear and convincing. Further, the prior armed robbery was sufficiently similar to the instant one. The two convenience store robberies were perpetrated within weeks of each other in locations adjacent to the same highway and were committed with a similar handgun. Thus, the probative value of the prior crime evidence outweighed the prejudice to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of defendant's conviction and sentence of armed robbery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the decision of the 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which convicted him for second-degree murder in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant's first trial resulted in a mistrial, he was subsequently convicted in another trial for second-degree murder. The court affirmed his conviction. Defendant was not deprived of a fair trial and an impartial jury with respect to the trial court's failure to allow defendant to exercise a peremptory challenge during the selection of the jury with respect to a particular African American juror because the trial court established a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination. The trial court noted defendant's pattern of elimination of black jurors, excluding all but one from the panel. In addition, the trial court considered the relevant fact that the victim was black and defendant was white. Further, defendant's explanation for his peremptory challenge was not particularly persuasive, as there was nothing on the record to support the argument that the potential juror was objectionable. The state's destruction of certain evidence, defendant's car, did not deprive him of access to exculpatory evidence because defendant did not demonstrate that the state acted in bad faith in destroying the car and comparable evidence was reasonably available.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant brothers appealed from a judgment of the Criminal District Court for Orleans Parish (Louisiana), which, following a bench trial, convicted the first brother of attempted possession with intent to distribute cocaine and the second brother of possession with intent to distribute cocaine. The court also reviewed their adjudication upon guilty pleas under the multiple offender statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police officers were on routine patrol in a marked a car when they observed the car that defendants were in disregard a stop sign.

Both defendants testified that the cocaine all belonged to one, but not the other, and a third person who was in the vehicle. Defendants were represented by the same counsel. On review, the court affirmed the conviction and found, inter alia, that defendants were not prejudiced by being represented by the same attorney, the officers lawfully seized the cocaine pursuant to the &quot;plain view&quot; exception to the warrant requirement. However, the court held that the trial court erred because it did not fully advise defendants of their rights at the multiple bill hearing. The transcript of the multiple offender proceeding established that the trial court did not advise either defendant of the right to remain silent, and other than the guilty pleas, nothing was presented in to link either defendant to the convictions evidenced by the certified copies of convictions the prosecution provided to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the convictions that the trial court entered on the drug charges, but it vacated the multiple offender adjudications and remand for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Twenty-First Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of Livingston (Louisiana), which convicted him of the aggravated rape and the murder of his estranged wife.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant allegedly raped his wife at knifepoint and then killed her the next day. The court found no merit in defendant's assignments of error. In particular, the trial court did not err in refusing to allow defendant to exhume his wife's body because speculation that viewing her skull could help determine the caliber of bullet that passed through it was not a sufficient reason for such a drastic measure. Demonstrative evidence was sufficiently identified to be admitted at trial where the sheriff had told the wife to bring her clothes and the knife with her when she filed charges; a witness had helped the wife pack the items in a bag; and the bag was eventually turned over, unaltered, to the sheriff's office. The jury could infer that the knife was the one used in the rape. The court did not err in excluding the responsive verdicts of simple rape and attempted simple rape because there was no evidence of any of the special circumstances enumerated in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:43A(1), (2), or (3). Further, sexual battery under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:43.1 was properly excluded as a responsive verdict because it only applied to a victim who was not the spouse of the offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences for murder and aggravated rape, but the case was remanded to allow the trial court to correct the minute entry to reflect that defendant was to be given credit for any time served.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the sentence was not excessive in light of defendant's extensive criminal history as well as his tendency to continue to commit crimes while a variety of criminal charges were pending against him and the reprehensible nature of his crime.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged by bill of information as a habitual offender, in violation of La. Rev. Stat.

At the hearing, defendant admitted to the two convictions without being advised of his right to remain silent. However, the trial court did not rely solely on defendant's admissions to the two convictions, but also provided the testimony of defendant's probation officer, and the trial records from defendant's prior convictions. The court therefore concluded that the trial court's failure to comply with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(D)(1) was a harmless error and did not require a remand of the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, a claimant's former attorney, sought review of a decision from the Office of Workers' Compensation, Parish of Evangeline (Louisiana), which dismissed his action against appellees, the claimant, his new attorney, the employer, and the attorney of the employer and the insurer, to recover his attorney's fees in a workers' compensation case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">One year after the former attorney's fees were approved in accordance with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1141, appellees entered into a settlement judgment that deprived the former attorney of his attorney's fee privilege. The former attorney was not notified about the settlement proceedings and did not participate. Although the court found that the settlement judgment was a violation of the former attorney's due process rights, the court concluded that it could not grant the former attorney's request to declare the judgment a nullity. The former attorney could not raise nullity under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1272(B) because he was not a party to the settlement, and he was also prohibited from seeking the nullity of the settlement by the jurisprudence based on La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:218(A), which governed his attorney's privilege. The court, however, determined that the former attorney stated a cause of action for an unjust enrichment claim against the employer and its insurer. Additionally, the former attorney's entitlement to attorney's fees from the claimant sprang from their employment contract and was unaffected by the settlement agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment that dismissed the former attorney's action to recover his attorney's fees. The court remanded the action for further proceedings and for entry of a judgment in favor of the former attorney and against the employer and its insurer in the amount of the former attorney's approved fee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged by bill of information with one count of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(A)(1). Defendant claimed that the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, was insufficient to sustain a guilty verdict. Defendant also contended that the imposition of the maximum sentence was unconstitutionally excessive and that the reasons given for such a sentence were inadequate. The court found that the only issue contested by defendant was whether or not she intended to distribute the cocaine. Shortly after her arrest, defendant gave a statement to police that she intended to sell the drugs. The statement made by defendant was direct proof that she intended to sell the cocaine. The court also found that the maximum sentence was appropriate only in a case that involved the most serious violations of the subject offense and the most egregious and blameworthy offenders within the class. Although the trial court's factors indicated that defendant was involved in the drug trade, the court did not find that they placed defendant in the class of the most egregious offenders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (DWF) and its agents, sought review of the decision of the Seventh Judicial District Court for the Parish of Concordia (Louisiana), which awarded punitive damages and attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and compensatory damages, including lost profits and mental anguish, that resulted from the constructive seizure of the alligator and catfish farms of appellee farmers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During a search, pursuant to warrant, DWF agents discovered untagged alligators skins, in violation of of the La. Alligator Regs. R. F(7), H(1). In order to preserve the untagged skins, the DWF constructively seized the farmers' alligator and catfish farms on the advice of its attorney. As a result of the constructive seizure, the farmers filed for bankruptcy and sought damages. The lower court awarded the farmers punitive and compensatory damages, as well as attorney's fees. The court reversed the award of punitive damages and attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 because neither the DWF nor its agents, acting in their official capacity, were &quot;persons&quot; under &sect; 1983. Further, the individual agents were entitled to qualified immunity under &sect; 1983 and to good faith immunity under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:65(A) because the agents' actions were reasonable and they did not violate any clearly established legal rule. Moreover, the award of future loss profits for the catfish operation was improper when the farmers could operate that farm. The court affirmed the remaining awards because the extent and duration of the initially valid seizure ultimately made it unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the lower court's award of punitive damages, attorney's fees, and compensatory damages against the agents. The court also reversed the award of future loss profits on the catfish operation. The judgment was reformed in order to enter a dollar amount of all costs. In all other aspects, the lower court's judgment was affirmed, in favor of the farmers.</SPAN></P>

The parish and the department of inspection and code enforcement filed an exception of no cause of action based on La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4773(D) and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2798.1. Despite the property owner's contention that the foregoing statutes were constitutional, the trial court granted the exception of no cause of action and dismissed the property owner's suit. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err in failing to address the constitutionality of the foregoing statutes. However, the court found that the trial court erred in failing to allow the property owner to amend his petition pursuant to La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 934 because, by amending the petition to add allegations of the unconstitutionality of the foregoing statutes, the property owner could have removed the grounds of the exception.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Fortieth Judicial District Court, Parish of St. John the Baptist (Louisiana), which convicted him of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute more than 200 and less than 400 grams of cocaine in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967A and sentenced him as a second felony offender to 20 years at hard labor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When police officers informed defendant that he was wanted on outstanding warrants, he fled and was subdued by three officers. While handcuffing defendant, an officer saw cocaine clutched in his hand and felt a bulge in his sleeve from which money spilled out. On appeal, the court affirmed that defendant's conviction of possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute under &sect; 40:967A was supported by sufficient evidence that he possessed a large amount of cash and over 200 grams of cocaine, an amount that was inconsistent with personal use and had a high street value, which were seized incident to his warrantless arrest. Defendant waived the irregularity in the arraignment and was not prejudiced by counsel's failure to object to a charge that instructed on all elements of the crime. The court held that the multiple bill conviction was valid because the state produced a perfect transcript of his prior guilty plea. The court was prevented from amending the illegally lenient sentence that should have been imposed without parole because the state did not appeal. The court directed the trial court to inform defendant of the prescriptive period for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's sentence and conviction of possession of cocaine.

The executrix contended that the recitals in the will were sufficient to effect disinherison under La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 5 and La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1493.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 9:2501, which abolished the forced heirship of persons over the age of 23, did not apply retroactively because to the decedent's will because: (1) he died prior to the statute's effective date; (2) his will treated his children as not forced heirs under former La.

Reversing the trial court's dismissal of the executrix's petition for possession, the court held that there could be a reduction of the donation to the executrix under La. Civ.

The trial court awarded the victim $ 725,000 and awarded her four adult children $ 25,000 consortium damages each. The DOTD sought review contending that the awards were excessive. The court affirmed the victim's award, but reduced the consortium awards to $ 5,000. The court held that a trier of fact had great discretion in awarding damages, which should only be changed if such discretion were abused.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Department of Public Safety and Corrections (Department) sought review of a decision of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which entered a judgment permanently enjoining the Department from requiring a convicted sex offender to register as and give notice of such under the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:542 and 15:574.4(H).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The felon was convicted of molestation of a juvenile. Due to a prior conviction of indecent behaviour with a juvenile, he was sentenced as a habitual offender. The felon was released due to a diminution of his sentence based upon good time credit pursuant to La Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:571.5, which, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:571.5(A), was as if released on parole. A condition of release was that he register as a sex offender pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:542 and give notification of his status under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:574.4(H). The felon filed suit and the trial court granted a permanent injunction enjoining the Department from requiring the registration or notice. The court affirmed as to the prohibition against the imposition of the &sect; 15:542 requirements finding that because the felon's failure to register would expose him to additional penalties than that authorized for the crime when it was committed. The court reversed as to the prohibition against the imposition of the &sect; 15:574.4(H) requirements because even though the statute became effective after the offenses were committed, it did not create a new offense for a sex offender's failure to comply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the lower court was affirmed insofar as it prohibited the imposition of the La. Rev.

Ann. &sect; 15:574.4(H) sex offender notification requirements upon the felon.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant's specific intent to commit rape under &sect; 14:42.1 was proven by sufficient evidence that he did not rob the victim but brutally beat her on the roadside at night, removed her pants, and dragged her to a dark area. The doctor's testimony, that the victim's abrasions were consistent with being dragged, was sufficient to prove that she was forcibly seized and carried from one place to another to constitute kidnapping under &sect; 14:44.1. The court found that the trial court did not err in allowing the jury, during deliberations, to view a photograph depicting the nature and extent of the victim's injuries; allowing the victim to testify, based on her perception, that the attacker intended to rape her; denying a motion for a new trial and mistrial; and deviating from the sentencing guidelines. The court held that the kidnapping statute was not unconstitutionally vague and found no double jeopardy violation under the same evidence and elements tests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the 19th Judicial District Court in and for East Baton Rouge Parish (Louisiana), which sentenced him to five years at hard labor after he pleaded guilty to sexual molestation of a juvenile, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;14:81.2. He complained that the trial court sentenced him on a defective presentence investigation (PSI) report.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defense counsel obtained a copy of the PSI on the morning of sentencing and admitted to looking at it only briefly. The trial court sentenced defendant and later denied his motion for reconsideration. Defendant contended that the omission of statements from defendant's psychologist, his mother, and his employer rendered the PSI defective. In affirming the judgment, the court acknowledged that such statements were properly part of the social history elements of a PSI, which under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 875(A)(1) the trial court could consider in sentencing. The court held, however, that failure to consider these statements did not void the sentence. The court also held that defendant failed to preserve his claim that the failure to provide the PSI to him until the morning of the sentencing hearing was error, because defendant had not objected to this at or before the hearing. The court also held that defendant's sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive, noting that it was only one-third of the maximum statutory sentence, and that defendant exercised control and authority over the victim, his daughter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was stopped for a traffic offense. After a search of his person, a crack cocaine pipe was found, and defendant was arrested. Analysis of the residue in the crack pipe revealed the presence of cocaine. Defendant was charged by the city with possession of drug paraphernalia, to which defendant pleaded guilty. The state then charged defendant with possession of a controlled dangerous substance, namely cocaine, based on the residue in the pipe. Defendant eventually pleaded guilty, and was sentenced. Defendant filed a motion to quash the prosecution for possession of cocaine based on double jeopardy grounds and argued that his plea of guilty to the charge for possession of drug paraphernalia precluded the state from prosecuting him for possession of cocaine. The trial court denied the motion, and defendant appealed. The court reversed the conviction and held that under the Louisiana &quot;same evidence&quot; test, the two offenses were the same under a plea of double jeopardy. The presence of the residual crack cocaine served to prove both that defendant intended to possess drug paraphernalia and that the pipe was actually drug paraphernalia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant husband challenged a decision of the Twenty-Second Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of St. Tammany (Louisiana), which recognized appellee children as forced heirs and awarded them full ownership of one-half of the decedent's estate. The husband alleged that the trial court erred in finding that he was not entitled to a life usufruct over the forced portion of the decedent's estate without the necessity of posting bond.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Decedent died testate survived by her husband and two children from a prior marriage. She bequeathed to her husband the entirety of her estate in full ownership and named him testamentary executor. Decedent wrote her testament after the abolishment of forced heirship for all competent children over the age of 23. She failed to change her will after the law was declared unconstitutional and died before forced heirship was abolished. The children filed a petition to annul the probated testament. The trial court recognized them as forced heirs and awarded them full ownership of one-half of the estate. The court amended and affirmed, finding that it was decedent's intent that the husband be given the maximum permitted under the law. The court held that the maximum she could give under the law at the time without impinging on her children's legitime was a life usufruct over community and separate property. The court found that La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1502 only required a reduction to the point where the bequest no longer impinged upon the legitime; thus, the best way to effectuate the decedent's intent was to hold that the husband was entitled to a life usufruct over the forced portion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The part of the trial court's judgment awarding the children their forced portion in full ownership was amended to award them the naked ownership of their forced portion. The judgment was further amended to award the husband, in addition to the disposable portion in full ownership, an usufruct of the forced portion for life. The court remanded for a determination of the appropriate security required.</SPAN></P>

The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the taxpayer. Appellants challenged the decision. The court agreed with the trial court. The court found that the language in the original statute recognizing the distinction between pulpwood and timber by the measurements used, by the cord for pulpwood and by the 1,000 feet log scale for trees and timber, was applicable to the current statute. The general rule of interpretation was that provisions of an original act which were repeated in the body of an amendatory act, either in the same or equivalent words, were considered to be a continuation without change of the original law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the judgment of her conviction and sentence from the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana). She was granted an appeal in 1983 after her conviction of simple possession of pentazocine and subsequently was adjudicated and sentenced as a multiple offender, but she escaped and was absent from Louisiana until 1993. She was returned to custody and filed a motion for the lodging of her appeal record, which was lost.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's appeal from her conviction was granted prior to her illegal escape from custody, whereby she was absent from Louisiana for 10 years. When she returned she sought to lodge her appeal, but her conviction was so old that the trial records, including the trial transcript, had been lost. Therefore the facts of the case were unknown to the court. Defendant urged that her constitutional right to appeal had been denied because the trial transcript was unavailable. She argued that, because she did not specifically waive her right of appeal, her appeal should have proceeded in her absence after it was granted. The court affirmed the judgment of her conviction and her adjudication and sentencing as a habitual offender, as her 10-year absence after her illegal escape constituted a waiver of her right of appeal. Also, the court opined that her prolonged absence after her escape made it impossible for the district court to notify her during the time that her appeal could not be lodged due to lost records, and thus she had waived such notice. The court declined to dismiss the appeal, although it viewed dismissal as a justifiable option.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Section D (Louisiana). The trial court convicted defendant of two counts of armed robbery in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64. On remand from the state supreme court, the trial court resentenced defendant on count one to 60 years at hard labor and sentenced defendant on count two as a multiple offender to 60 years at hard labor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury found that defendant was guilty of two counts of armed robbery. The trial court resentenced defendant on remand from the state supreme court. The court affirmed. Because the full transcript of the evidentiary portion of the trial was made part of the appellate record, the absence of the jury instruction transcript did not deny defendant full appellate review. Defendant's claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the issue of identification lacked merit; even if the issue had been raised, defendant's convictions would not have been reversed. The jury was well aware of the discrepancy in a victim's identifications at a photographic lineup and at a physical lineup, and the reliability of her positive identification of defendant at the physical lineup and at trial was for the jury to decide. The trial court's reimposition of a 60-year sentence was not excessive in light of defendant's conviction for another armed robbery committed in the same area and in a similar fashion. Because less than five years had elapsed between defendant's conviction for simple burglary and the present offenses, the state was not required to prove discharge from the prior offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State sought a writ of certiorari and prohibition requesting review of a decision of the Criminal District Court (Louisiana), which deviated from imposing a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence on defendant who was a multiple offender and instead imposed a six year sentence at hard labor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State invoked the court's supervisory jurisdiction to review a multiple offender sentence. Specifically, the State argued that the trial court failed to state adequate reasons to support imposition of a six year sentence at hard labor for defendant who was convicted of a third felony offense, rather than the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. The defendant was convicted of forgery, and had previous convictions for unauthorized use of a movable and a simple robbery. The State argued that under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:529.1 (A)(2)(b)(ii), 14:2(13)(y), and 14:72, the mandatory sentence was appropriate. Upon review, the court held that the district court properly justified the lower sentence by noting the nature of the past felony offenses. The court noted that the district court held that a sentence of life imprisonment would constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the application for a writ of certiorari and prohibition, and affirmed the sentence given to defendant by the criminal district court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff owners appealed a judgment of the 25th Judicial District Court, Plaquemines Parish, No. 31-357, Division &quot;A&quot; (Louisiana), which maintained the exception of no cause of action filed by defendant Orleans Parish Levee Board (board), denied the owners' motion for a new trial, and dismissed their class action to require the return of royalties earned on the owners' expropriated property after the effective date of 1984 La. Acts 233 (act).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board expropriated the owners' property as part of a spillway. Because the board obtained a restraining order against the enforcement of the act, which required it to return the property to the owners, applications for the transfer of title were not made available until 1987. The court held that the trial court erred in maintaining the board's exception of no cause of action to the owners' claim for monies representing revenues generated from their property after the effective date of the act and before the 1992 transfer of title and by denying their motion for a new trial. The court held that equity dictated that the board, whose attack on the constitutionality of the act delayed the availability of applications for years, should not have been allowed to benefit in revenues from its decision not to follow the legislative mandate. The court held that, under La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 14(B)(4), the board had no right to the expropriated property and revenues generated during the application process after the effective date of the act, which was not repealed by its amendments and which declared that a public and necessary purpose for the expropriation no longer existed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded the judgment maintaining the board's exception of no cause of action to the owners' action for royalties recovered by the board on their expropriated property.</SPAN></P>

In addition, the court stated that a police officer's testimony discussing defendant's alias was not an unambiguous reference to other crimes, and defendant's right to a speedy trial was not violated because any delays in the trial was brought by the defense and the prosecution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff clients filed suit against defendants, accountants, their firm, its insurer, and a partnership's sales representative, alleging several causes of action including accounting malpractice, violations of the Louisiana Blue Sky Laws, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:701 et seq., and breach of fiduciary duty. The clients appealed the decisions of the District Court for the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) granting summary judgment for the defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An accountant of the firm recommended that the clients invest in a partnership to receive tax benefits after preparing their tax returns. The clients purchased an interest in the proposed partnership from the sales representative. Several years later, the Internal Revenue Service notified the clients that it was investigating the investment and then disallowed the tax benefits they claimed in connection with the partnership. The clients sought recovery after they were required to pay back taxes, plus penalties and interest. The defendants were awarded summary judgment based upon their argument that the claims were prescribed. Although both parties based their arguments regarding the malpractice claim on La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5604, the court held that the statute did not apply to the claim because the malpractice claim had prescribed prior to the enactment of the statute. The court held that the claims under the Louisiana Blue Sky Laws were also prescribed because it was filed more than two years after the sale of the partnership interest. The court found that there was no basis for suspending or interrupting the prescriptive periods and that there was no breach of fiduciary duty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court decisions finding that the clients failed to filed their times within the applicable prescriptive periods.

On appeal, defendant claimed that the jury instruction providing that &sect; 14:62.4 was a lesser included offense of simple burglary was error on the facts of the case and that his sentence was excessive. The court affirmed the conviction and the sentence. Defendant's conviction was based on a break-in at a church, and he claimed that a church was not a business as contemplated in &sect; 14:62.4. Under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 814(44), unauthorized entry of a place of business was a responsive verdict to simple burglary. The court held that a church was a place of business as contemplated in La. Rev. Stat.

It was within the range for second felony offenders pursuant to La. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo, Louisiana, claiming that the sentence of three years at hard labor for the offense of indecent behavior with a juvenile was excessive and showed little regard for the Louisiana Sentencing Guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with molestation of a juvenile arising from having sexual intercourse with his minor step-daughter on numerous occasions. He entered a plea of guilty to the offense of indecent behavior with a juvenile, a lesser included offense, and was sentenced to three years at hard labor, with credit for time served. On appeal, defendant claimed that the sentence was excessive and showed no regard for the Louisiana Sentencing Guidelines. The court affirmed the conviction and the sentence. The record showed that the trial court properly considered the Louisiana Sentencing Guidelines but was within its discretion in rejecting them. The trial court determined that an upward deviation was warranted in light of defendant's position of authority over the victim and the numerous occurrences of the offense. The court also held that the sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive. Defendant had abused a position of trust and responsibility, repeatedly committed the criminal actions, was sentenced to less than half of the maximum sentence for the crime originally charged, and was not ordered to pay a fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for indecent behavior with a juvenile and the sentence imposed as a result.</SPAN></P>

The voters filed a petition seeking to compel the Council to consider the supplemental petitions as part of the original petition and further, to compel the registrar to inspect the signatures on the supplemental petitions for the purpose of verifying the number of registered voters. In response, the Council filed an exception of no cause of action on the grounds that plaintiffs were seeking the enforcement of an action that was purely discretionary. The trial court maintained the exception. On appeal the court held that for the purpose of amending the Charter, the City Council was not required to call an election in accordance with the procedure outlined La.

The court found that the State met its burden of proof regarding defendant's adjudication as a fourth habitual offender and that defendant did not present any affirmative evidence of a procedural irregularity or infringement of his rights at any of the prior guilty plea proceedings. The court also concluded that it could not say the sentence imposed on defendant was excessive based on the circumstances of the offense, defendant's prior record, and the likelihood of recidivism. The court found that the trial court erred in failing to give defendant credit for time served prior to the execution of the sentence, pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 882A.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a 16-year-old boy, contested his manslaughter conviction by a jury and the 33-year sentence imposed by the trial court. Defendant was driving a car whose passenger, his co-defendant, fatally shot the occupant of another car. On appeal, the court held that defendant acted as a principal in the crime, even though he was acquitted of a charge of second-degree murder and convicted of manslaughter instead. The prosecutor did not directly comment on defendant's failure to testify in contravention of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 770 by stating in closing arguments that defendant had been afforded &quot;the right to take the stand.&quot; Any indirect reference to the defendant's failure to testify was harmless. The state was merely required to prove that defendant intended to frighten the victim rather than kill him in order to convict of manslaughter under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:31. Although the maximum sentence imposed was harsh, the trial court weighed both aggravating and mitigating factors and did not abuse its discretion in holding that defendant was a &quot;menace to society.&quot; The sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer, a Class II railroad, contested the state tax commission's method of valuating ad valorem taxes on its operations, arguing that the valuation method unfairly penalized Class II railroads as opposed to Class I railroads. On appeal, the court held that the methods the commission used to determine the fair market value of the taxpayer's property violated the uniformity requirements of La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 18, because the classifications &quot;Class I&quot; and &quot;Class II&quot; railroads were arbitrary and discriminatory. The classifications also violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The commission's method of valuation also impermissibly included intangible assets specifically exempted from ad valorem taxation by La. Const. Art. VII, &sect;&sect; 18, 21, and the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976. Finally, the court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1709, the intangible property exemption statute, conflicted with La Const. art. VII, &sect; 21, and was therefore invalid. However, the commission was not obliged to adopt the accounting methods or capitalization rate proposed by the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed in part the commission's tax assessment of the taxpayer railroad and remanded for reassessment of ad valorem taxes for the year 1993.</SPAN></P>
