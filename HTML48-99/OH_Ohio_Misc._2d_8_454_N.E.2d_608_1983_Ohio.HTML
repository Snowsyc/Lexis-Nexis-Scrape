<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant moved to dismiss a complaint charging him with the purposeful disruption of a lawful meeting in violation of Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.12 for purposefully disrupting a lawful city council meeting. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charge under Ohio R. Crim. P. 29(A), contending that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense. The record showed that the disruption started when the mayor of the village made an inappropriate remark during the course of the meeting to defendant's wife, who was a member of the council. Defendant, a spectator at the meeting, came to his wife's defense, challenged the mayor, and told him not to insult his wife. The mayor adjourned the meeting and had the police arrest defendant. The court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the charge and concluded that there was absolutely no evidence that defendant's intention was to interfere with the due conduct of the meeting. There was no evidence that the mayor ruled defendant out of order, and defendant could not be deemed to have committed an act which caused a substantial interference with the due conduct of the meeting. There was also no evidence that defendant caused members of the council to absent themselves from the meeting.</SPAN></P>
