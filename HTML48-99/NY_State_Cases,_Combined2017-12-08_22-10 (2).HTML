<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Judgment of the Supreme Court, Suffolk County, rendered September 20, 1982, modified, on the law, by vacating the convictions for criminal facilitation in the fourth degree and the sentences imposed thereon and the counts of grand larceny in the third degree are dismissed.  As so modified, judgment affirmed and matter remitted to the Supreme Court, Suffolk County, for further proceedings pursuant to CPL 460.50 (subd 5).  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Supreme Court in Suffolk County (New York) convicted defendant of a scheme to defraud in the first degree, 10 counts of criminal facilitation in the fourth degree, and 11 counts of altering a mileage registering device. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the conclusion of the trial testimony, the trial court found that the People failed to prove the 15 counts of grand larceny alleged in the indictment and decided that these counts could not be presented to the jury. The court decided to submit 15 counts of criminal facilitation in the fourth degree in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 115.00 as lesser included offenses. The State and defense counsel consented to the trial court's decision. The People alleged that the grand larceny charges were premised on allegations of acting in concert or accessorial liability, that the counts of criminal facilitation were properly submitted to the jury as lesser included offenses, and that defendant waived any objections to submitting the criminal facilitation counts to the jury. The court held that the trial court committed reversible error in submitting the counts of criminal facilitation to the jury. Criminal facilitation was not a lesser included offense to grand larceny. The trial court lacked jurisdiction to submit the criminal facilitation counts to the jury. Defendant was powerless to waive the jurisdictional requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the judgment of the trial court by vacating defendant's convictions and sentences imposed for criminal facilitation in the fourth degree and by dismissing the counts for grand larceny in the third degree. As modified, the court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences. The court remitted to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Presentment to Jury of Crime Not Formally Charged -- Waiver</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The submission to a jury of an alleged crime which is neither expressed in the accusatory instrument nor a lesser included offense to any charge in the accusatory instrument goes to the subject matter jurisdiction of the court, and objection thereto may not be waived by the defendant; moreover, the manner or form of a defendant's purported waiver is irrelevant and the defendant is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  powerless to confer on a court the authority to prosecute him for a crime without an appropriate accusatory instrument. Accordingly, where defendant was convicted in a superior court of 10 counts of criminal facilitation in the fourth degree, a misdemeanor which is not a lesser included offense to any charges he was formally accused of, without ever having been indicted for criminal facilitation or formally charged with those crimes by superior court information or otherwise, the court was without jurisdiction to consider criminal facilitation despite the fact that defendant consented to its presentment to the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Lesser Included Offense -- Criminal Facilitation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A crime is not a lesser included offense unless in all circumstances, not only in those presented in the particular case, it is impossible to commit the greater crime without concomitantly, by the same conduct, committing the lesser offense.  Accordingly, counts of criminal facilitation in the fourth degree were improperly submitted to the jury as lesser included offenses of charges against defendant of grand larceny in the third degree despite the fact that the latter charges may have been premised&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on allegations of acting in concert, or accessorial liability; the distinction between principal and accessory has no bearing on the definition of the crimes of grand larceny charged in the indictments; moreover, it is possible to be an accessory to a crime without being a facilitator.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff city court judge (judge) appealed an order of the Supreme Court for Westchester County (New York), which granted summary judgment to defendants, Administrative Judge and Chief Administrator of the Courts of the State of New York and Administrative Board of the Judicial Conference of the State of New York, in the judge's action for a declaration that he was entitled to the same pay as other city court judges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judge was paid a salary lower than that of city court judges in certain other cities. The judge brought an action against defendants for a declaration that N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 39 was unconstitutional insofar as it promulgated unfavorable salary differentials among city court judges. The judge also sought a retroactive money award. Defendants brought a summary judgment motion, alleging that because the judge retired after bringing the action, the issue of prospective relief was moot and the issue of retroactive relief should be before the claims court. The trial court granted the motion, and the judge appealed. The court reversed, holding that the judge's claim for retroactive pay was ancillary to, and dependent on, a favorable judgment on the issue of &sect; 39's constitutionality. While claims against the state seeking money damages were normally brought in the claims court, a declaratory judgment action in the trial court was an appropriate vehicle for challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 39.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that the sentences imposed upon defendants of concurrent indeterminate terms of five years to life imprisonment, upon their convictions of two class A-I felonies, were violative of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.00(3)(a)(cl)(i). The trial court's finding that the statutorily mandated indeterminate minimum sentences of 15 years were so grossly disproportionate to the crimes of which defendants were convicted so as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment is unsupported by the record and was error. Defendants were convicted of possessing and selling one pound of cocaine and apparently were &quot;dealers&quot;. Because the quantity of the controlled substance found on defendants was substantially greater than the minimum required for a class A felony, there was no support for a finding that defendant's case was one of the rare cases on its particular facts that might justify finding that the applicable sentencing provision was unconstitutional as applied to defendants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant state superintendent of insurance sought review of an order of the Supreme Court at Special Term, New York County (New York) that converted a proceeding brought pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 to a declaratory judgment action, denied its motion for summary judgment, and directed that a trial be held, in an action regarding N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 30.2(a)(1), (3), (4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff insurer, as a foreign life insurance company doing business in the state, was subject to regulation by the superintendent pursuant to N.Y. Ins. Law art. 9-A. The insurer sought a declaratory ruling for permission to conduct a seven-day conference for its top production agents to be held in Mexico. The superintendent denied permission on the ground that the proposed conference would violate N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 30.2(a)(1), (3), (4). The trial court construed the action as seeking a declaration that the regulation was unconstitutional or inconsistent with N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 213, and it sua sponte converted the action to a declaratory judgment pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 103(c). On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that the insurer's plan did not qualify as a fundamental constitutional right and that the regulation did not proceed along suspect lines. The regulation was not subject to a finding of invidious discrimination but was reasonably related to a legitimate state interest. The court entered a judgment that the regulation was not violative of the insurer's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order of the trial court, which converted the insurer's action for a declaratory ruling to an action for declaratory judgment and ordered that a trial be held regarding a regulation for insurance conferences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Appeal as of Right -- Order Denying Declaration in Favor of Regulation's Validity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action to vacate a determination of the Superintendent of Insurance that a conference proposed by petitioner would, if held, violate a rule of the Insurance Department, brought pursuant to CPLR article 78 and converted by court order to a declaratory judgment action, the petitioner's contention that said order, insofar as it&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  directs a trial to resolve factual issues, is not appealable as of right because it is an order in an article 78 proceeding is without merit.  To the extent it denied a declaration in favor of the regulation's validity, the order is appealable as of right. ( CPLR 5701, subd [a], par 2.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Regulation of Educational Conferences Conducted by Life Insurance Companies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  11 NYCRR 30.2, which prescribes time, cost and geographical limitations on educational conferences conducted by life insurance companies, does not deny petitioner life insurance company due process or equal protection under the Federal or State Constitutions on the ground that its cost limitation has a harsher impact on petitioner than on other life insurance companies by virtue of petitioner's allegedly unique and cost-efficient operation.  Petitioner's plan to educate its agents for seven days in Acapulco, Mexico, at a cost of 31.6% of the first year commissions needed to qualify an agent for attendance does not qualify as a fundamental constitutional right; nor is the regulation's application of a firm 10% cost limitation on agency conference expenses to all&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the life insurance companies doing business in New York subject to a finding of invidious discrimination. The regulation, as a matter of law, is reasonably related to and supportive of a legitimate State interest in fostering economy in the operation of life insurance companies.  Moreover, the limitations prescribed by the regulation are not to be construed as starting points for carving out &quot;reasonable&quot; exceptions and extensions.  </SPAN></P>

Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 55-b(2). The Authority imposed a suspension and bond claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, petitioner asserted that the statute violated the Sherman Antitrust Act in that it fostered and promoted restraint of trade and price fixing, thereby eliminating competition. The court found that the Supreme Court set forth two criteria for antitrust immunity. First, the challenged restraint must be one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy; second, the policy must be actively supervised by the state itself. Here, the first criterion was concededly met and with regard to the second criteria, the court found that because the statute was administered by the State Liquor Authority, an agency of the State of New York, it was &quot;compelled by direction of the state acting as a sovereign&quot; and immune from the Sherman Act. However, the court ruled that the penalty imposed upon the distributor was so grave in its impact that it was disproportionate to the misconduct. The distributor co-operated fully in the investigation and the violation was unintentional. The improper pricing continued for only one week and there was no evidence that the violation would be continued or repeated in the future. Consequently, a fine was a more appropriate penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded for reconsideration by the for reconsideration of the penalty imposed, and otherwise confirmed the Authority's decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner mother sought review of the order from respondent State Commissioner of Social Services (New York), which affirmed a decision of a county Department of Social Services to deny a grant of emergency assistance for needy families with children to the mother to buy a heating unit for the family home to replace one that had failed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the heating unit in a family's home broke, the mother applied to the county Department of Social Services for emergency assistance to needy families with children for a grant to obtain a new unit. The Department denied the request and the Commissioner affirmed the denial under N.Y. Comp. Code R. &amp; Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 372.4(b). The mother brought an action under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 to review the Commissioner's determination. The court granted the mother's petition and annulled the Commissioner's affirmation. The court held that N.Y. Comp. Code R. &amp; Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 372.4(b) was invalid and void because it conflicted with N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 131-a. The breakdown of a home heating unit constituted destitution and was an emergency situation under N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 350-j. It did not matter that the mother borrowed the money to buy a heating unit. But the court also held that a $ 500 limitation on such assistance did not violate equal protection because there was a rational basis for the limitation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the mother's petition and annulled the Commissioner's order affirming the county Department Of Social Services' denial of grant of emergency assistance to needy families with children to the mother to replace her broken heating unit. The court remanded the case to the county Department of Social Services, noting that a regulatory limitation of $ 500 on the grant was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant state liquor authority challenged the judgment from the Supreme Court at Special Term, Suffolk County (New York), which overturned its condition of requiring appellee liquor licensee to permanently seal access to an unlicensed game room as a condition to the issuance of an eating place beer license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The licensee argued that the authority's determination requiring it to permanently seal access to an unlicensed game room as a condition to the issuance of an eating place beer license was arbitrary and capricious. The trial court found the condition to be based on speculation or supposition of future problems and an unconstitutional denial of equal protection of the law. The trial court relied upon affidavits submitted by the licensee's attorney stating that other of the licensee's establishments with attached game rooms were issued licenses without the imposition of a sealing requirement. The court upheld the authority's determination because its imposition of the condition was not without sound basis in reason and without regard to the facts. The court disregarded the licensee's purported &quot;proof&quot; because it conflicted with the record and the trial court erred in considering it. Lastly, the court held that the licensee had no inherent right to engage in the business of selling intoxicating liquors.Accordingly, the court reversed the order and dismissed the proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant natural mother filed an action in the Westchester County Surrogate's Court (New York) to revoke her consent, given pursuant to N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 115-b, to the adoption of her son by respondent adoptive parents. The surrogate's court determined that the interests of the child were best served by adoption and denied the natural mother's request to revoke her consent. The mother appealed, alleging that &sect; 115-b was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother signed a form drafted pursuant to &sect; 115-b after obtaining advice of counsel consenting to the adoption of her son. The form indicated that the consent was irrevocable after 30-days from commencement of the adoption proceedings. Six days after the adoption proceedings began, the mother attempted to revoke her consent. The surrogate's court held a hearing pursuant to &sect; 115-b to determine whether the best interests of the child would best be served by adoption or return of the child to the mother. During the revocation hearing the mother's counsel admitted that the mother was not misled by the consent form that revocation was subject to a hearing on the best interests of the child. On appeal, the court found that the mother's counsel's admission was conclusive on the mother. She had suffered no injury in fact or prejudice from the allegedly misleading language in the consent form and therefore had no standing to raise the issue of the constitutionality of the statute. The plain language of the statute did not require that the consent form contain the language that revocation was subject to a hearing to determine the best interests of the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment that the interests of the child were best served by adoption was affirmed. The mother lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute at issue.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, following a hearing at which it was determined that the best interests of the infant would be served by his adoption by petitioners, the Surrogate properly denied the natural mother's application to withdraw her extrajudicial consent to the adoption.  </SPAN></P>

V, &sect; 6, which required competitive examinations for civil service if practicable. The court affirmed the entry of summary judgment for defendants. Legislation carried a strong presumption of constitutionality. It was within the province of the legislature to determine that a serious disruption in court services would result from the immediate use of competitive examinations to fill the positions occupied by provisional employees and that the best solution would be to enact the &quot;cover in&quot; law at issue.</SPAN></P>

Penal Law &sect; 70.06(1)(b) defined as a conviction in New York for a felony offense, and that he was a second felony offender as defined by &sect; 70.06(1)(a) because he was convicted of a felony defined in N.Y. Penal Law. ch. 70 after he was subject to the predicate felony conviction. The court rejected defendant's argument that the imposition of a harsher sentence on a defendant who was first convicted of a felony outside of the New York Penal Law and later convicted of a felony as defined by the Law, but not where the convictions occurred in the reverse order, violated equal protection. The court explained that the classification was rational because the legislature could reasonably have concluded that the nature of the felonies defined in the Law warranted harsher sentences for those convicted of felonies defined in the Law who had also previously been convicted of any felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In September 1981, the special term reduced the tax assessments for first and second petitioners. In 1982, it estopped the Board from challenging the validity of the state rates for specific years, holding that third petitioner was entitled to use the state rates for those years. In October 1981, however, the 1979 amendment to N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 720(3) expired. The law as re-enacted in December 1981 contained a new N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 720(3), which again barred the introduction of the state rates in Nassau County and New York City as evidence of inequality in tax assessment review proceedings The primary issue to be resolved was whether it was proper to allow petitioners, who were challenging assessments on the ground of inequality, to establish a ratio of assessed valuation to fair market value by means of the state equalization rates. The court held that it was proper, but only in the first two judgments, which were affirmed. The court reversed and remitted the third proceeding, finding that the new statute was not to be applied retroactively, and that the third proceeding had not progressed to the appropriate stage before the new provision was enacted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment debtors filed an action against the creditors, claiming that the funds in their checking accounts were statutorily exempt from restraint, execution, and levy. The complaint specifically alleged that N.Y. C.P.L.R. 5222 and 5232 violated the New York Constitution by authorizing the restraint and levy of personal property without providing the judgment debtor with notice of or an adequate opportunity to raise the claim of exemptions to the restraint or levy. The trial court dismissed the complaint against all the creditors. On appeal, the court noted that after the trial court's judgment, N.Y. C.P.L.R. 5222 and 5232 were amended. However, the court held that the appeal should not be dismissed on mootness considerations. The judgment debtors' claim for compensatory and punitive damages saved the action from the bar of mootness. The court further found that special damages could be awarded to the judgment debtors for the wrongful deprivation of their property. Finally, the court held that while some of the claims were properly dismissed, the judgment debtors were entitled to a new trial on the issue of damages with regard to the remaining claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant employer sought review of an order of respondent Workers' Compensation Board (New York) that determined that respondent claimant had sustained a 23 percent binaural schedule loss of hearing due to long-term exposure to noise injurious levels, and a subsequent order reaffirming the initial determination. On appeal, the employer challenged the board's adoption of regulations pertaining to occupational loss of hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer argued that the board exceeded its authority when it adopted the regulations on hearing loss applied to the instant claim because it failed to hold a public hearing, as required by N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 29. While generally such a hearing was required under &sect; 29 for labor law regulations, the court noted that N.Y. Work. Comp. Law &sect; 49-gg governed the adoption of regulations in the area of workers' compensation. As such, the procedural requirements of &sect; 49-gg were applicable to the board's hearing loss regulations. Moreover, &sect; 49-gg did not require a public hearing. The court also rejected the employer's argument that the board abused its discretion by not making an allowance for prescbycusis, hearing loss due to aging, in the regulations. Because hearing loss occurred at hertz levels that were much higher than the loss set forth in the regulations, there was no need to take a deduction for prescbycusis. Finally, the court rejected the employer's constitutional challenge to the regulations because the board stayed within its authority in adopting the regulations, and that there was a reasonable relationship between the regulations and the purpose of the legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the board's order finding that the claimant had suffered a compensable hearing loss, as well as the subsequent order reaffirming the initial decision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Workers' Compensation -- Occupational Loss of Hearing -- Adoption of Regulations Pertaining to Such Loss</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 49-gg of the Workers' Compensation Law, which outlines the procedural steps the Workers' Compensation Board must take in adopting regulations, supersedes section 29 of the Labor Law which requires the holding of a public hearing before any rule is adopted, amended or repealed. Accordingly, since section 49-gg does not provide for a hearing, it is reasonable to assume that the Legislature did not intend one and, therefore, the board did not err in failing to hold hearings prior to adopting regulations pertaining to standards for determining when a worker has suffered an occupational&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  loss of hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Workers' Compensation -- Occupational Loss of Hearing -- Presbycusis Deduction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Workers' Compensation Board did not abuse its discretion in failing to provide a deduction for presbycusis, hearing loss due to aging, in regulations it adopted pertaining to standards for determining when a worker has suffered an occupational loss of hearing; there is a rational basis for the board's determination, since hearing loss from repeated exposure to excessively loud noise usually occurs in the 4,000 hertz area thus obviating the need for such deduction if frequencies below the 4,000 hertz level were adopted.  Moreover, section 49-gg of the Workers' Compensation Law does not mandate that a deduction for presbycusis be factored into the board's formula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Workers' Compensation -- Occupational Loss of Hearing -- Adoption of Regulations by Special Committee -- Limitation of Size of Committee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The special committee which drafted regulations regarding occupational loss of hearing was not enlarged beyond the limit imposed by section 49-gg of the Workers' Compensation Law through consultation with additional experts; such consultation was consistent with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the explicit statutory direction to &quot;meet and confer with representatives of the workers' compensation board and with representatives of employers and employees&quot;; moreover, the filed regulatory impact statement named only six members of the committee, a number well within the statutory limit. In addition, the regulations were supported by a majority of the committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Workers' Compensation -- Occupational Loss of Hearing -- Constitutionality of Regulations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Workers' Compensation Board did not violate the New York State Constitution in adopting regulations pertaining to occupational loss of hearing on the grounds that it exceeded its delegated authority conferred by section 49-gg of the Workers' Compensation Law and that it adopted regulations contrary to the prevailing medical authority; the board stayed within its delegated authority in adopting the regulations and there is a reasonable relationship between the regulations and the intended purpose of the legislation.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ordinance prohibited trucks from using the shortest route between an industrial area and an expressway. Plaintiff, whose members owned businesses that relied upon the use of the prohibited portion of the road, alleged that the ordinance was not reasonably related to defendant town's police powers. Plaintiff also alleged that the extra expense involved in using the alternate route together with the resulting decrease in the value of industrial property constituted a taking without compensation. At trial, plaintiff's expert attributed importance to the road as a &quot;connector&quot; highway; he also testified that the new, alternate route to be taken as a result of the ordinance passed through residential areas, as well as a dangerous intersection. The town offered no evidence. The special term declared the ordinance to be constitutional, but the court reversed on appeal. The court found that the ordinance bore no real or substantial relationship to the public welfare.

Ordinance No. 83-162, authorizing refunds to nonprotesting taxpayers, was a constitutional exercise of the city's authority under N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect; 20(5).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In their class action, the protesters obtained a ruling that nonprotesters had no legal right to recover their payments of an unconstitutionally levied real property tax. The city responded by enacting Ordinance No. 83-162, authorizing equitable repayment of the taxes to the nonprotesters. On remittitur, the supreme court ruled that the ordinance was constitutional, and the protesters appealed. The court affirmed. The constitutional prohibition against gifts and loans, N.Y. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, was no impediment to the ordinance because N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect; 20(5) permitted municipalities to pay equitable claims. When the only impediment to legal liability lay in a technical defect which barred an otherwise valid claim, a recognizable moral and equitable obligation arose on which the city could act. The ordinance did not violate &sect; 20(5)'s prohibition against waiver of the defense of the statute of limitations because the nonprotesting taxpayers never had legal claims which could have been subject to a limitations period and any action on their part could have been treated as a plenary action for money had and received, in which the applicable limitations period was six years.</SPAN></P>

When the only impediment to legal liability lies in a technical defect which bars an otherwise valid claim, a recognizable moral and equitable obligation arises on which the city may act; accordingly, since the subject ordinance does nothing more than recognize the claims of the nonprotesters as equitable claims and provide that any compromise with nonprotesters be limited&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the amount available in the city's special fund for tax refunds, it is a proper exercise of the legislative function by the city council; nothing in the ordinance affects the legal claims of the protesters against the city which have been established earlier.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, a challenge to a tax statute alleged to be unconstitutional may be treated as a plenary action for money had and received for which the applicable limitations period is six years; inasmuch as the first illegal tax assessment was made on July 1, 1974, and the counterclaim of the nonprotesting taxpayers was interposed on June 26, 1980, the action would have been timely&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  commenced.  </SPAN></P>

On appeal, the Commission asserted that alimony payments were purely personal in nature, were not related to income producing activities in New York, and were nondeductible. The court found that there was no substantial reason for the disparate treatment between residents and nonresidents. The court noted that no governmental policy explaining the disparity in treatment accorded nonresidents existed, and there was no showing that the factor of residence had a legitimate connection with allowing the deduction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the father and the mother were divorced, the mother retained custody of the child. The father was convicted for arson in the third degree and sentenced to a term of 7 1/2 to 15 years in a state prison. The mother's new husband petitioned to adopt the child. The trial court approved the adoption without the father's consent. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that there was no constitutional infirmity in the provisions of N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 111(2)(d) and N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 79(1), which combined to eliminate the need for the consent of a natural parent to the adoption of his or her child where the natural parent had received a sentence of imprisonment for any term less than for life. The statutory scheme constituted a valid exercise of the state's power to act in the child's best interest. There was clear and convincing evidence to support the finding that the best interest of the child would be served by permitting adoption by the mother's husband without the consent of the father.

Although the subject child was born in wedlock, the family relationship was fleeting at best and there is no substantive due process violation; the statutory scheme does not create an unconstitutional irrebuttable presumption of unfitness since the court is merely given the power to approve an adoption without the natural parent's consent and whether the court will exercise this power depends upon the best interests of the child.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent, Budget Director of the State of New York, appealed a judgment in favor of petitioner state employees by the Supreme Court of Rensselaer County (New York), which declared Budget Bulletin D-1052 null and void and the &quot;98 percent rule&quot; set forth therein unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state employees argued that Budget Bulletin D-1052 violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 because it authorized the budget director to withhold an eight percent salary increase where their salaries were either 98 percent of their supervisors' salaries, or they were &quot;exempt&quot; employees. The trial court found the regulation to be arbitrary and capricious. The budget director appealed. The court modified the trial court's judgment to declare that Budget Bulletin D-1052 was not unconstitutional. The court concluded that sufficient standards were set forth such that the delegation of legislative authority to the budget director was in all respects constitutional. The court determined that salary compression was a valid state objective, which did not violate the policy of equal pay for equal work set forth in N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 115. The withholding of the salary increase for only the highest paid management or exempt employees was rational and not arbitrary and capricious. Thus, the budget director's withholding of salary increases did not violate the state employees rights to equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Chapter 460 (&sect; 7, subd 10) of the Laws of 1982, which provides that, notwithstanding an 8% salary increase for positions designated management/confidential by the Civil Service Law, any increase may be withheld in whole or in part from any officer or employee when in the opinion of the Director of the Budget such increase is not warranted or is not appropriate, is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority; there is no constitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  prohibition against the delegation of power, with reasonable safeguards and standards, to an agency or commission to administer the law as enacted by the Legislature, and the words &quot;warranted&quot; and &quot;appropriate&quot; set forth a constitutionally permissible standard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- Compensation and Benefits -- Withholding of Salary Increase from Certain Employees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The 98% rule set forth in a budget bulletin directing that certain upper-level management/confidential State employees receive a scheduled salary increase only to the extent that their salaries would not be greater than 98% of their supervisor's salary was not arbitrary and capricious, nor was it violative of the equal protection clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions; such salary compression, which has been implemented in previous years, is a legitimate State objective, and there was thus a legitimate State purpose behind the enactment of chapter 460 (&sect; 7, subd 10) of the Laws of 1982, pursuant to which the subject bulletin was implemented, providing that notwithstanding an 8% salary increase for management/confidential positions, any increase could be withheld when in the opinion of the Budget Director&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such increase is not warranted or is not appropriate.  Although the 98% rule was applicable to only a small group of employees and others received the increase, the two groups were not similarly situated, and the statute authorizes the withholding of salary increases under the 98% rule from &quot;any&quot; officer or employee, which means &quot;all&quot; or &quot;every&quot; and imports no limitation; in matters involving the State budget, equal protection does not require that all classifications be made with mathematical precision, nor does the principle of equal pay for equal work mandate that such principle must be applied in all cases under any and all conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- Compensation and Benefits -- Withholding of Salary Increase from Certain Employees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A budget bulletin directing that all &quot;exempt&quot; employees in positions designated as management/confidential and earning more than $ 23,065 annually would not receive any of a scheduled salary increase, was in accordance with chapter 460 (&sect; 7, subd 10) of the Laws of 1982, which provides that notwithstanding an 8% salary increase for management/confidential positions, any increase may be withheld in whole or in part from any officer or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  employee when in the opinion of the Director of the Budget, such increase is not warranted or is not appropriate; in promulgating the budget bulletin, the Budget Director did not abdicate any responsibility that the Legislature had delegated to him, and the withholding of salary increases from exempt employees did not violate their rights to equal protection. The Budget Director's decision to withhold the salary increases from upper-level exempt employees, as part of a series of stringent measures relative to the State's work force, had a rational basis directly related to a State objective, and such decision cannot be condemned merely because it did not produce the budgetary savings originally expected.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) and mistakenly charged with a misdemeanor. His counsel sent a note to the traffic court that said defendant would plead guilty to the offense. It was discovered that defendant should have been charged with a felony because of a prior DWI conviction in the last 10 years. Defendant pled guilty to the felony and was sentenced to probation. Defendant appealed the conviction, and the court affirmed. The court held that N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1192(5) did not create an unlawful bill of attainder because it enhanced a misdemeanor DWI to a felony based on a conviction for DWI within the previous 10 years. The potential pool of DWI misdemeanants was unlimited, and the statute did not impermissibly focus on an identifiable group but set forth a rule of general applicability. Both the initial misdemeanor and the subsequent felony conviction were predicated upon a judicial adjudication of guilt based on an objective legal standard.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 5 of section 1192 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law is not an unconstitutional bill of attainder on the ground that it enhances a misdemeanor driving while intoxicated (D.W.I.) penalty to a felony upon a second conviction within 10 years without judicial process, other than proof of the previous conviction, only to those individuals who are prior D.W.I. misdemeanants; the potential pool of D.W.I. misdemeanants and, therefore, potential D.W.I. recidivists, is unlimited; accordingly, the statute does not impermissibly focus on an identifiable group but, rather, sets forth a rule of general applicability; the judicial process involved is not insufficient to support a felony conviction since both the initial misdemeanor and the subsequent felony convictions are predicated upon a judicial adjudication of guilt based on an objective&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  legal standard.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's felony conviction, upon a guilty plea, of driving while intoxicated resulting from a prior misdemeanor conviction for the same offense, is not unconstitutional on the ground that the procedural due process attending misdemeanor trials that result in conviction is insufficient to render a recidivist a felon; since defendant does not contend that he was unrepresented by counsel during his prior misdemeanor conviction, said conviction may constitutionally serve as a predicate for the subsequent felony conviction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A letter from defense counsel, enclosing a signed traffic information and stating that defendant pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of driving while intoxicated, sent to a Town Justice, is not equivalent to an accepted plea of guilty; a guilty plea to a misdemeanor can only be made in person or, with permission of the court, by counsel after filing of the defendant's written subscribed authorization; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  accordingly, defendant's attempted plea by mail was a nullity and, therefore, jeopardy did not attach prior to the subsequent Grand Jury indictment of defendant for driving while intoxicated and defendant's guilty plea thereto, so as to render said indictment and plea violations of the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff apartment building and defendant sewer authority each sought review of an order from the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), which, in the building's action challenging the ad valorem portion of the authority's sewer rent charge, denied the building's request for a stay of any foreclosure action against the lien of the building's unpaid sewer rents, and denied the authority's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The building received a notice from the authority that the building was in default for failure to pay the ad valorem portion of the sewer rent charge assessed by the authority, and that a lien had been placed on the property. The building filed an action challenging the authority's ability to charge the ad valorem assessment. The authority filed a motion for summary judgment, and the building filed a motion to stay any foreclosure proceedings instituted by the authority in collection of the lien. The trial court denied both motions and both parties sought review. The court found that the laws granting the authority the ability to charge the ad valorem assessment were not unconstitutional, that the building's claims were insufficient to support its claims of civil rights violations, that the authority's imposition of sewer rent charges on any basis other than those provided for in the law was unlawful, and that the authority's method for determining sewer rents was also unlawful.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Computation of sewer rents by defendant sewer authority using assessed valuation of the serviced property as a component of the charge for sewer service does not constitute the imposition of an unauthorized tax.  Further, section 1180 of the Public Authorities Law, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as amended by section 1 of chapter 862 of the Laws of 1981, which provides that no ad valorem sewer rent be assessed against property exempt from real property taxes under specified sections of the Real Property Tax Law, and section 2 of chapter 862, which &quot;legalized, validated, ratified and confirmed&quot; the pre-existing practice of defendant &quot;in granting exemption from ad valorem sewer rents granted properties exempt from real property taxes&quot;, are constitutional.  However, defendant's practice of exempting certain tax-exempt properties from the assessed valuation component of its sewer rent, charging them only the component based on water consumption is unlawful, since the nonexempt users have paid a disproportionate share of the cost of rendering the service in violation of the mandate of section 1180 of the Public Authorities Law that sewer rents &quot;be collected from all real property&quot; on an &quot;equitable basis&quot;; should defendant persist in using the ad valorem component as a basis of its charges against nonexempt users, some other factor must be introduced into its methodology in relation to real property exempted under section 1180 in order to provide the equality required by said statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Allegations by plaintiff real property owner that defendant sewer authority granted ad valorem sewer rental exemptions to certain taxpayers and that defendant notified plaintiff's mortgagee that plaintiff's sewer rents were in default do not state causes of action for deprivation of civil rights under section 1983 of title 42 of the United States Code; plaintiff, which has never paid the challenged portion of the sewer rent, has never been deprived of any rights, privileges or immunities, and its claim that other entities have been granted exemptions to which they are not entitled is insufficient to establish a cause of action under section 1983, which was designed to provide a Federal remedy in cases where the State remedy is inadequate.  Moreover, even if defendant's notice to plaintiff's mortgagee that sewer rents were unpaid were found to be a violation of plaintiff's rights, punitive damages could not be awarded, as defendant is a public authority and the reasons which foreclose imposition of punitive damages upon municipalities apply equally to it.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled in favor of the board. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The court found that the language of the statue requiring all real property to be assessed at a uniform percentage of value referred to the market value of the property. The court further stated that &sect; 305 did not violate the equal protection clause because taxing jurisdictions were not bound to assess property at 100 percent of its full value. So long as all real property was assessed at a uniform percentage value, as was required by the statute, there was no infringement of equal protection. The court found that fractional assessments declared invalid in a previous case were not so declared invalid on constitutional grounds but upon another section of the real property law that had since been repealed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, Board of Education of Dundee Central School District, Board of Regents of the State of New York, and Commissioner of Education of the State of New York, sought to overturn the summary judgment entered by the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), which held that N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 8, &sect; 156.3(b) was invalid and that respondent bus driver should not have been terminated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 156.3(b) provided that bus drivers were not permitted to continue driving buses once they reached 65 years of age, and when the bus driver reached age 65 he was terminated. The lower court held that &sect; Section 156.3(b) violated the State and Federal Constitutions and that it violated N.Y. Retire. &amp; Soc. Sec. Law &sect; 501(15). The court affirmed that portion of the lower court's order that held that N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 8, &sect; 156.3(b) was inconsistent with N.Y. Retire. &amp; Soc. Sec. Law &sect; 501(15) and thus invalid. Section 501(15) provided that the mandatory retirement age was 70 for all public employees except police or fire members, and N.Y. Retire. &amp; Soc. Sec. Law &sect; 500(a) provided that if there was a conflict between N.Y. Retire. &amp; Soc. Sec. Law &sect; 501(15) and another provision, then &sect; 501(15) was controlling. Thus, the discharge of the bus driver at age 65 was improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant state sought review of an order and judgment of the Supreme Court, Suffolk County (New York), that dismissed its petition brought pursuant to N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State commenced an investigation of various acts and practices of the lessor pertaining to a fuel surcharge to tenants. The lessor commenced suit against the State seeking a declaration that the lease was legal and proper under state law and an injunction enjoining the State from interference with the lessor in the conduct of its business. The State moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action and to join the tenants as necessary parties. The State brought an action under N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 63(12). The cases were consolidated and the special term declared the lease legal and binding. The State appealed. The appellate court held that a declaratory judgment was meaningless absent the participation of the tenants and should be dismissed. The court held that the proceedings by the lessor were brought in improper format and that the State had authority under &sect; 63(12). The court ruled a hearing was required because the record indicated the possible existence of both the procedural and substantive elements of unconscionability and to determine the appropriateness of the surcharge.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action by plaintiff landlord against the Attorney-General seeking a declaration that plaintiff's leases are legal and proper and to enjoin defendant from interfering with plaintiff in the conduct of his business and from conducting an official investigation of plaintiff and his business, a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action and for failure to join the tenants as necessary parties, made after service of an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  answer, was not untimely; a motion for dismissal based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction, failure to state a cause of action, or the absence of a person who should be a party, may be brought at any time even if such objection is not raised in the answer ( CPLR 3211, subd [e]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Matters Reviewable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An action by a landlord against the State seeking a declaration that the landlord's leases are legal and proper and to enjoin the Attorney-General from interfering with the landlord in the conduct of his business and a special proceeding brought subsequently by the State against the landlord to enjoin the landlord from engaging in conduct violative of subdivision 12 of section 63 of the Executive Law were consolidated in an order and judgment which also dismissed certain causes of action in the Attorney-General's petition and declared that the leases were legal and binding, after the Attorney-General's motion to dismiss the action brought by the landlord was denied; the propriety of the landlord's action against the State is properly before the Appellate Division although no appeal was taken from the denial of the motion to dismiss, since the paper appealed from, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the order and final judgment, brought up for review the order denying said motion; an appeal from a final judgment brings up for review any nonfinal judgment or order necessarily affecting the final judgment ( CPLR 5501, subd [a]), and denial of the motion to dismiss the complaint certainly affected the final judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Necessary Parties</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. An action by a landlord against the State seeking a declaration that his leases are legal and proper is dismissed; the tenants who are parties to agreements with the landlord utilizing the leases at issue are necessary parties ( CPLR 1001, subd [a]), and although a declaratory judgment would be binding on the State and the Attorney-General, the right of any tenant in a judicial proceeding to claim that some portion of the lease was illegal would not be affected, since the tenant would not have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Injunctions -- When Remedy Appropriate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. An action by a landlord to enjoin the Attorney-General from interfering in the conduct of his business and from investigating the landlord and his business, is dismissed; the landlord was seeking relief with respect to his own&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  case only and thus should have brought an individual CPLR article 78 proceeding.  Furthermore, courts do not review, by way of an action for an injunction, the exercise of discretion by public officials in the enforcement of State statutes in the absence of a clear violation of some constitutional mandate; the basis for the investigation was subdivision 12 of section 63 of the Executive Law, which empowers the Attorney-General to investigate repeated fraudulent or illegal acts or persistent fraud or illegality in the carrying on of business, and there was no claim of unconstitutionality; an accusation of harassment is insufficient to serve as a basis for enjoining the Attorney-General from attempting to enforce such a legislative mandate.  Additionally, the action is merely a disguised writ of prohibition, which should also have been brought within a CPLR article 78 proceeding; however, so long as the Attorney-General's role was solely investigative, it was &quot;executive&quot; in nature and could not be the subject of a writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Attorney-General has standing to bring a special proceeding containing a cause of action seeking to enjoin respondent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  landlord from attempting to obtain an unauthorized fuel surcharge from tenants, pursuant to subdivision 12 of section 63 of the Executive Law which requires a showing of repeated fraudulent or illegal acts or persistent fraud or illegality in the conducting of business; although the proceeding was instituted prior to the effective date of the 1981 amendment to the statute, which authorizes a proceeding when the respondent is guilty of only one act of alleged misconduct if it affects more than one person, and which is inapplicable because its effect would be to reverse a determination of the Supreme Court dismissing the fuel surcharge cause of action, respondent's actions are properly considered a repeated or persistent act within the meaning of the statute.  The Attorney-General not only has standing to challenge the fuel surcharge on the ground of alleged fraud, but has also made a threshold demonstration that, upon satisfactory proof, he will be entitled to relief with respect to the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Lease -- Unconscionability of Terms -- Challenge by Attorney-General</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Causes of action questioning certain lease provisions on grounds of unconscionability&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are subject to challenge in a proceeding brought by the Attorney-General pursuant to subdivision 12 of section 63 of the Executive Law, which provides that when a person engages in persistent fraud or illegality in the carrying on of business the Attorney-General may apply for an injunction; unconscionability requires some showing of an absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms which are unreasonably favorable to the other party and where the record indicates the possible existence of both procedural and substantive elements of unconscionability, a hearing is required.  The fact that a lease is not negotiable and that a tenant cannot bargain over its individual terms alone warrants a hearing to afford the parties the opportunity of demonstrating the existence or lack of meaningful choice on the part of the tenants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The State of New York, through the offices of the Attorney-General, has standing to challenge the security provisions in a form lease; as of July 1, 1973, the Attorney-General was specifically empowered to bring an action or proceeding to compel compliance with the laws concerning tenants' &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  security deposits (General Obligations Law, &sect; 7-107), and the fact that a petition fails to cite the statute giving standing is, at most, a defect of form; a proceeding to enjoin respondent landlord from engaging in conduct violative of subdivision 12 of section 63 of the Executive Law, insofar as it challenges a portion of the clause in the leases relating to interest on security deposits, should be deemed amended and brought under section 7-107 of the General Obligations Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Security Deposits</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. A lease provision that a tenant's security deposit will be placed in an interest-bearing account and that the interest, less 1% service charge, will be paid to the tenant after expiration of the lease, is void as violative of section 7-103 of the General Obligations Law, which gives the tenant the option of having the landlord either hold the interest in trust for him until the expiration of the lease, apply it for the use or rental of the premises, or remit it to the tenant on an annual basis.  Absent a violation of the lease justifying application of the security and interest to any deficit in the rent due, the tenant should be given a choice of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  alternatives; signing the lease, absent language in that document informing the tenant of those alternatives required by section 7-103 cannot be taken as a selection thereof; new and renewed leases should not contain the violative language, but should include a provision allowing the tenant the statutorily mandated options.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant admittedly burglarized a private home in midday, gaining entry by breaking a window in the back door and unlocking it. On appeal, defendant argued that an amendment to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 140.25(2) classifying a daytime burglary of a dwelling as punishable as a class C violent felony, was unconstitutional. Upon review, the court found defendant's argument without merit. Absent a showing that, when it amended &sect; 140.25(2), the New York Legislature was not acting in pursuit of permissible State objectives and that the means adopted by it were not reasonably related to the accomplishment of those objectives, the court would not substitute its judgment for that of the Legislature. The reclassifying the crime of burglarizing a dwelling during the day from a class D felony to a class C felony, with the concomitant increase in penalty, did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. When compared with sentences imposed for other crimes within the State and punishments imposed for the same or similar crimes in other jurisdictions, the sentence was not grossly disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

The court, in confirming the Commission's determination, found that the partners did not carry their burden, under N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 689(e), to overturn the deficiency assessment. In addition, the court found that, under N.Y. Comp.

The inmate argued on appeal that &sect; 130 was unconstitutional in that it erected an absolute bar to the appointment of felons to the office of notary public and utilized an irrational criterion, i.e., a prior felony conviction, for an assessment of fitness. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that when the conditional disqualification set forth in &sect; 130 was read in conjunction with the standards governing the issuance of a certificate of good conduct, the statutory scheme did not work an irrational or permanent bar to a convicted felon seeking appointment as a notary public. The court further found that the criteria in &sect; 130 were entirely rational in view of the responsibilities attendant the office of notary public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim, defendant's former employer, testified that defendant illegally entered the victim's home, pointed a rifle at the victim, demanded money from the victim, and struck the victim with the rifle barrel. Defendant testified that he was at work and then later at a bar when the alleged crimes occurred. There was evidence corroborating both the victim's and defendant's version of the facts. On appeal, the court held that defendant's acquittal of robbery did not preclude defendant's conviction for burglary because there was sufficient evidence of defendant's larcenous intent. The court affirmed defendant's conviction for criminal trespass because criminal trespass in the first degree as defined in N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 140.17(1) was not a lesser included offense of burglary in the first degree as defined in N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 140.30(1). The court determined that the trial court's assessment of fines under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 60.35 constituted an unconstitutional ex post facto application of &sect; 60.35 because the acts for which defendant was convicted occurred before the revenue raising measures of &sect; 60.35 took effect.</SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding seeking a declaration that the new legislation was unconstitutional on various grounds and an injunction against enforcement of the legislation declared unconstitutional. The state presented a motion to dismiss the petition. The lower court granted the union's motion for a preliminary injunction. The state filed a notice of appeal, statutorily staying the preliminary injunction under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 5519(a)(1). The court reversed. The court held that without a preliminary injunction, no irreparable harm would have been done to the union in the event that the union was correct on the merits of its challenge to the statute, but substantial harm would have been done to the state if the union was incorrect on the merits.

Defendant received the statutory minimum sentence of two consecutive terms of two years to six years each. Defendant sought review on the ground that the imposition of the mandated sentence of imprisonment, under the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offense and in view of defendant's character and background, constituted an unconstitutional application of New York's penal statutes in violation of the cruel and unusual punishment clauses of the United States and New York Constitutions, U.S. Const. amend. VIII, N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 5. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that its discretionary power to modify sentences did not permit the reduction of a sentence below the minimum allowed by law. The court found that defendant's sentence was not cruel and unusual because it was not irrational to require some minimum prison sentence for a violent category of serious life-endangering offenses.</SPAN></P>

The court accepted the plea in full satisfaction of a six-count indictment. Defendant pleaded guilty to an unrelated count of third degree grand larceny in another court. Defendant was sentenced to a term of two to four years on the forgery conviction; this sentence was made to run consecutively to the larceny sentence. On review, defendant maintained that a sentence of probation would have been more appropriate. The court disagreed but sent the case back in the interests of justice for a hearing to ascertain the actual terms of the forgery plea bargain. According to the court, the record of the proceedings did not, by itself, establish that the district attorney was under any obligation to recommend that defendant's sentences run concurrently. Accordingly, the court withheld its decision and ordered the matter remitted to the trial court that produced the forgery conviction for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

As a result of the investigation, the grand jury issued a report that was required by law to remain sealed for 31 days following its disclosure to the person named therein. Prior to the expiration of the 31-day period, the reporter obtained information on the contents of the sealed report and broadcast such information as part of a news report. The prosecutor issued a subpoena to the reporter commanding his appearance before the grand jury to investigate the identity of the reporter's source given the fact that there was a likelihood that the source had committed a felony by divulging the contents of the report. The reporter filed a motion to quash the subpoena on the grounds that he was privileged not to reveal the identity of his source. The trial court granted the motion, and the court reversed. The court held that neither the First Amendment nor the New York Shield Law, N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 79-h, protected the reporter from making his news sources known to a grand jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the time of the child's birth, the natural mother placed the child with the custodial parents, but retained custody, control, earnings and support of the child. Three weeks later, the natural mother began to demand the return of her infant, leading to her petitioner to regain custody. The court held that there was no basis for the state to intervene in the natural mother's right to custody of her child because there was no showing of surrender, abandonment, unfitness, persistent neglect, unfortunate or involuntary extended disruption of custody, or other extraordinary circumstances. The mother was dedicated to the struggle to regain her child, and the delay in returning the child to her was largely caused by protracted court proceedings. The period of separation was entitled to little, if any, consideration because it was due to the custodians' efforts to gain custody. The natural mother's poverty did not disqualify her from successful parenting. There were no extraordinary circumstances that would drastically affect the welfare of the child that required court intervention in the mother's right to custody.</SPAN></P>

The town enacted an ordiance restricting peddling on the public highways. The florist commenced a declaratory judgment action to challenge the constitutionality of the ordinance.

On review, the court affirmed and found that the florist was adversely affected by the ordinance and this gave him him standing to challenge its validity.The florist maintained that the effect of the requirement that he keep moving at all times except when actually effecting a sale to a customer was so restrictive as to make the conduct of peddling virtually impossible. The court held that irrespective of whether the florist's contentions were valid, it was apparent that the ordinance was so severely restrictive that it would unquestionably have a deleterious effect on his business. The town did not advance any rationale to support the proposition that such a severe degree of restriction was reasonably related to improving traffic safety and aesthetics within the town.

Plaintiff's two subsequent pregnancies and her series of annual gynecological examinations did not constitute a continuous course of treatment sufficient to postpone the running&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Statute of Limitations, since the &quot;continuous treatment&quot; exception is limited to a continuous course of treatment related to the same original condition or complaint, for the same or related illness or injuries, continuing after the alleged acts of malpractice, and excludes cases involving the mere continuity of a general physician-patient relationship.  Plaintiff's contention that the defendant doctor is estopped from raising the Statute of Limitations as a bar to her action because he knowingly concealed his malpractice from her and intentionally deceived her in order to prevent her from suing him is without basis; there is no allegation that he actually knowingly concealed his malpractice or made fraudulent misrepresentations to plaintiff and the allegations do not in any way indicate the kind of actual fraud necessary to create an equitable estoppel.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant city department of finance (department) sought review of the judgment of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which directed, with respect to contraband seized from appellee cigarette distributor (distributor), that the property be turned over to a prosecutor for criminal proceedings, or that a forfeiture proceeding be instituted, or that the property be returned to the distributor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The distributor was a wholesale distributor of cigarettes, authorized as a meter agent by the city and state to affix tax stamps to cigarettes purchased and imported from out-of-state manufacturers. The department's investigators searched the distributor's premises and seized cartons of cigarettes bearing counterfeit tax stamps. Pursuant to a warrant, the department subsequently seized stamping machinery and the remaining stock of taxed and untaxed cigarettes. Notices of levy and sale were issued on the dates of the seizures in accordance with N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 477. The court below found that the seizure was unconstitutional because neither the per se contraband items nor the ancillary property alleged to be merely an instrumentality of the crime could be seized under &sect; 477, because &sect; 477 failed to grant a prompt hearing on the seizure. The judgment of the court below, which provided the department with three alternative with respect to the per se contraband was reversed on appeal because the distributor's failure to pay or bond the tax as a precondition to judicial review of the department's actions was fatal.

The requirement of the Administrative Code of the City of New York that petitioner, a wholesale distributor of cigarettes, deposit the amount of tax at issue or an undertaking as a condition precedent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to judicial review of the seizure by respondent of cigarettes, some of which were untaxed and some of which bore counterfeit tax stamps, is constitutional; a taxing authority has the constitutional right to require a taxpayer to secure an assessment by payment or bond before litigating that liability; moreover, the warrantless search of petitioner's premises which resulted in discovery of the contraband appears to have been consensual and to have been conducted pursuant to a constitutionally approved procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Cigarette Tax -- Seizure of Untaxed Cigarettes -- Hearing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section D46-11.0 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York which gives a taxpayer the right, within 30 days of notice of the fixing of the tax, to request a hearing on the determination is constitutional; the fact that no time limit is contained within the statute for the holding of such a hearing does not invalidate the statute on due process grounds; accordingly, where there was no unreasonable delay in holding a postseizure hearing and a prompt hearing was offered following respondent's seizure of a quantity of cigarettes from petitioner, some of which were untaxed and some of which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  bore counterfeit tax stamps, the statute cannot be declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Cigarette Tax -- Return of Contraband Cigarettes to Owner</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Counterfeit and unstamped cigarettes are per se contraband, possession of which constitutes a crime (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; D46-18.0, subd c); accordingly, it was improper for the court to order the return to petitioner of untaxed cigarettes and cigarettes bearing counterfeit tax stamps confiscated by respondent following their discovery pursuant to a consensual search of petitioner's premises; since mere possession of such contraband constitutes a crime, repossession of such per se contraband would subject the possessor to additional criminal penalties, and the return of such contraband would frustrate the express public policy against possession of such objects.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lower court granted summary judgment to the county and dismissed the victim's complaint because the county did not have prior notice of a defective road condition that caused the victim's injuries. On appeal, the victim contended that Tioga County, N.Y., Local Law No. 2 (1978) contravened the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, concluding that the law of the case did not bar the court's consideration of the victim's constitutional claims because there was no prior judicial resolution of such claims. The legislature was entitled to limit the right to sue a public entity for the negligent performance of a governmental function. The law conditioned a negligence action on the county's receipt of written notice of the dangerous condition. Local Law No. 2 was rationally related to the traveling public's protection and was not retroactively applied. Thus, there was no due process violation. Nor was there an equal protection violation because all victims were required to establish the county's receipt of notice to maintain an action against it.</SPAN></P>

The matter proceeded to compulsory arbitration, pursuant to N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 22, &sect; 28, and an arbitration award was entered in favor of the firm. The tortfeasor's counsel filed a demand for a trial de novo and a jury demand pursuant to N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 22, &sect; 28.12. Based on the demand for the trial de novo, respondent clerk refused to enter judgment on the arbitration award. The firm commenced the proceeding to compel the clerk to enter judgment in its favor on the award and to prohibit the clerk and judge from granting the demand for a trial de novo. The trial court treated the proceeding as an action for a judgment declaring &sect; 28.12 to be unconstitutional and dismissed the petition. It declared the rule constitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the firm failed to meet the burden necessary to rebut the presumption that &sect; 28.12 was constitutional. The compulsory arbitration system was enacted with the provision for a trial de novo and was constitutional because it did not eliminate a litigant's right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the sentence imposed on him by the trial court under the then-mandatory sentence should have been reduced because a new statute provided a lesser sentence for his offense.

Further, proof, although circumstantial, was sufficient to establish defendant's accessorial liability with respect to the drug-selling operation conducted by defendant's codefendant. Moreover, the court noted that the statute did much more than simply alter the punishment for the crime. It redefined the crime by increasing the weight of the narcotic drug sold necessary to constitute the sale an A-I felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer allocated 100 percent of its business income to the city, for the purposes of the general corporation tax. To avoid an allocation of 100 percent on its investment income, which was derived from governmental obligations, the taxpayer bought stock in a private corporation. Although the private stock equaled less than one percent of the taxpayer's investment assets, it reduced its investment income allocation from 100 percent to two percent. Respondent department assessed a deficiency against the taxpayer, pursuant to N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. &sect; R46-4.0(8), and the taxpayer brought a N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding against the department to contest the determination. The court held that: (1) if the investment allocation percentage did not properly reflect the taxpayer's assets and income, the department was authorized to adjust the percentage by the exclusion of one or more assets in computing the percentage, provided that the income therefrom was also excluded in determining net income; and (2) the statute was not an unlawful delegation of legislative power, under N.Y.

Const. art. IX, &sect; 2(c)(ii)(8). The taxpayers appealed from the denial of class certification and a tax refund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Local Law No. 29 required owners of real property valued over a certain amount to pay property taxes semi-annually, while allowing taxes on other properties to be paid quarterly. The taxpayers filed a declaratory judgment action against the city challenging the constitutionality of Local Law No. 29, and the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted the taxpayers' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court, ruling that Local Law No. 29 was constitutional, finding that as long as tax assessments were uniform, the manner of collection could have been varied. The court ruled that Local Law No. 29 created different collection classifications but did not affect assessment categories specified in N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 1802. The court found no conflict between the two laws, and, thus, Local Law No. 29 did not violate N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2 (c)(ii)(8). Also, Local Law No. 29 did not deny equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment because there was a rational basis for the collection classifications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city adopted a resolution limiting the veterans' real property exemption, granted pursuant to N.Y. Real Prop.

The trial court denied the city's motion for summary judgment dismissing the action and, instead, granted the veteran's motion for class action status. The city appealed and the court reversed. The court initially noted that there was a strong presumption in favor of the resolution's validity and that it could strike the resolution down only when unconstitutionality was shown beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found, however, that the resolution simply brought the city's tax collections from property owning veterans into conformity with &sect; 458 since it limited the veterans' exemption to non-school taxes. The court observed that the fact that the city previously allowed a general veterans' exemption did not estop it from discontinuing such an extralegal or permissive practice. Finally, the court determined that the city was not required to hold a public hearing on the resolution and that its adoption did not violate N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 20(3), (5).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Westchester County Surrogate's Court (New York) held that respondent Department of Social Services (DSS) could recover the money it spent for nonmedical care of the children, who were removed from their parents and from the father's estate under N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect;&sect; 101, 104. The lower court ordered the DSS to reimburse Social Security benefits, which the DSS used for support, to the children. Petitioner administratrix and the DSS appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The DSS filed a claim against the father's estate for reimbursement of care and assistance that were given to the children, and the administratrix rejected the claim. On appeal, the court held that the father, who had the means to fully pay, had a duty to support his children. The DSS was a fiduciary with respect to the Social Security benefits, and it breached its duty by expending them on nonmedical care of the children rather than utilizing public funds and seeking recoupment from the father. The lower court had jurisdiction to determine the propriety of the expenditure of the funds because (1) the federal courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction; (2) the DSS was liable to the children for an equitable accounting under state law; and (3) the lower court had authority to direct the DSS to repay the funds to the children, who were domiciled in his county. The lower court should have declined to order the DSS to repay the funds in the intermediate accounting proceeding. N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect;&sect; 101, 104 authorized the DSS to recover from the estate the costs of medical assistance for the children with predecision interest from each separate expenditure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the holding that the DSS owed the children reimbursement for Social Security benefits, which it spent for support of the children, but reversed the order for reimbursement in an intermediate accounting proceeding without prejudice to a new claim by the DSS or the children before the final accounting.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Social Security benefits paid to the Department of Social Services as representative payee of two neglected infants in the care of the department were unnecessarily and improperly utilized to cover the cost of the infants' care, where their father had the means to pay the full cost of the care without recourse to said benefits, which were payable to the children by reason of their mother's death; the department should have used public funds for the infants' support and sought reimbursement of the cost from their father (Social Services Law, &sect;&sect; 101, 104).  Further, in a proceeding to settle the intermediate account of the estate of the father, now deceased, the Surrogate had jurisdiction to determine the propriety of said expenditures by the department, which is liable to the infant beneficiaries as a fiduciary under the common law of New York, and the Surrogate had the right to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">sua sponte</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> direct the department to repay the moneys to the children, who were domiciled in his county and subject to the in personam jurisdiction of the court (SCPA 201, 1701, 1702).  However, the Surrogate should have declined to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  exercise that power, without prejudice to the rights of the department or the children to assert claims against the estate prior to the final accounting to recoup the expenses for support of the children during decedent's lifetime, as this would permit the recovery of predecision interest on the award.</SPAN></P>

A stipulation settling a proceeding commenced by the Department of Social Services against decedent father during his lifetime to recover for the support of his two neglected children is not a bar to recovery by the department, after his death, of amounts he could and should have paid in support, since the stipulation expressly provided that it was &quot;without prejudice&quot;.  Furthermore, since decedent gave no consideration for the stipulation of settlement, the estate would not be prejudiced by permitting the claim for the cost of care of the children; decedent had turned over bonds to the department which were the property of his children, having been registered in the name of their deceased mother as custodian of the children under the New York Uniform Gifts to Minors Act.</SPAN></P>

Sections 101 and 104 of the Social Services Law authorize the recovery from a responsible relative or his estate of medical assistance actually paid for children, regardless of whether the assistance was correctly or incorrectly paid (Social Services Law, &sect; 366, subd 3).  Accordingly, the Department of Social Services may recover from decedent father's estate the cost of medical assistance for his two neglected children in its care, which assistance was provided during the lifetime of their father, who was financially able to pay such expenses; further, each separate expenditure by the department for medical assistance should bear predecision interest at the legal rate from the date of payment ( CPLR 5001, subd [b]).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, a utility company and the public utility commission (commission), appealed a judgment from the Supreme Court, New York County (New York) that granted plaintiff consumer partial summary judgment on her claims that the utility violated the her constitutional due process rights when it denied her application for utility services and that the commission violated those rights when it failed to promulgate rules to safeguard her interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The consumer was a recipient of state public assistance benefits and applied to the utility company (utility) for services when she moved to a new home. The utility denied the application because she owed for services at her former address. The past due balance was the responsibility of her former landlord, but the utility did not inform her of any procedure through which to contest her liability. The consumer sued the utility and commission, alleging that it violated her state and federal constitutional due process rights and that the commission violated due process by not promulgating rules that would have required that first-time applicants such as she be afforded procedural due process safeguards before their applications could be denied. The trial court rendered judgment for the consumer. On appeal, the court ruled that the utility's conduct was private, and not state, action and thus the consumer had no cognizable action for a due process violation under either N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 or U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Likewise, the court ruled, the commission's failure to promulgate the rules urged by the consumer was an insufficient predicate to support a finding of state action.</SPAN></P>

The court found that by naming the school district as the trustee to receive, invest, administer, and dispense the scholarship funds, the bequest required substantial state involvement, thereby triggering the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Surrogate was correct in determining that it was appropriate to reform the trust because the decedent would have preferred the removal of the gender restriction to the failure of the trust. However, the court held that it would not give effect to a testamentary disposition designed to carry out some immoral or illegal purpose. The court held that presented with an invidiously discriminatory charitable trust which could not be constitutionally performed, the Surrogate was precluded by the Fourteenth Amendment from actively intervening to reform the trust in a way that had the &quot;immediate objective&quot; and &quot;ultimate effect&quot; of enforcing its discriminatory provision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was violated where, in a proceeding to construe the provisions of a will establishing a scholarship fund for the benefit of needy and deserving male high school graduates within a local school district and naming the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  school district as trustee, the Surrogate directed that a private trustee be substituted in place of the named trustee, which, as an agency of the State, is constitutionally prohibited from administering the invidiously discriminatory provisions of the trust; the decree was itself an unconstitutional exercise of State judicial power, since it directed reformation in order to give effect to the discriminatory objective of a trust which was constitutionally infirm as originally established.  The proper course is to delete the gender restriction, since it was at least as important to the testator that the school district carry out the task of selecting the scholarship recipients as it was to exclude women as objects of his bounty.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner mayor appealed the judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term, Albany County (New York), which dismissed the mayor's application, in a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. &sect; 78, to annul a determination of respondent State of New York Board of Equalization and Assessment (SBEA), which modified the penalty imposed upon respondent assessor to dismiss him from his position. The SBEA's modification called only a short suspension.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mayor had commenced disciplinary action to dismiss the assessor pursuant to N.Y. Real Prop.

The hearing officer recommended that the assessor be removed from office. The SBEA adopted the findings and recommendation of the hearing officer, but held that the penalty of dismissal be modified to a one month suspension. The mayor argued that the removal of the assessor was justified upon just cause as &sect; 1522(7) required. The court disagreed and affirmed the decision of the SBEA and the suspension, but annulled the portion of the SBEA determination that directed the city to reimburse the assessor for back pay. The court reasoned that the SBEA determination was reasonable and no evidence existed to establish that the decision was arbitrary or capricious. Since the SBEA's determination was not unreasonable, it was upheld.</SPAN></P>

Reversing the judgment of the lower court, the court held that the statute was constitutional because it did not grant an identifiable property right and the notice was sufficient to meet the requirement of notice under &sect; 197-c. The court held that procedural due process was designed to insure that there was no deprivation of rights otherwise created without notice and an opportunity to be heard. However, it was required only where it was designated to protect some liberty or property interest.

Further, the notice, published in English in the specified publications, and in conformity with the guidelines, met the statutory requirement, since English is the national language and it is appropriate that all notices required by law to be published, be published in that language.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The comptroller sought to compel the county executive to certify her vacant positions. She attacked the constitutionality of Erie County, N.Y., Administrative Code &sect; 3.09(e) and the power given the executive to block the filling of vacancies as an unlawful delegation of legislative power to the executive and a curtailment of the powers of elected officials contrary to the N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 23(2)(f). The trial court granted the executive's motion to dismiss the petition but decreed that she was entitled to attorney's fees in an amount to be determined after a hearing. Both parties appealed. The court affirmed because the executive was properly granted the oversight of expenditures of budgeted funds during the fiscal year as chief budget officer under the county charter. The action was converted by the court to a declaratory judgment action after the positions were filled. The power the legislature gave the executive was in harmony and consistent with the county charter and was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. Attorney's fees were proper for an office-holder who brought a good-faith action in an official capacity.</SPAN></P>

A proceeding by the Erie County Comptroller against respondent Erie County Executive and others challenging respondent's refusal to certify, pursuant to a provision of the Erie County Administrative Code, the necessity of filling certain vacancies in petitioner's office, was properly dismissed, since the duty of evaluating the need for a specific position and balancing that against the savings that would otherwise accrue if it remained unfilled for the balance of the year falls within the powers and responsibilities granted in the County Charter to the County Executive as chief executive officer, administrative head of the county government and chief budget officer, and the power the legislature has given the executive in said administrative code provision is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in harmony and consistent with the charter; furthermore, since the administrative code provision transfers from other branches to the executive no additional authority but merely sets forth the details, as directed by the County Charter, of how the executive shall function within the limits of the power already granted to him, said administrative code provision effected no abolition, curtailment or transfer of the powers of the comptroller or the legislators and no referendum was necessary to effect it (Municipal Home Rule Law, &sect; 23, subd 2, par f).</SPAN></P>

The corporation was assessed franchise tax deficiencies for taxes allegedly due under &sect; 184. The deficiencies were imposed as a result of various transactions in which the corporation was involved and which took place outside of New York. Thereafter, the corporation filed a petition requesting a redetermination or a refund. A hearing officer recommended granting the corporation's petition. However, the Commission sustained the deficiencies. The corporation sought review of the Commission's determination in a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding. The court held that there was nothing talismanic about the concept of &quot;commercial domicile&quot; that automatically rendered that concept applicable when taxation of income from intangibles was at issue. Section 184 taxed earnings from sources within New York and excluded earnings from interstate commerce. The disputed earnings were not from sources within New York and should not be taxed as they were derived from business of an interstate character.

The trial court declared the statute unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The Act prohibited states from taxing gross receipts from the sale of air transport services. The department contended that N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 184(1) was a franchise tax, which included gross receipts in its measurement, but was not entirely composed of gross receipts from the sale of air coverage and was, thus, permissible. According to the court, the plain terms of the Act directly prohibited the tax and did not allow for a construction, which permitted a tax wither directly or indirectly on gross receipts derived from air transportation. The court further noted that its conclusion was supported by the legislative history of the Act.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant church sought review of the decision from the Supreme Court, Westchester County (New York), which dismissed the church's action that alleged that a zoning ordinance was unconstitutional and that respondent zoning board erred in denying the church's application for a special use permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The church applied for a special use permit from the zoning board. The church stipulated that there would be no activities in violation of zoning ordinances prior to the hearing on the issue. At the hearing, the zoning board learned that the church did conduct activities in violation of the ordinances and had made other misrepresentations. The board denied the church's application. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that because the evidence presented at the zoning board's hearing on the church's special use permit did not show that the use the church sought would have a direct and immediate adverse effect upon the health, safety, or welfare of the community, the board's denial on that basis was improper. However, the court held that the church's misrepresentations prior to the hearing that it would abide by the current zoning ordinances was sufficient evidence that the church would not comply with the conditions imposed on its proposed use; thus, the board's denial on that ground was proper. The court ruled that the zoning board was not biased and that the zoning board had a right to complete its own investigation of the church's application.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Special Use Permit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A zoning board's denial of an application for a special use permit for the operation by the Unification Church of a training and recruitment center was based on competent and substantial evidence, including findings of the church's misrepresentations and its conceded violations of provisions of the zoning ordinance, although the evidence was insufficient to support the board's finding that the proposed activities of the Unification Church posed a threat to public&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  health or morals.  The church's failure to comply with the intensity of use provisions of the zoning ordinance was a proper ground for denying the application, as were the misrepresentations made by the church which were directly related to land use while the application for a special use permit was pending; since the church would not comply with representations made while the application for a special use permit was pending, the zoning board could properly infer that it would not comply with conditions imposed on its proposed use; further the church's deceit, in and of itself, justified denial of the special use permit. Nor has the church established that the zoning board was biased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Proposed Religious Use</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In order to deny a special use permit for a religious use, it must be convincingly shown that the proposed use will have a direct and immediate adverse effect upon the health, safety or welfare of the community; every effort must be made to accommodate the religious use subject to conditions reasonably related to land use. Accordingly, where the Unification Church applied for a special use permit for the operation of a training&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and recruitment center, and there was substantial evidence that the regimen imposed by the church is not beneficial to the health of the participants, but not that the average participant is in imminent danger of losing his life or health, the evidence failed to demonstrate that the activities of the church posed a threat to public health or morals; public intolerance, animosity, or unrest does not justify a prohibition of free assembly and association.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant oil companies sought review of adverse judgments in three separate cases challenging the 1980 N.Y. Laws, chs. 271 and 272, (act), which imposed a franchise tax on oil corporations which was not to be passed on to consumers, known as an &quot;anti-pass-through&quot; provision. Three cases were consolidated for appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In response to a severe financial problem facing New York's public transportation system, the state enacted the act to create a special fund under the State Finance Law, from which allocations would be made to various regional transportation authorities by the franchise tax, known as an &quot;anti-pass-through&quot; provision. There also existed a &quot;self-destruct&quot; provision of the act, in which the tax ceased to be in force upon a judicial or administrative determination preventing enforcement. On appeal, the court modified judgment, and held that: (1) the anti-pass-through provision was void under the supremacy clause because up to expiration in 1981, federal statutes pre-empted the field of price regulation of petroleum products; and (2) the anti-pass-through provision was void under the commerce clause because the provision worked a discrimination by shifting the burden on the tax from New York customers to out of state customers. The court held that because the triggering events in the self-destruct provisions of the act were not met, the liability for the tax in question was permitted to accrue until a final appellate determination of the challenge to the anti-pass-through provision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Gross Profits Tax on Petroleum Producers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The amended statutory definition of &quot;oil company&quot; contained in section 182 (subd 2, par [a]) of the Tax Law (amd L 1981, ch 1043, &sect; 68), identifying the class of enterprises subject to a 2% gross profits tax as including certain vertically integrated petroleum corporations that exceed threshold amounts of crude oil production and refining capacity, does not deny plaintiffs the equal protection of the laws in thereby exempting other major oil industry competitors who either are not vertically integrated or lack the significant production or refining capacity required by the statute.  The Legislature could reasonably have concluded that the defined companies' corporate organization and the magnitude of their operations in every aspect of the petroleum industry afforded the statutory class a market power and economic advantage over their competitors&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and special opportunities to obtain the benefit of the conditions existing in the world-wide market; the equal protection clause does not prevent a State from taxing such economic power and competitive advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Gross Profits Tax on Petroleum Producers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The amended statutory definition of &quot;oil company&quot; contained in section 182 (subd 2, par [a]) of the Tax Law (amd L 1981, ch 1043, &sect; 68), identifying the class of enterprises subject to a 2% gross profits tax as including certain vertically integrated petroleum corporations that exceed threshold amounts of crude oil production and refining capacity, does not unlawfully discriminate against interstate commerce. In neither purpose nor effect does the tax discriminate, through the definition of &quot;oil company&quot;, against interstate petroleum producers in favor of intrastate products, or against the statutory class in favor of New York companies similarly situated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Gross Profits Tax on Petroleum Producers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The brief retroactive effect of a 2% gross profits tax imposed on certain oil companies (Tax Law, &sect; 182), arising out of its application to plaintiffs' gross receipts for their entire&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  taxable year within which the act became law (June 18, 1980), does not offend due process; nor does the hypothetically uneven effect of that limited retroactivity because of possible variations in corporate taxable years deny any &quot;oil company&quot; the equal protection of the laws; the administrative convenience of keying the tax to such companies' taxable years fully justifies any such discrepancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Gross Profits Tax on Petroleum Producers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. There is no constitutional infirmity in the State's applying a 2% gross profits tax, imposed on certain oil companies pursuant to section 182 of the Tax Law, to the sales of nonpetroleum products of the oil companies, while not taxing similar sales by their non-oil company competitors; since the equal protection clause does not prevent large vertically integrated oil companies from being singled out for the purpose of imposing a State tax, it follows that the tax thus imposed may reach activities for which others not in the class are not taxed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Gross Profits Tax on Petroleum Producers -- Anti-Pass-Through Provision</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Federal Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act and related regulations (US Code, tit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  15, &sect; 751 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.; 10 CFR Part 212) pre-empted the field of price regulation of petroleum products up to the point when the Federal statute expired on September 30, 1981; accordingly, enforcement of the anti-pass-through provision of section 182 (subd 11, par [a]) of the Tax Law, which imposes a 2% gross profits tax on certain oil companies while preventing such companies from passing this additional tax on the consumers of New York State, was invalid for the period from the inception of the act, June 18, 1980, to the date of the expiration of the Federal statute, as being in conflict with the supremacy clause, and plaintiffs were entitled to a declaration of that invalidity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Gross Profits Tax on Petroleum Producers -- Anti-Pass-Through Provision</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The anti-pass-through provision of section 182 (subd 11, par [a]) of the Tax Law, which imposes a 2% gross profits tax on profits generated by certain oil companies in New York State, while preventing said companies from passing this additional tax on to the State's consumers, works a discrimination violative of the commerce clause. The practical effect of the prohibition is to shift the direct burden of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the tax from the companies' New York customers to their out-of-State customers, in an attempt to recoup the cost of the tax on New York sales; the potentially affected class are therefore treated differently because of the pass-through prohibition and solely upon the basis of their geographical location.  If the anti-pass-through provision of the tax is upheld, the over-all inflationary impact of the tax would fall, not on New York's economy, but on those of its sister States, and this in turn would invite the kind of reciprocal reprisals to protect the economies of those States which the commerce clause was designed to prevent.</SPAN></P>

The scheme was not criminal, and was constitutionally permissible to achieve the regulatory objectives. While the recipient had a constitutional right to refuse to disclose self-incriminating information, the receipt of welfare benefits was not a fundamental right, and her failure to fulfill the reporting mandates of the agency, for whatever reason, made discontinuance of her benefits appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant commissioner ordered the revocation of diplomas for students who failed a competency test under N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 8, &sect; 103.2. Petitioner district filed a petition under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 to permanently enjoin enforcement of the order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commissioner ordered that diplomas of students who failed a competency test under N.Y. Comp. Code R. &amp; Regs. tit. 8, &sect; 103.2 would be revoked. The district filed a petition under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 to permanently enjoin enforcement of the order. The trial court granted the petition and taxed attorney's fees for the guardian ad litem against the commissioner. The commissioner and guardian ad litem appealed. The court held that N.Y. Comp. Code R. &amp; Regs. tit. 8, &sect; 103.2 did not (1) violate &sect; 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 because the students were not qualified handicapped individuals, (2) deny the students' rights to a free public education, (3) violate property and liberty interests under the Fourteenth Amendment because the students had a mental defect that prevented them from passing the competency test and the commissioner did not make any public statement about the students, or (4) violate the Equal Protection Clause because the competency test was reasonably related to the state's interest in the protection of the diploma's integrity. The court held that the attorney's fees should be taxed against the district because the district improperly issued the diplomas.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  adoption of regulations with respect to graduation requirements, including basic competency examinations, to establish a standard that would make a local high school diploma in New York a meaningful credential of the graduate is within the authority and power of respondent Commissioner of Education of the State of New York; control and management of educational affairs are vested in the Board of Regents and the Commissioner of Education, and determinations of the commissioner, unless patently violative of statutory or constitutional mandate, are beyond the range of judicial oversight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- Education of Handicapped Children</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Discrimination against a handicapped person in violation of section 794 of title 29 of the United States Code arises only when the benefits of a Federally funded program are denied to an individual who is able to meet a program's requirements in spite of his handicap. Accordingly, denial of a local high school diploma to petitioners, functionally handicapped students who failed to meet the requirement of 8 NYCRR 103.2 that all students pass basic competency tests in order to graduate from high school with a diploma, does not violate their rights&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under section 794; neither student completed the basic competency tests and, therefore, neither of them is an &quot;otherwise qualified handicapped individual&quot; within the meaning of the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- Education of Handicapped Children</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petitioners, functionally handicapped students who were provided with individualized education programs commensurate with their educational needs, were not denied their right to a &quot;free appropriate public education&quot; (US Code, tit 20, &sect; 1412, subd [1]) when they were denied local high school diplomas based on their failure to pass basic competency tests, successful completion of which is a prerequisite for graduation for all students (8 NYCRR 103.2).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- Education of Handicapped Children</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The promulgation of regulations is a legislative act and, for the purposes of actions under section 1983 of title 42 of the United States Code, respondents, the Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner of Education of the State of New York, have absolute immunity in actions pursuant to section 1983 to recover damages suffered as a result of a regulation promulgated by respondents which is allegedly in violation of Federal statute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (8 NYCRR 103.2); furthermore, as government officials performing discretionary functions, respondents acted as administrative officers in acting to enforce said regulation and are shielded from liability for civil damages to those affected thereby by a qualified immunity as long as their conduct did not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have been aware.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- Education of Handicapped Children</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A regulation promulgated by respondent Commissioner of Education of the State of New York requiring high school students to pass basic competency tests in language, arts and mathematics, which regulation became effective upon three years' notice, does not violate the due process rights of petitioners, functionally handicapped students who are not capable of satisfying said minimum achievement requirements (8 NYCRR 103.2); petitioners do not have a protected liberty interest in a diploma and the prior practice of petitioner board of education of awarding diplomas to students who only successfully completed individualized education programs was inconsistent with extant regulations and failed to create a legitimate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  expectation that could rise to the level of a property right in a diploma for unqualified students in successive classes.  Furthermore, the basic competency tests at issue, which are achievement tests structured so that the average ninth grade student can answer 80% of the questions correctly, are not invalid with respect to content.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- Education of Handicapped Children</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The policy of requiring all recipients of a local high school diploma to successfully complete basic competency tests which many handicapped students are not capable of passing (8 NYCRR 103.2) is not State action that intentionally discriminates against a class of persons grouped together by accidents of birth or living so as to invoke the so-called &quot;middle tier&quot; test enunciated in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Alevy v Downstate Med. Center of N. Y</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. (39 NY2d 326). Accordingly, said requirement does not violate the equal protection rights of petitioners, functionally handicapped students who are not able to pass such tests and will be denied high school diplomas; since the protection of the integrity of a high school diploma is both a legitimate State interest and one to which the competency testing program is reasonably&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  related, petitioners have failed to demonstrate the absence of a rational basis for said regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Costs -- Additional Allowances</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. A judgment denying a motion by petitioner board of education for a discretionary allowance pursuant to CPLR 8303 (subd [a], par 2) and additional disbursement for expert witness fees pursuant to CPLR 8301 (subd [a], par 12) is affirmed; further, counsel fees awarded to the guardian ad litem appointed to represent two functionally handicapped students in the proceeding should be assessed against petitioner, since it was the improper act of petitioner in awarding diplomas to unqualified handicapped students that prompted the administrative action taken by respondents to revoke such diplomas which became the subject of the instant proceeding.  </SPAN></P>

The bookstore obtained a certificate of occupancy and compliance to operate a retail business in a roadside business zone, but it objected to requirements imposed under Binghampton, N.Y., Code &sect; 703.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bookstore was required to submit a development plan to the Commission for prior approval, and it was also prohibited from use of signs on one side of its building. In compliance, the bookstore submitted a development plan for the Commission's prior approval, but it did so under protest. The bookstore maintained that its building was previously used and continued to be used in a &quot;retail business&quot; category. Respondents, however, had found that the bookstore had also added &quot;peep&quot; shows in the building, so they reclassified the building as an indoor recreational facility and indoor theater, and they imposed the conditions to buffer the property from an adjoining residential district. The court upheld the reclassification of the building's use and the restrictions on signs on one side, finding the requirements were not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. The court also ruled that while the bookstore's claim of unconstitutional vagueness of &sect; 703 was not properly presented, the claim was without merit. The court held that the disputed requirements were rationally based under &sect; 703 and that the record supported the zoning determinations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The assessment in question had been assessed upon a change in the taxpayer's capital structure from shares of par value stock to nonpar value stock. The taxpayer limited its appeal to the argument that the applicable statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 181, was unconstitutional as being violative of state and federal equal protection guarantees, and of the Commerce Clause. Specifically, the taxpayer challenged the constitutionality of a law which imposed a tax rate on the nonpar value shares of foreign corporations which was one cent higher than the rate imposed on domestic corporations. In the absence of legislative history conclusively bearing on the one cent differential between taxation of nonpar value shares of domestic and foreign corporations, the court accepted respondents' stated purpose for the statute. The court thus held that the challenged classification was sustainable as being rationally related to the state's legitimate interest in placing foreign corporations on an equal footing, tax wise, with domestic corporations. In affirming, the court concluded that in light of its equal protection analysis, it was unable to find that the license fee violated the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

In the charge concerning defendant's culpability for the acts of her codefendant, the trial court charged that a person was criminally liable for an offense not only when he directly committed it, but when he was present at &quot;or&quot; aided in its commission. The court found that although the trial court inadvertently used the disjunctive, rather than the conjunctive, the charge fairly and adequately described the state's burden in proving defendant's culpability for the acts of her codefendant when read as a whole. At the request of defendant's counsel, the trial court submitted to the jury, as a question of fact, the issue of whether the testimony of one of the state's witnesses should be treated as unsworn. The court concluded that the record established that the witness was competent to testify and that defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court's submission of this issue to the jury.</SPAN></P>

The second matter was brought to the court pursuant to an order of default that was issued by the court on a complainant's behalf, against respondent state employer that petitioner state agency sought to have enforced. Intervenor state comptroller sought leave to intervene and set aside the order because petitioner state agency threatened to initiate contempt proceedings for noncompliance. The court held that as to the first matter, there was no lawful predicate for petitioner commissioner's order. As to the second matter, the court permitted intervenors to proceed. The court held, however, that there was no jurisdictional infirmity or practical difficulty in intervenors' obeying the order, and therefore, denied the request to vacate the order.</SPAN></P>

A money award against the State of New York or one of its agencies can constitutionally be made by the Commissioner of Human Rights for unlawful discrimination in violation of the Human Rights Law (Executive Law, art 15; &sect; 297); furthermore, such an award may be enforced by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in a CPLR article 78 proceeding in the nature of mandamus rather than in the Court of Claims, since the State's liability has already been established by law and this is not the sort of unresolved claim against which the doctrine of sovereign immunity can properly be raised by the State.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The issue of whether there is substantial evidence to support an award by the Commissioner of Human Rights against the Department of Correctional Services for discrimination in employment was not waived by the department's failure to take an administrative appeal or to seek judicial review of the award; the issue must be resolved by the Appellate Division on an application to enforce the award under section 298 of the Executive Law using the same degree of scrutiny that would have been exercised on an application for judicial review. Furthermore, testimony by complainant correction officer, who was dismissed because his age at the time of his appointment exceeded the maximum age of 37 fixed by the department, constituted substantial evidence supporting an award of compensation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for mental anguish, where he stated that he was 45 when he was dismissed, that his age was known to his superiors, that he had resigned from a private sector position to rejoin the civil service at their urging and that he was the sole support of his wife and six children.</SPAN></P>

Law &sect; 27-a(d)(4)(a), and that the incorporation by reference of the federal standards in N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 12, pt. 800 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that (1) all federal OSHA regulations were to be adopted by the commissioner due to the statutory mandate of N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 27-a; (2) the entire text of the regulations must be filed; (3) the Freedom of Information Law request would become moot by the filing; and (4) because a rule-making proceeding had been initiated with regard to record-keeping regulations, a determination of their enforceability was unripe for judicial review.

In an administrative hearing, the landowners were assessed a penalty and were ordered to install water and sewage facilities. The commissioner brought an action to enforce the prior order. The trial court granted the commissioner's motion for summary judgment, and the court affirmed. The department had jurisdiction over the action because the parcels constituted a subdivision under N.Y. Pub.

The landowners could not rely on a possible retroactive application of a definitional amendment to &sect; 1115, which exempted plots of more than five acres from consideration in applying N.Y. Pub.

In affirming the judgment, the court held, inter alia, that where Local Law No. 30 was enacted solely as an exercise of the city's taxing power and had no purpose other than to raise revenue, the due process clause was not violated as that clause was applicable to a tax statute only if the statute was so arbitrary as to compel the conclusion that it was not an exercise of the taxing power.

The subject tax is imposed in a nondiscriminatory fashion upon importers and persons acquiring alcoholic beverages or producing them and is effective only upon the sale or use of such beverages in New York City after they have come to rest in the city, a purely local event; moreover, the tax is not on the act of transporting or shipping beer and liquor into the State, but upon the sale or distribution after they have come to rest in the city.</SPAN></P>

Local Law No. 30 of 1980 of the City of New York, which imposes an excise tax upon distributors and noncommercial importers of beer and alcohol which are sold or used in the city (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; Y46-2.0) does not constitute price fixing per se in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act (US Code, tit 15, &sect; 1 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.) and the supremacy clause (US Const, art VI, cl 2); the subject laws and regulations fall within the &quot;State action&quot; exemption to the Sherman Act and thus do not violate the act nor, by implication, the supremacy clause; the exemption applies since the excise tax was specifically authorized by State laws and enforced by State and municipal officials acting as State agents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Adoption of Inconsistent Laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. There is no inconsistency between Local Law No. 30 of 1980 of the City of New York, which imposes an excise tax upon distributors and noncommercial importers of beer and alcohol which are sold or used in the city (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; Y46-2.0), and section 101-b of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law which is violative of section 2 (subd [c], par [ii]) of article IX&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the New York Constitution.  Local Law No. 30 is solely revenue producing while section 101-b is purely regulatory; such statutes are to be harmonized whenever possible, and Local Law No. 30 and its enabling legislation,&nbsp;section 445 of the Tax Law, enacted long after section 101-b, should prevail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Local Laws -- Referendum Requirement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The technical violation of section 39 of the New York City Charter, which requires approval at a public referendum of any enactment transferring powers vested in a municipal agency to a nonmunicipal agency, does not void Local Law No. 30 of 1980 of the City of New York, which imposes an excise tax upon distributors and noncommercial importers of beer and alcohol which are sold or used in the city (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; Y46-2.0).  Although the power to collect excise taxes has been transferred to the State Tax Commission without referendum approval, the State, through the enabling act (Tax Law, &sect; 445) authorizing Local Law No. 30 and section Y46-2.0 of the Administrative Code, has effectively superseded the referendum requirement provision of section 39.</SPAN></P>

The statutes relate to different taxes from different sources, and may easily be harmonized since proceeds from State taxes inure to the State and those from the city tax revert to the city.</SPAN></P>

A civil penalty of $ 100 was imposed and its repair shop registration was suspended for 15 days. From the court's review of the record, the court was of the view that there was substantial evidence to support the determination that the repair shop willfully violated &sect; 82.5(g) in failing to provide quality repairs, and, therefore, respondents' determination should have been confirmed. It was also the opinion of the court that the punishment imposed was not so disproportionate to the offense as to be shocking to one's sense of fairness and, consequently, it should not have been disturbed. In the court's view, the regulation in question met the constitutional standard and the repair shop had failed in its burden of demonstrating that the regulation was unconstitutionally vague. Consequently, respondents' determination had to be confirmed and the constitutionality of &sect; 82.5(g) was declared.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The planning board was granted authority by the town board pursuant to N.Y. Town Law &sect; 281 to employ clustering for the land owner's proposed development and to modify applicable provisions of the town zoning ordinance for the proposed subdivision. The developer opposed dedicating 4.5 acres of the 11-acre plat to the town for an &quot;open space&quot; because of concerns that the area would become a gathering place for teenagers. The developer contended that to impose such a condition was an arbitrary taking of his property. The court reversed the trial court, holding that &sect; 281, the enabling legislation for cluster zoning, authorized the town legislative body to delegate to the planning board power to permit deviation from the zoning regulations provided that the total density of the subdivision was maintained. The court ruled that the scope of this grant of power included the imposition of the open space condition to assure that conservation, recreational, and public purposes were served. The court deemed such a construction was consistent with the language and history of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The administrator, who was licensed to practice in New York, entered a plea of guilty to the sixth count of an indictment handed down in New Jersey.

The court determined that the conduct charged in the sixth count of the indictment would have constituted the crime of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree in New York. The court explained that it was properly determined that the administrator's New Jersey conviction should have been deemed a felony conviction in New York, which required the forfeiture of his license pursuant to N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2897(2), para. (a). The court concluded that the order of the trial court did not bar the use of the administrator's conviction in requiring the forfeiture of his license in view of the express prohibition against applying the order to a civil proceeding commenced on behalf of the state government.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the unconstitutional composition of the grand jury was among those defects considered to be of a nonjurisdictional nature. The court concluded that defendant was foreclosed from obtaining appellate review of the issue of the grand jury's composition because no state statute specifically permitted him to plead guilty and obtain such review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant town challenged an order of the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), which held, in appellee property owner's action alleging that zoning ordinances passed by appellant were unconstitutional and invalid, that seven out of eight zoning amendments enacted by appellant were valid and which directed that the zoning ordinance be published.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to a prior judgment, appellant adopted a new zoning ordinance that affected eight sites at various locations and did not include a severability clause. After protests against the proposed amendments were registered by certain property owners, the town refused to publish the amendments, thereby precluding their taking effect. A trial court held that insofar as the amended ordinance affected property in one certain location, it had not been properly enacted and ordered appellant to publish the ordinance. On appeal, the court affirmed. It held that appellant was required to publish the zoning amendments. The court found that the zoning amendments, affecting eight discrete sites within the town, should be considered as if they had been separately enacted. With respect to one site, where the owners of 20 percent of the affected adjacent or opposite land registered protests, the zoning amendment could not be deemed to have been validly enacted. However, with respect to the other seven sites, where 20 percent of the owners of affected adjacent or opposite land did not register protests, the ordinance was valid and appellant was required to publish them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Necessary Parties</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Notwithstanding the fact that a property owner has styled its action as one for a judgment declaring that certain zoning amendments passed by a town board were validly enacted, the matter is a proceeding in the nature of mandamus ( CPLR art 78) for an order directing the town to perform a duty&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  enjoined upon it by law, specifically, to publish the zoning amendments.  Accordingly, the officer whose conduct is to be controlled is the only necessary party respondent in the proceeding, and, since the town was properly made a party to the suit, the court has jurisdiction to reach the merits; the other owners of land affected by the zoning amendments, although they may be proper parties, are not necessary parties thereto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Zoning amendments were validly passed by a 3 to 2 vote by the town board of respondent town, contrary to the recommendations of the Westchester County Planning Board, since the requirement of section 277.61 of the Westchester County Administrative Code that such amendments be passed by a simple majority vote was met, despite the fact that the vote did not satisfy the conflicting requirement of section 239-m of the General Municipal Law that such proposed zoning actions pass the town board by a vote of a majority plus one where the town board acts contrary to planning board recommendations; the Westchester County Administrative Code provision is controlling, since such a special statute repeals a conflicting general&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  statute insofar as the special act applies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Zoning amendments that affect eight discrete sites within respondent town and were passed as a set with no severability clause by a 3 to 2 vote of the town board, should be considered as if they had been separately enacted for purposes of section 265 of the Town Law, which provides that if protests are registered against a zoning change by the owners of at least 20% of the total land affected by the amendments, or adjacent or opposite thereto, the change can become effective only upon approval by three fourths of the members of the town board. Accordingly, with respect to the site where 20% of the affected land owners registered protests, the zoning amendment cannot be deemed to have been validly enacted; however, with respect to the remaining seven sites, where the requisite number of affected landowners did not register protests, the amendments relating thereto were validly enacted and the town is required to publish them.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a taxpayer and his children, challenged an order of the Supreme Court in Albany County, which denied plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and granted the motions to dismiss filed by defendants, a school and district and its board of education. In their complaint, plaintiffs alleged that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2023 was unconstitutional after defendants' proposed budget was defeated by voters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the proposed budget was defeated, the board instituted an austerity budget with appropriations for teachers' salaries and items that the board regarded as &quot;ordinary contingent expenses&quot; authorized by &sect; 2023. The board did not provide for interscholastic athletics, additional library services, and a marching band. Plaintiffs argued that &sect; 2023 was an unconstitutionally vague delegation of the taxing power because it empowered the board of education, without voter approval, to levy a tax that had no statutory limit for &quot;ordinary contingent expenses, &quot; an undefined phrase. They further argued that &sect; 2023 failed to furnish a satisfactory standard to guide the board and, thus, created an unwarranted and void delegation of legislative power. The court held that &sect; 2023 was constitutional and that even though it contained general language, it was not so imprecise that it was constitutionally defective. The court also rejected plaintiffs' argument that the austerity budget violated equal protection and held that the principle of local control of educational funding justified variations in school district financing and expenditures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the decisions by the Supreme Court, Richmond County (New York), which convicted defendant, upon his pleas of guilty, of two counts of robbery in the first degree. Following a hearing, defendant was found to be a second felony offender. Accordingly, he was sentenced, pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.06, to concurrent 6 to 12 year terms of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that he was erroneously sentenced as a second felony offender because the 1972 California burglary conviction was classified as a misdemeanor under California law. The court determined that although it was true, as a general principle, that local policy might not have overridden the constitutional requirement of full faith and credit, the nature of the federal union of states to which were reserved some of the attributes of sovereignty, precluded resort to the full faith and credit clause of the Federal Constitution to compel one state to subordinate its own laws and policies concerning its domestic affairs to the laws and policies of other states. The law of the State of New York was clear and firm that one who committed a felony in New York was to be sentenced as a second felony offender if he had committed a prior out-of-state offense and the punishment authorized in New York for that offense was a term of imprisonment in excess of one year. New York had the sovereign power to adopt that policy in the conduct of its domestic affairs and the full faith and credit clause did not deprive it of such power or require it to subvert that policy in the case at bar.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under section 70.06 of the Penal Law the sentencing court properly used defendant's 1972 California burglary conviction as a predicate offense for second felony offender treatment upon his conviction of a felony in New York, despite the fact that said burglary conviction was denominated a misdemeanor under California law, since that crime would be a felony in this State for which a term of imprisonment in excess of one year may be imposed and, in fact, the California offense carried a possible penalty of one to fourteen years' imprisonment. Furthermore, the full faith and credit clause does not deprive this State of its sovereign power to adopt said policy in the conduct of its domestic affairs or require it to subvert that policy in the case at bar, nor does the use of the California conviction, which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  took place prior to the enactment of section 70.06, as a predicate offense enlarge the prior conviction or retroactively increase the penalty therefor in violation of the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the letters of protest accompanying the payments constituted substantial compliance with &sect; 3813(1) and granted leave to verify the protest letters. The court modified the order, finding that it was not necessary for the power company to verify the protest letters because &sect; 3813(1) did not apply to the action and affirmed the denial of the city school district's motion to dismiss. Specifically, the court held that because the power company's action attacked the very jurisdiction of the taxing authorities, &sect; 3813(1) did not apply and that the letters of protest had provided the city school district with sufficient notice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court erred in denying plaintiffs' motion for a trial continuance where plaintiffs' counsel did not learn until after the trial had started that an eyewitness whose testimony was crucial to plaintiffs' consolidated cases would be unavailable for several days and defendants would not have been prejudiced by granting a continuance until the witness could appear ( CPLR 4402), and it was also error to dismiss plaintiffs' cases immediately following denial of the application for a continuance although no motion to dismiss had been made by defendants; moreover, in deferring to an Administrative Judge with respect to whether to grant the application for a continuance, the Trial Judge relinquished his exclusive judicial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  authority over the ongoing proceeding and the statutory power vested in him to make such decisions ( CPLR 4402).  Furthermore, when plaintiffs later moved to set aside the trial order of dismissal and to restore the case to the Trial Calendar, the court erred in treating the application as a posttrial motion for judgment and new trial under CPLR 4404 and in denying the application as untimely under CPLR 4405, which was likewise inapplicable.  Accordingly, plaintiffs' application to set aside the trial court's dismissal of the actions and to restore the cases to the Trial Calendar is granted.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court, in dismissing the district attorney's petitions to compel retroactive compensation from the county, held that &sect; 183a was unconstitutional because it lacked a rational basis. On appeal, the court reversed and held that &sect; 183a's salary requirements were reasonably connected to the state's interest in maintaining competent district attorneys, and, therefore, the constitutional challenge failed. Also, the district attorney was not a state officer within the meaning of N.Y. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff apartment information vendor appealed from an order of the Supreme Court at Special Term in Erie County (New York), which denied its motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent defendant State of New York from enforcing the provisions of 19 NYCRR 190.8. The vendor asserted that the regulation violated commercial free speech rights under the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An apartment information vendor challenged the constitutionality of several state regulations governing its business, including the fees charged to customers, the necessity of requiring written authorization from apartment owners before listing their apartments, and the ban on naming any specific apartments in its advertising. The trial court found that the vendor would not prevail on the merits and the court on appeal agreed as to the fee question and the written authorization question. However, the court found that the vendor would likely prevail on the advertising question because the state's restrictions were more onerous than necessary to accomplish its purposes. The court held that 19 NYCRR 190.8 did involve potentially misleading advertising, that the state had a substantial governmental interest in protecting the public from deceitful practices, and that the restrictions imposed directly advanced that governmental interest. But the court ruled that the ban on all advertising of specific apartments available for rental went to a goal that could have been achieved by less restrictive means, in order to allow the vendor its First Amendment commercial speech rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment in favor of the state and granted a preliminary injunction to prevent the enforcement of the advertising portions of the challenged regulation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The nonresident taxpayers sought to deduct from their state income tax the moving expenses that they incurred in a job-related move to another state.

The nonresident taxpayers carried their burden of proof in the proceedings. The modern rule under the Privileges and Immunities Clause forbade discrimination against citizens of other states where there was no substantial reason for the discrimination beyond the mere fact that they were citizens of other states. The Privileges and Immunities Clause did not require absolute equality. Instead, the question was whether the distinction between residents and nonresidents was a reasonable one, based upon &quot;valid independent reasons.&quot; The Tax Commission's distinction lacked the necessary support.

The trial court held that N.Y. Gen. Bus.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Congress enacted the EPAA in 1973 to established federal price control authority over certain oil products. An amendment to the act authorized the President to exempt petroleum products from fuel controls and to convert such controls from mandatory to standby status.  15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 760a. In 1979 the New York State Legislature enacted N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 396-r to discourage price gouging by merchants selling oil to be used for home heating. When a consumer complained of the oil company's price, the state brought an action alleging that the oil company's price grossly exceeded prevailing prices and was unconscionably excessive under &sect; 396-r. On appeal, the court affirmed. By regulation, residential fuel oil had been exempted from federal price controls in an effort to reach an unregulated market. The court agreed that by occupying the field and specifically exempting heating oil, Congress left no room for state regulation. New York's regulation was both preempted by and in conflict with the federal law and thus, was unconstitutional at the time on the facts of the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landlords in two consolidated actions sought review of orders of the Supreme Court, Rockland County (New York), which held that the rent control provisions of the Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 1974 (ETPA), N.Y. Laws 1974, ch. 57, were constitutional, and granted the motion of respondent New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal to temporarily enjoin the landlords from violating the ETPA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the landlords challenged the trial court's finding that the ETPA was not unconstitutional, and sought a declaration with respect to the initial legal regulated rent on their properties. On appeal, the court held (1) in consideration of the notice of the public hearing as a prerequisite to the implementation of rent controls, the landlords' due process rights were not violated by the lack of actual notice in the invocation of a local housing emergency under the ETPA, (2) the ETPA, under N.Y. Laws 1974, ch. 57, &sect; 9a, did not deprive the landlords of equal protection of the laws by treating them differently than owners of other apartments that were never subject to the Emergency Housing Rent Control Law, N.Y. Laws 1946, ch. 274, &sect; 17, as amended, (3) the landlords were not entitled to unusual remedies to change the date in which the initial legal regulated rent applicable to the landlords was determined, and (4) the division did not waive the 60-day time limitation of N.Y. Laws 1974, ch. 57, &sect; 9a under which the landlords seeking an adjustment of the initial legal regulated rent were required to file an application.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Rent Regulation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The notice provisions of the Emergency Tenant Protection Act (L 1974, ch 576) (ETPA) do not violate the due process rights of plaintiff landlords, since notice of a public hearing, which is a prerequisite for the declaration of a local housing emergency (ETPA, &sect; 3, subd&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  c) is notice reasonably calculated to apprise landlords of the adoption of a village resolution declaring an emergency which would invoke the ETPA; due process does not require that each affected landlord be individually notified of the invocation of the ETPA.  Furthermore, plaintiffs were on constructive notice of such action, since the village had previously invoked the ETPA and legal challenges to the validity of that action were still pending in the courts, and the landlords had also obtained a copy of the local resolution within 60 days of its adoption, the time in which an owner may apply for an adjustment of the initial legal regulated rent under subdivision a of section 9 of the ETPA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Rent Regulation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The provisions of section 9 of the Emergency Tenant Protection Act (L 1974, ch 576) (ETPA) do not deny landlords due process because of a lack of notice, nor do they deprive them of equal protection; the different treatment of landlords and tenants under section 9 of the ETPA is negligible and has a rational basis, since, inasmuch as the purpose of the ETPA is to prevent the exaction of unwarranted and excessive rent increases which would result&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from a shortage in housing, it is understandable that tenants would be afforded greater protection thereunder than the owners of such housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Rent Regulation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plaintiff landlords are not entitled to a judgment declaring that the initial legal regulated rent applicable to their property on the effective date of rent regulation under a village resolution invoking the Emergency Tenant Protection Act (L 1974, ch 576) be deemed the fair market rental on that date, rather than the rents fixed under an invalid prior resolution that had continued in effect through the date of the new resolution by virtue of statutory stays pending appeals by the village; although a party may be entitled to &quot;unusual remedies&quot; when his rights are frustrated by &quot;calculated action&quot; of municipal authorities, here the appeal process relative to the prior resolution was not unduly slow and landlords did not adduce proof that the village deliberately or negligently stalled the process of the appeal so as to frustrate the legitimate pursuits of the landlords. Furthermore, the landlords failed to take steps to hasten the decision of the appeal, which they could have done by intervening&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as of right in the appeal and either moving to vacate the statutory stay or to dismiss the appeal as abandoned if it was not timely perfected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Rent Regulation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A village resolution invoking the Emergency Tenant Protection Act (L 1974, ch 576) (ETPA), passed while rents were regulated under a prior, invalidated resolution that continued in effect by reason of statutory stays pending appeals by the village, was not a &quot;backstop&quot; resolution which would take effect only if, and when, the validity of the prior resolution was determined adversely to the village, although the result was that the rents established under the prior resolution continued under the new one; the effective date of the resolution was the first day of the month following the declaration of a housing emergency by the village, as that prescribed by subdivision a of section 6 of the ETPA, which statutorily prescribed effective date cannot be varied by the municipality or by the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Law of the Case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The &quot;law of the case&quot; rule applies only to courts of co-ordinate jurisdiction and not to an appellate court; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  accordingly, the trial court's determination as to the legal effect of a village resolution does not constitute the law of the case on appeal to the Appellate Division, the issue not having been considered on prior, related appeals to the Appellate Division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Limitation of Actions -- Emergency Tenant Protection Act</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The 60-day time limitation prescribed by subdivision a of section 9 of the Emergency Tenant Protection Act(L 1974, ch 576) within which a landlord may file an application for an adjustment of the initial legal regulated rent after the effective date of a local legislative resolution declaring a housing emergency, is not a Statute of Limitations to be affirmatively pleaded; such an application is not subject to the affirmative pleading requirement of CPLR 3018 (subd [b]) as it is not an &quot;action&quot; within the meaning of CPLR 201 and, since the 60-day period is an integral part of the application in the nature of a condition precedent, the failure to comply therewith extinguishes the right and the time limitation need not be asserted as an affirmative defense to an action based on such a right.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants appealed from the Suffolk County Court (New York), where they were convicted of assault in the first degree. Defendants claimed selective and discriminatory enforcement of prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were convicted of assault in the first degree after their involvement in a barroom brawl. Defendants alleged selective or discriminatory enforcement in their prosecution, since none of the white patrons involved were prosecuted. The court found no discriminatory or selective enforcement in prosecution since defendants were the only ones involved in the brawl who saw fit to employ dangerous instruments. However, the court reversed defendants' convictions since they were deprived of a fair trial by the improper limitation of their right to cross-examine. The trial court's stern warning of defense counsel of the legal considerations implicated by cross-examination touching on the acts of the other's clients could not have had other than a chilling effect upon each counsel's willingness to cross-examine vigorously.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed defendants' convictions for assault in the first degree since defendants were deprived of a fair trial by the improper limitation of their right to cross-examine.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The claim of discriminatory enforcement should not be considered as an affirmative defense to a criminal charge, to be determined together with the issue of guilt by the trier of fact, but, rather, should be addressed to the court before trial as a motion to dismiss the prosecution upon constitutional grounds.  Accordingly, in a prosecution for assault, where the defendants made no pretrial motion to dismiss on grounds of selective enforcement, raising the issue for the first time on appeal, it has not been properly preserved for review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> of Laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a prosecution for assault, following a fight outside a bar, pitting a group of six white men against five black men, including defendants, an allegation by defendants, the only two charged, that they were the victims of discriminatory enforcement of the law because the decision to prosecute them was based largely on their race, long-standing animosity between them and the police, and the fact that the prevailing custom in the county was not to enforce assault statutes with respect to barroom brawls, is not supported by the record, which shows that the decision to prosecute the defendants was predicated on their different and more culpable conduct, including the employment of dangerous instruments, and not on any improper or discriminatory consideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right of Confrontation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A defendant may inquire of witnesses concerning the codefendant's alleged participation in the alleged crime; the denial of the opportunity to make such relevant inquiry abridges the defendant's constitutional right of confrontation and deprives him of a fair trial. Accordingly, in a prosecution for assault, where the trial court sternly warned each defense counsel that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  serious legal and ethical considerations were implicated by cross-examination touching on the acts of the other's client, this warning, taken &quot;very seriously&quot;, inappropriately abridged the constitutional rights of both defendants, since it could not have had other than a chilling effect upon each counsel's willingness to cross-examine vigorously and thoroughly in the area of dispute.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant husband challenged the decision of the Supreme Court at Special Term, Richmond County (New York), which denied the husband's motion for partial summary judgment in respondent wife's action for, inter alia, rescission of the parties' separation agreement as violative of former N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law &sect; 5-311, which had been previously repealed -- the current section being in effect at the commencement of the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties separation agreement provided for a limitation on the husband's liability to support his wife, in violation of former N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law &sect; 5-311, which was in force at the time. The wife later sought recission of the agreement, and the husband sought partial summary judgment. The trial court found in favor of the wife, and on appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order as modified. The court held that current N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law &sect; 5-311, which provided that either spouse could waive his or her right to support as long as he or she was not likely to become a public charge, was the applicable law, and that, consequently, the support provisions of the separation agreement were valid and enforceable, because the former section was repealed by acts of the legislature constituting measures of public policy. By reason of a retroactive application of current &sect; 5-311, the husband was insulated from the wife's claim that said provisions were illegal. The husband's other contentions were found to have been academic or without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's order, as modified by granting the husband's motion only to the extent of dismissing the wife's first cause of action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Husband and Wife -- Support</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although contracts made by private parties must necessarily be construed in the light of the applicable law at the time of their execution, a contract may be affected by subsequent legislation in the exercise of the police power, or by a subsequent statute announcing a new public policy or by repeal of a prohibitory statute rendering invalid a contract violative of its provisions, and such a repeal will render the contract valid and enforceable and not subject to the defense of illegality; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  accordingly, a separation agreement containing a partial waiver of the husband's wife support obligation, executed prior to the enactment of current section 5-311 of the General Obligations Law, is valid and enforceable and not subject to a claim of illegality, since the statute prohibiting such a waiver was repealed by acts of the Legislature constituting measures of public policy. In cases involving the enforceability of separation agreements, the retroactive application of current section 5-311 may be used as a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">shield</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against a claim of illegality based solely on the former law, but may not be used as a sword in seeking to invalidate agreements, on constitutional grounds, as not having been executed in reliance on the gender-neutral standards incorporated in the new law and public policy of the State.  </SPAN></P>

Moreover, the mother failed to demonstrate that she was aggrieved by the social services statute's failure to provide for oral notification of a parent's right to an attorney and the possibility of the termination of parental rights if she failed to comply with the agreement she had entered into with the department and, thus, she could not raise the statute's constitutionality.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant state tax commission sought review of a judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), which ordered the commission to pay interest on a refund of taxes paid by respondent taxpayer in an action by the taxpayer alleging that the taxpayer was immune from taxation because the funds upon which the mortgage tax was applied were loaned to the taxpayer by a state agency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commission asserted that the action was improper because the taxpayer did not join the City of New York as a necessary party and that the taxpayer was not entitled to recover interest on the refund. The court rejected the commission's contentions, finding that the taxpayer's failure to join the City of New York was excusable because the city was not a necessary party and because the city's interests were adequately protected. The court ruled that the taxpayer was entitled to recover interest on the refund because the imposition of the tax was unlawful. The court noted that the taxpayer was immune from the imposition of the tax because funds upon which the mortgage tax was applied were loaned to the taxpayer by a state agency which was immune from taxation and because the funds were primarily maintained for a public use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court. The court held that the taxpayer was entitled to interest on the tax refund he received because a state agency's immunity from taxation was not negated by the fact that the state agency's funds were loaned to a taxpayer that was a private party.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Necessary Parties</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The failure to join the City of New York, which, through the New York City Register, collected the mortgage recording tax imposed under article 11 of the Tax Law, as a respondent in a proceeding by petitioner taxpayer challenging the imposition of the tax and demanding interest on the refund due, should be excused in the interests of justice ( CPLR 1001, subd [b]), since respondent State Tax Commission failed to raise the issue at any time during the three-year history of the case and the city itself failed to move to intervene either at the administrative level or in the court proceeding; in any event, the city, which is merely a collection agent for the State Tax Commission with respect to such taxes, is not a necessary party.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2. As a State agency, the New York State Employees' Retirement System enjoys an immunity from taxation independent of the statutory exemptions listed in the Tax Law for property utilized in the public interest, and the fact that retirement system property consisting of funds was loaned to a private party and secured by a mortgage does not negate this immunity, since retirement system funds are primarily maintained for a public use. Accordingly, since the imposition of a mortgage recording tax upon petitioner mortgagor pursuant to section 253 of the Tax Law was unlawful, the recovery of interest upon the tax refund due from respondent State Tax Commission must be allowed, even in the absence of a specific provision for interest in the taxing statute; petitioner is entitled to interest at the rate of 6% per annum under section 16 of the State Finance Law.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court granted appellant hospital's motion for summary judgment prohibiting the commissioner from taking further action to modify the hospital's operating certificate but dismissed that portion of the complaint seeking a declaration that the statute was unconstitutional. On cross-appeals, the commissioner asserted error in granting the hospital's motion for summary judgment and the hospital asserted error in dismissing its constitutional claims. The court reversed the order of the trial court and granted summary judgment in favor of the commissioner dismissing the complaint because the commissioner was within his authority, the statute did apply to the hospital, and the court held that the terms &quot;public need&quot; and &quot;public interest&quot; were sufficiently defined to withstand constitutional attack for a lack of specificity or definiteness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his sentence of one to three years ordered by the Supreme Court in Kings County (New York) for attempted robbery in the second degree under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.02(c). Defendant claimed that he should have been granted youthful offender status pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law 720.10(3)(i) because of mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the age of 16, defendant and three others approached two victims. Defendant produced a gun and threatened the victims. One of defendant's friends took a medallion from one victim. Shortly thereafter, defendant and his friends fled the scene and were apprehended by the police. While in flight, the arresting officer saw defendant place the gun in a garbage can. The weapon was only a starter pistol, incapable of discharging a bullet. Defendant pled guilty to attempted robbery in the second degree under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.02(c) and was sentenced to one to three years. Defendant appealed, claiming that in view of his prior clean record and the fact that the gun could not discharge, he should have been afforded youthful offender treatment pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law 720.10(3)(i). The court held that the lower court did not abuse its discretion because the fact that the pistol could not discharge was not a mitigating circumstance bearing directly on how the crime was committed to have permitted the court to grant such status. The court explained that it was not a mitigating circumstance because N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.02(c) merely required the display of what appeared to be a pistol.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Supreme Court of New York, Bronx County, convicting defendant of criminal usury in the first degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed defendant's conviction for criminal usury in the first degree. The court held that the trial court improperly admitted hearsay statements of an alleged co-conspirator against defendant with no prima facie showing of a conspiracy established without recourse to the challenged statements. A witness testified about statements made by an alleged conspirator, but the statements were not made when defendant was present, nor was there any other evidence establishing a conspiracy. Absent evidence of a conspiracy independent of the challenged statements, statements made by the alleged co-conspirator were not admissible against defendant. The court therefore reversed the conviction and dismissed the indictment.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, the judgment convicting defendant of criminal usury is reversed and the indictment dismissed, where the testimony of the People's sole witness established only that the witness borrowed money from and made payments to defendant's alleged accomplice and that defendant appeared at about&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the time of the witness' meetings with others to obtain funds on four occasions and also &quot;happened to come up&quot; at the conclusion of the witness' meeting with the alleged accomplice after the money changed hands; the out-of-court declarations of defendant's alleged coconspirator and accomplice that defendant was the source of some of the money and was receiving some of the interest thereon, made to the witness out of the presence of defendant, were never rendered admissible against defendant and, without these declarations, the prosecution must fail.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff city filed a class action seeking an order establishing the rights of defendant taxpayers to a refund from an unconstitutional property tax. Defendant utilities appealed the order of the Supreme Court at Special Term, Monroe County (New York) that certified the class action and dismissed the utilities' individual actions. The city and taxpayers appealed the order providing that nonprotesting taxpayers were entitled to a refund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A property tax was declared unconstitutional. The city filed a class action, seeking a declaration of its rights and liabilities with respect to refunding the taxes paid. The class action was certified after it was subdivided into four subclasses, a law firm was appointed to represent the entire class, and several individual actions were dismissed or consolidated. The trial court determined that taxpayers who paid the tax without protest were legally entitled to refunds. The court reversed the order allowing nonprotesting taxpayers to recover a refund; formal written protest was necessary to receive a refund as there was no evidence that the tax was paid by such nonprotesting taxpayers under duress. On remand, the trial court was instructed to consider whether the nonprotesting taxpayers would be entitled to a refund under any other laws. The court found that a class action was properly certified but modified the four subclasses so that conflicting interests did not inhere in any single subclass. On remand, the trial court was directed to consider whether the legal representative could represent the class as a whole or whether separate counsel was required for each subclass.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order that certified the class action was modified to create different subclasses of taxpayers; on remand, the trial court had to appoint legal representation either for the general class or for each subclass. The order that awarded nonprotesting taxpayers a refund was reversed; on remand, the trial court was directed to determine the legality of the payment of the refund to such taxpayers in light of other laws.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Actions -- Class Actions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. It was error to dismiss actions by plaintiffs, local public utilities, against defendant city for tax refunds for excess real property taxes they paid during a four-year period on the ground that another action was already pending between the parties ( CPLR 3211, subd [a], par 4), where plaintiffs' actions were commenced the same day that the city commenced a class action seeking declaratory relief establishing the rights and liabilities of all taxpayers in those years and a court order directing a method of payment to those entitled to a tax refund; the class action cannot be said to have preceded plaintiffs' actions and, accordingly, the proper procedure was for the court to join plaintiffs' actions with the class action, as it did with other actions that had been commenced prior to the class action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Tax Refund Proceeding -- Payment under Protest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A taxpayer is entitled to a refund for the payment of illegal taxes only if he can show that the payment was made under protest&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or was otherwise involuntarily made and, accordingly, those taxpayers who did not protest the payment of real property taxes which were subsequently found to have been excessive, and were not subject to any immediate threat to the possession or use of the real property except that a lien was routinely created against the property by plaintiff city until the tax was paid, are not entitled as a matter of legal right to a tax refund for the years in question; the fact that there is a lien against the real property is not the kind of duress which makes the tax payment involuntary so as to excuse the lack of formal protest by the taxpayer.  However, the issue of whether the city may nonetheless make tax refund payments to nonprotesters under the theory that such payments constitute equitable claims under subdivision 5 of section 20 of the General City Law is remitted to Special Term for determination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Actions -- Class Actions -- Representation of Subclasses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a class action commenced by a city for declaratory relief and an order directing a method of payment to those taxpayers found to be entitled to a tax refund for excess real property taxes paid over a four-year period, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the appointment of one law firm to represent the general class of all taxpayers who paid taxes during those years and the creation of a subclass with separate counsel to represent those taxpayers who paid taxes under protest and who object to nonprotesters receiving refunds, creates an inherent conflict of interest for the firm representing the general class, where only limited funds are available to pay claims, which may be compromised, as this may well set those who paid the taxes under protest and are legally entitled to a refund against and those who did not make the requisite formal protest. Accordingly, representation of the general class should be eliminated and a new subclass created consisting only of nonprotesters, and the subclass of protesters should be expanded to cover all protesters, not merely those who protest and also object to payment of nonprotesters. </SPAN></P>

Penal Law &sect; 70.06, as applied to him, was an ex post facto law and, therefore, unconstitutional. He argued that he received a heavier sentence as a second felony offender and that the predicate felony conviction, which served as the foundation therefor under the provisions of the challenged statute, was obtained prior to the enactment of the statute. The court rejected the theory that these circumstances rendered the statute an ex post facto law as applied to defendant because the increased punishment was inflicted for the second crime only and was not an additional penalty for the prior offense.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also asserted that since the death penalty statute for murder in the first degree was unconstitutional, he could not constitutionally be convicted of attempting to commit a crime that did not exist. The court affirmed the conviction, but held that the sentence was excessive and accordingly reduced it to 15 years to life. The court concluded that the jury instructions were proper and did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV's requirement that a state prove every element of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78, petitioner consumers requested review of a determination of respondent public service commission that upheld the legality of fuel adjustment clauses in the tariff of New York State electric utilities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The fuel adjustment clauses in the tariff of each New York State electric utility permitted the utilities to use a formula to adjust their rates for electricity. The formula permitted the utilities to automatically pass through increases in the cost of the utilities' fuel to consumers. The consumers sought to annul a public service commission decision upholding the fuel adjustment clauses, claiming that the determination was illegal and unconstitutional. The court confirmed the determination and dismissed the petition. The court held that the public service commission had the authority to authorize the fuel adjustment clauses pursuant to N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law &sect;&sect; 66, 72, 72-a because the clauses survived the procedural requirements of N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law &sect;&sect; 66(12), and the public service commission monitored the fuel adjustments on a continuing basis. In addition, the fuel adjustment clause was a fixed rule under which future rates were determined. It was not retroactive rate-making, since the utilities were not being permitted to recoup past earning deficiencies The court also held that the consumers did not have procedural rights to attack the rates beyond those granted by statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Where the Supreme Court transfers a CPLR article 78 proceeding to the Appellate Division even though it involves only questions of law which should have been decided by Special Term, the Appellate Division may decide the issues as if they had properly come before that court if the record is sufficient to dispose of the issues raised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Utilities -- Fuel Adjustment Clause</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A fuel adjustment clause, contained in the tariff of each New York State utility and designed to reflect monthly increases above or decreases below the &quot;base cost&quot; for fuel used by the utility, is a legal rate-making device necessary to maintain the financial integrity of utility companies and to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  establish reasonable rates for consumers; such clauses do not do violence to the system of fixed rates since initial approval and any subsequent change are subject to the provisions requiring public notice and hearing as in any rate change and are thus within the statutory authority of the Public Service Commission in its determination of a just and reasonable rate. The fuel adjustment clause, which is a fixed rule under which future rates to be charged to the public are determined, is not retroactive rate-making, since the utilities are not being permitted to recoup past earning deficiencies, and inasmuch as consumers possess only the procedural rights given to them by statute, there is no unconstitutional deprivation of due process.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the Two-family Review Board of the town of Babylon (review board), sought review of an order of the Supreme Court at Special Term, Suffolk County (New York), which ruled in favor of respondent homeowner's neighbors in their suit to have the review board's special permit for intervenor homeowner allowing a zoning exception and a local law declared invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The town enacted a local law which created a Two-family Review Board empowered to conduct public hearings and determine special permit applications by those who owned illegally converted two-family houses or who intended to undertake such a conversion. A homeowner applied for a special permit to convert his single-family home to two-family use. The review board approved the application and granted the permit. However, the homeowner's neighbors filed suit to declare the permit and a local law invalid, arguing that the local law violated N.Y. Town Law &sect; 267 because it delegated powers to the review board instead of the zoning board of appeals and because it was not in accordance with a comprehensive plan. The trial court ruled in favor of the neighbors. On appeal, the court reversed, and held that the determination of the review board granting the special permit was valid. Also, the local law was valid because a town was able to adopt zoning regulations by virtue of its Municipal Home Rule Law powers, as well as those granted by town law. However, the court ruled that the review board's determination was annulled because there were no findings of fact.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A local law enacted to deal with the problem of unauthorized conversions of one-family homes for two-family use which provided for selective grants of temporary permits for two-family homes and created a Two-Family Review Board empowered to conduct public hearings and determine special permit applications by those who owned illegally converted two-family houses or intended to undertake such conversion does not violate section 267 of the Town Law because it delegates powers to the Two-Family Review Board instead of to the Zoning Board of Appeals, since a 1976 amendment to section 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law (see L 1976, ch 365) permits supersession or amendment of the Town Law with relation to the &quot;property, affairs or government of the town&quot; and to &quot;other matters in relation to which and to the extent to which [the town] is authorized to adopt local laws&quot;; nothing in section 267 of the Town Law can be read to preclude a town board from delegating special permit powers to a body it creates by ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">More than two years after a child was born, a man began giving the mother a weekly cash payment for the child's support. More than two years after the last payment, the mother filed a paternity action against him. N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 517(a), the statute of limitations, required a paternity action to be instituted within two years of the child's birth, unless paternity had been acknowledged by the father in writing or by furnishing support, or unless the mother was under 18. The family court held that the support payments were an acknowledgement of paternity. On appeal, the putative father argued that he could not be accountable for his acknowledgement because it occurred more than two years after the child's birth. The court explained that the statute could not be tolled after it had expired. However, the court analogized the father's support payments to payments on a debt after the contract limitations period had expired. The acknowledgement of the debt started the running of the limitations period anew. In this case, the mother's failure to file the petition within two years of the last payment meant that the statute had expired. The court reversed and dismissed the petition.</SPAN></P>

The court found that zoning classifications were clothed with a presumption of constitutional legitimacy. The court found that when a zoning regulation was attacked as confiscatory and unconstitutional, it had to be shown that by no permissible interpretation could the regulation as written, or in the instance applied, be justified as a reasonable exercise of the police power. The court found that the property owner had to show more than that the current zoning classification had caused a significant diminution in value, or that a substantially higher value could be obtained if an alternative use was permitted. The court found that the proper test was whether the owner could presently receive a reasonable return on his property, and that to succeed with a constitutional challenge, the owner had to establish that no reasonable return could be had from any permitted use. The court reversed and concluded that the owner had not shown that the ordinance as it presently affected his property was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected plaintiff's contention that the existence of good faith negotiations estopped the interposing of the defense of the two-year contractual time limitation. The court also rejected plaintiff's contention that the contractual statute of limitations was unconstitutional. The court found that the supporting affidavit of plaintiff's attorney was conclusory and virtually devoid of evidentiary facts. The court noted that the mere fact that settlement negotiations were conducted did not warrant an estoppel, and because there was no indication that the insurer and the company intended to settle the matter, or that they had improperly lulled plaintiff into inactivity, they were not estopped from raising the two-year limitation provision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff property owners appealed the judgment of the Supreme Court in Monroe County (New York), which found in favor of defendant developer in the property owners' suit challenging a zoning amendment which permitted the developer to develop a hotel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The developer proposed to operate a hotel on property located in a neighborhood zoned as a medium-high density historic district. Zoning ordinances for the historic district were meant to promote the retention of existing structures but allowed for specially permitted uses. The property had a 112-unit apartment building which had remained vacant since its construction four years earlier. The planning commission and the preservation board recommended denial of the developer's application for a zoning amendment. The city council voted to adopt a zoning amendment allowing hotels in existing structures in the historic district. The property owners sought a declaratory judgment that the amendment was invalid and an injunction preventing the developer from using the property as a hotel. The court found in favor of the developer, holding that the property owners failed to overcome the strong presumption of constitutionality. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the amendment resulted from proper use of the zoning process. The amendment did not amount to spot zoning because it was adopted pursuant to a comprehensive plan which was for the welfare of the community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Spot Zoning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Spot zoning is the singling out of a small parcel of land for a use classification totally different from that of the surrounding area, for the benefit of the owner of the property and to the detriment of other owners; where the enacting authority acts in accordance with a comprehensive plan, it will not be condemned as spot zoning, even though it singles out and affects but one lot or creates a small area in the center of a large zone devoted to a different use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Comprehensive Plan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A comprehensive plan has as its underlying purpose the control of land uses for the benefits of the whole community based upon consideration of its problems and applying the enactment or a general policy to obtain a uniform result not enacted in a haphazard or piecemeal fashion, and in general, if a need is shown to exist for the betterment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the community and an enactment satisfies that need, such change may become part of a comprehensive and well-conceived plan; a determining factor in deciding whether zoning is part of a comprehensive plan is whether forethought has been given to the community's land use problems.  Enactments to change zoning plans should be analyzed in terms of consistency and rationality, with the requirement they not conflict with the fundamental land use policies and development plans of the community, keeping in mind that a comprehensive plan must be flexible and subject to some changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Spot Zoning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. An amendment of a zoning ordinance enacted for the promotion of medium to high density residential neighborhoods within an historic preservation district, which provided for the establishment of hotels in existing structures, is a valid exercise of the zoning power and is not an exercise of &quot;spot zoning&quot;; the facts that property values in the vicinity of a structure proposed to be used as a hotel would change and that the amendment was proposed by individuals with a financial interest in its outcome do not demonstrate how the amendment conflicts with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  an existing comprehensive plan. There was no showing that the amendment, which was adopted in strict terms and with care, granted defendants a discriminatory benefit at the expense and detriment of their neighbors, without public advantage or justification, and since the amendment restricts itself to existing buildings and greatly limits the allowable exterior changes, the historic character of the district will be preserved.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant town sought review of the judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term in Rockland County (New York), which declared Ramapo, N.Y., Local Law No. 3 of 1967 to be invalid and void on the grounds that it was inconsistent with state law and violated the state constitution. Respondent citizens had challenged Local Law No. 3 as the basis for denial of their petition to incorporate a village within the town.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizens, wishing to incorporate as a village within the town's boundaries, filed their petition. The town supervisor determined that the petition did not meet the requirements of Local Law No. 3.

The court reversed, finding that the local law was validly enacted. The court rejected the citizens' argument that the state's Village Law preempted enactment of local laws governing incorporation of villages, finding that preemption was limited to situations in which the intent to occupy an area of legislation was clearly evident. The court found no indication in the state law that it was intended to preclude local laws. The court found further that where local law was not preempted, a local law would be upheld even if it differed from or added to state law so long as it was not inconsistent with state law, and held that Local Law No. 3 was a proper zoning technique, executed for legitimate purposes and a necessary concomitant to the town's authority to determine the lines along which local development would proceed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In this libel action, a preliminary conflict arose regarding interrogatories served by the plaintiff individual police officer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The media entities contended that the individual police officer was not permitted to maintain a libel action because he could not have shown that the relevant editorial comments were &quot;of and concerning&quot; him given the size of the group to which the editorial referred. The media entities also contended that the statements were opinions that were privileged by the new opinion privilege. However, the appellate court rejected the media entities' contentions. Pertaining to the issue of individual application in group defamation, there was no absolute limit on size in New York. The editorial comments were capable of personal application. Also, as to the claim of privilege, accusations of criminal activity, even in the form of opinion, were not constitutionally protected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Westchester County Court (New York), which convicted her of murder in the second degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the second and third degrees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant shot and killed her former lover in his home. She contended that, during a struggle to prevent her from committing suicide, the victim was accidentally shot and killed by a handgun she brought to his residence. The prosecution contended that defendant had entered the victim's home with the intent to kill him because he had recently broken up their 13-year relationship and was involved with another woman. After police arrived at the murder scene, defendant was Mirandized three times before she requested to call her attorney from the residence. During the phone call an officer overheard her say that she thought she had killed the victim. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in failing to suppress this testimony by the officer because it violated her constitutional right to counsel. The court agreed but ruled that in view of the entire record of her trial, there was no harmful error. The court stated that the officer's testimony, evidencing she was surprised by his death, tended to support her contention that she did not intend to kill him. Finally, the court held statutory law did not allow removal of a juror peremptorily after he had already been impaneled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court convicting defendant of murder in the second degree and criminal possession of a weapon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Challenge to Jury</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Under the Criminal Procedure Law, a sworn juror may be challenged only for cause and not peremptorily (see CPL 270.15, 270.20).  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in refusing to exclude a sworn juror from the jury after it became known that the prosecutor had played a role in the dismissal of an indictment against her daughter, since there was no indication in the record that the juror had knowledge of the prosecutor's role in the dismissal of the case so as to make the juror vulnerable to a dismissal for cause.  Moreover, during the course of the trial, defense counsel himself objected to the substitution of an alternate juror so as to permit the subject juror, among others, to comply with previously made travel plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Fair Trial -- Inspection</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> of Premises</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant was not deprived of a fair trial when the court denied her application for an inspection of the premises, such application having been made some 60 days after her arraignment, so as to be not only less than prompt, but actually untimely and subject to summary denial (see CPL 240.80, 255.20, subd 1).  Defendant suffered no prejudice, since there is no indication that defense experts were ever refused access to the residence where the shooting took place; nor is there evidence that any representative of the defense ever made a request to the police or to the District Attorney's office to preserve any particular items of evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Fair Trial -- Rebuttal Testimony</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant was not deprived of a fair trial when the court received testimony in rebuttal from a witness who had overheard a telephone conversation between the victim and the defendant.  The witness' testimony was properly received at this point since it did not tend to establish defendant's intent to kill but rather had a tendency to disprove the alternate state of mind proffered by the defendant at the trial, and was thus offered in denial of an affirmative fact which the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant endeavored to prove.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Fair Trial -- Pretrial Publicity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Defendant was not denied a fair trial by massive pretrial publicity intentionally generated by the prosecution, which allowed the press to gain ready access to the defendant's statements made on the night of the shooting. Pretrial publicity, even if pervasive and concentrated, does not necessarily lead to an unfair trial; here, none of the defendant's statements were suppressed and, therefore, the early access to them enjoyed by the press did not inure to the defendant's prejudice.  Moreover, defense counsel himself participated in much of the media coverage of the case, and made no requests for a change of venue or a postponement of trial to permit public attention to subside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Argument and Conduct of Counsel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The prosecutor's cross-examination of the defendant was not unfair, compelling defendant to characterize certain of the People's witnesses as liars and injecting prejudicial references to defendant's social standing.  It was defendant herself who made such accusations and initiated the offending colloquy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Fair Trial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Defendant was not deprived&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of a fair trial by the prosecutor's telephone call to an expert witness who had been retained by the defense, which call did not amount to an unconstitutional invasion of the councils of the defense; such conversations are permissible so long as the prosecutor does not suggest or imply that the witness is in any way obligated to converse with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Argument and Conduct of Counsel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The prosecutor's summation, wherein he attempted to discredit the defendant's firsthand account of the facts and suggested a different scenario based upon what he saw to be fair inferences to be drawn from evidence presented, did not exceed the bounds of proper advocacy; moreover, the jurors were repeatedly reminded that it was their recollection, rather than that of counsel, that was to control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Argument and Conduct of Counsel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The prosecutor's reference to a wound in the victim's posterior shoulder as a &quot;shot in the back&quot; did not prejudice defendant, since there was never any real dispute over the location of the wounds and the bullet did in fact travel slightly from back to front.</SPAN></P>

In any event, even though the jurors apparently followed counsel's advice and attempted to re-enact the shooting during their deliberations in accordance with their own recollection of the testimony, there was no evidence of juror misconduct, such conduct constituting nothing more than an application of everyday perceptions and common sense to the issues presented in the trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The court did not err in refusing to charge that a defendant can have two homes within the meaning of the weapons possession statute.  The charge on the question of defendant's home did not state or imply that she could have only one home or request the jury to determine which of either of the two residences in question was defendant's home; moreover, the evidence clearly demonstrated that the victim's residence was not defendant's home within the meaning of the statute.  Furthermore, any argument that the court's charge on the meaning of &quot;home&quot; was erroneous, inadequate or incomplete was not preserved for review.</SPAN></P>

Once the right to counsel has attached, no statement which a suspect directs to his attorney may be reported at trial by a police officer, regardless of whether he intentionally or inadvertently overheard it.  Nevertheless, the admission of the statement, although error, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, since it neither indicates nor suggests an intent to kill on the part of the defendant, but rather suggests the contrary since it reflects her surprise at the victim's condition and her uncertainty with respect to her responsibility for that condition.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, Conciliation and Appeals Board (CAB) as well as a landlord, sought review of a judgment from the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which granted respondent tenants' petitions for renewal leases on rent stabilized terms. The tenants cross-appealed from the denial of their application for an award of reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses to be paid by the landlord.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landlord operated a church and also owned and operated 60 residential apartments, two of which were occupied by the tenants. When each tenant commenced occupancy her apartment had become vacancy decontrolled. Upon the expiration of the term of each tenant's lease, renewal was granted upon increased rental. After successive renewals and increases, the tenants complained to the CAB of being charged excessive rents. The CAB upheld the landlord's contention that it was exempt from regulation by virtue of the ownership of the properties by a religious institution operated exclusively for charitable purposes on a nonprofit basis. The trial court annulled the determination and appellants sought review. The court held that the intent of the legislature appeared to provide exceptions to the rent stabilization laws for charitable or educational institutions. The court determined that CAB had a solid basis in reason for its determination. The court held that the claim for attorneys' fees, made pursuant to N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 234, was properly denied. The landlord's refusal to offer the tenants renewal leases on rent stabilized terms was not a failure to perform a covenant or agreement.</SPAN></P>

The court held that in the context of the statute, the term aqueduct referred to the entire system of volume and pressure regulated delivery of water, including the system of collecting and pumping the water from its sources to its destination in the city.

When benefits were discontinued she sought the services of a highly regarded local trial attorney. Aware of N.Y. Workers' Comp.

When the board indicated that the arrangement was illegal, the retainer was returned. The worker then sued for a judgment declaring the statute unconstitutional and enjoining its enforcement. She argued that it violated her right to privacy, her freedom to contract, and her right to equal protection. The board's motion for summary judgment was granted. The court affirmed. The worker's right to privacy was unaffected. The right to contract was not absolute. Abridging the right to freely contract with attorneys was within the reach of the state's police power.

C.P.L.R. art. 78 petition as to petitioner county judge. The county judge sought to review the actions of the administrative judge by which he was assigned to preside in other counties to alleviate a backlog of cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The administrative judge assigned the county judge to two terms of court outside his district as part of a larger transfer scheme to relieve calendar congestion. The county judge contended that his transfer was arbitrary and capricious because of the personal inconvenience it occasioned him and because of the disparity between his salary and that of similar judges in the counties to which he was assigned. The administrative judge unsuccessfully sought to dismiss the county judge's petition. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that the county judge's petition failed to state grounds for relief based upon arbitrary or capricious administrative action. The court noted that prior to the unification of the court system, the salaries of county court judges were largely determined by the respective county legislatures. Although the disparities were rectified, the change had not taken place when the county judge was reassigned. The court concluded that due to the urgency surrounding the judicial backlog, the temporary continuation of salary disparity did not constitute a violation of the county judge's constitutional rights entitling him to retroactive pay of the difference.</SPAN></P>

The terms of the contracts for the expenditure of the tax receipts were solely within the discretion of the county legislature.

An ambulance district was an improvement district that was only a special administrative area and not a municipal corporation. The town board made findings of fact that certain areas of the town did not have an adequate quantity of ambulance service available to them. The town acted pursuant to its enabling legislation.

The court concluded that there was clear and convincing evidence that the mother was unable to properly care for the child and would be unable to do so in the foreseeable future.</SPAN></P>

The acting director revoked the licenses. The licensees asserted that: revocation was precluded by the licensees' receipt of certificates of relief from disabilities and forfeitures, the acting director was not authorized to act in the commissioner's stead, and the licensees were subjected to an ex post facto law or deprived of their property without compensation. The court affirmed the revocation and determined that: (1) the receipt of certificates of relief from disabilities and forfeitures did not exempt them from a license revocation; (2) the acting director had the full authority of the commissioner; and (3) the loss of their property, if any, was the result of the license revocation which, itself, was not invalid as an application of an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs appealed from an order denying their motion for a preliminary injunction pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 6301, in a declaratory judgment action in which they attack the constitutionality of Niagara Town, N.Y., Local Law No. 8. Defendant cross-appealed from the denial of its motion for a preliminary injunction to compel compliance with Local Law No. 8 and from the court's dismissal pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3211(a)(4) of its counterclaim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs operated waste disposal facilities and were applying for additional permits to expand the facilities. After substantially completing the application process, including complying with the state environmental regulations, defendant town enacted Niagara Town, N.Y., Local Law No. 8. This law essentially established a complex regulatory mechanism under which the town board was given authority to grant or deny permits for facilities within the town for waste disposal and management operations. Plaintiff sought a preliminary injunction and declaratory judgment to keep the law from being applied to them. The court found that plaintiff might be able to show that, in view of the extensive protection already provided by state law and regulations, the town law so little benefited the public welfare that the imposition on plaintiffs of the burdens of compliance therewith could not be justified. Thus, the preliminary injunction was improperly denied. Further, the court concluded that the lower court properly rejected the argument that the local law was not beyond the authority of the town board to enact, and that it did not impose an undue burden on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A city ordinance required all movie theatre operators to file a certificate of registration. Failure to register would result in revocation of all other licenses issued to the business. An anonymous plaintiff commenced a declaratory judgment action seeking to have the ordinance declared unconstitutional. The court below granted the request, finding that the ordinance violated plaintiff's rights to be free from compelled disclosure, guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. On appeal by defendant city the court reversed, holding that only when disclosure requirements were directed at a group inherently suspected of criminal activities would they be deemed to entail a substantial risk of self-incrimination. Theatre operators were not such a group. The court found that the ordinance was regulatory in nature, and it was not an unreasonable exercise of the police power for a city to desire the names and addresses of those operating businesses within its boundaries. Nor had the city singled out movie operators, as it had similar disclosure requirements applicable to various other businesses.

The trial court dismissed the bank's suit with leave to file a claim in the court of claims and dismissed the remaining suits. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the suits, whatever the variations in relief requested, were essentially suits to recover money from the state and as such were required to be brought in the court of claims. The court further found that even those actions which sought declaratory relief, in addition to or as an alternative to money damages, clearly did not present a genuine issue justifying the exercise of ancillary jurisdiction, in view of the obvious circumstance that the question raised had been definitively answered and was no longer a question requiring declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Broome County Court (New York), which convicted defendant of three counts of first-degree sodomy. Defendant argued it was legal error to introduce into evidence uncharged crimes on the issue of defendant's identity as perpetrator, and to admit testimony of a police officer regarding a witness's identification. Defendant also argued the People failed to prove forcible compulsion beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was tried on various charges of sodomy. Defendant moved for a dismissal, alleging the People failed to prove forcible compulsion. The lower court denied defendant's motion, and entered a judgment of conviction against defendant. The appellate court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court found that the victim testified that after he initially refused to engage in consensual sodomy, defendant put an arm around his neck so that it was almost choking victim, and thus holding him, pushed him along a pathway under a bridge. The victim did not describe the manner of restraint under the bridge, and testified that he made no effort at resistance and did not attempt to leave until after defendant left. The court held that defendant's application of superior force at the outset of the encounter was sufficient to support the inference of an implicit threat of serious physical injury if complainant did not submit to the deviate intercourse. The court therefore found that the People proved forcible compulsion, as defined in N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 130.00(8). The court also held that evidence of certain uncharged crimes, and testimony of police identification, was admissible.</SPAN></P>

Further, defendant has not established any unconstitutionality of the statutory definition of forcible compulsion, i.e., that force which is capable of overcoming &quot;resistance of a type reasonably to be expected from a person who genuinely refuses&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to participate&quot;; the statutory requirements do not create any unreasonable ambiguity as a standard of conduct. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested as a result of the undercover activities of an informer. The informer allowed police officers to enter defendant's apartment. The apartment was searched and cocaine was found, along with money that had been marked by the police. To determine if the police complied with N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 140.15(4), the police had the burden of proving that they had a reasonable belief that a crime had just been committed in the apartment to justify their entry without a warrant. The court held that: (1) the precedent of recent case law was prospective and not applicable; (2) the facts showed probable cause to enter defendant's apartment but a general search of the apartment without a warrant was not lawful because once defendant was arrested, there was no further danger that evidence would have been lost or destroyed; (3) exigent circumstances were not shown; (4) denial of defendant's motion to suppress may have contributed to his pleading guilty so the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress was not harmless; and (5) the evidence seized in the apartment, except for that taken from defendant's person and from his immediate vicinity, had to be suppressed.</SPAN></P>

The system fails to further the asserted State interest of preserving local control over education in these districts.  It also fails because there are methods of financing public school education which would further local control over education with less intrusion upon the right of education guaranteed to all children of the State.  Accordingly, New York's public school finance system violates the equal protection clause of the New York State Constitution (art I, &sect; 11)&quot;; (2) by deleting from the penultimate sentence of decretal paragraph 1(c) the words &quot;and irrational&quot;; and (3) by deleting from the final sentences of decretal paragraphs 1(c), 1(d) and 1(e) the words &quot;and of the Federal Constitution (the Fourteenth Amendment)&quot; and substituting the following declaration: &quot;New York's school financing system is constitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.&quot; As so modified, judgment affirmed, without costs or disbursements.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant school districts appealed a judgment of the Supreme Court in Nassau County (New York), which concluded that the school finance system violated the equal protection and education clauses of the state constitution and the federal equal protection clause. The trial court found constitutional the use of local districts and reliance on local taxation and permitted the system to continue until changes were made or an injunction issued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court agreed that New York method of financing public education was constitutionally defective. The court applied intermediate scrutiny to the system of education finance. The wealth-based system severely constrained the ability of local education to provide the educational offerings they deemed suitable for their pupils. The court departed from the trial court's determination that the Fourteenth Amendment was transgressed. The court held the palpable proof of clearly lesser educational opportunity based on wealth discrimination established violation of the equal protection provision of the state constitution. The court held that a judicial remedy to the unconstitutionality of the system could be fashioned. In the face of evidence demonstrating that large numbers of children emerged from the school system lacking even the minimal tools necessary to function in society and that the current financing scheme was in good measure a cause for the failures, the court concluded that the education article was violated by a method of financing which failed to establish a school system capable of providing an education for many educable children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the lower court's judgment by substituting language that the system impinged upon the constitutionally guaranteed right of education and failed to further the state interest of preserving local control over school districts. The court also modified the language of the order to reflect its holding that the Fourteenth Amendment was not violated. The court affirmed the modified judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, the state superintendent of banks and others, sought review of a decision of the Supreme Court, Queens County (New York), which granted a motion for summary judgment by plaintiff, a former director of a savings and loan association, who alleged that N.Y. Banking Law &sect; 397(2)(b)(3) was unconstitutional in that it violated his equal protection and due process rights and sought reinstatement as a director.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The former director was married to the niece of a director of the association and was himself a director until he was removed pursuant to a directive issued by the State of New York Banking Department on the ground that his election as a director of violated N.Y. Banking Law &sect; 397(2)(b)(3), which made individuals related to a director of a savings and loan association ineligible to become directors themselves. He claimed that the provision was unconstitutional. The trial court ordered his reinstatement. Because the question was likely to recur even though the association had become a federally chartered institution, the court ruled that the provision was constitutional. Elimination of nepotism was a legitimate state purpose; the statute was not overbroad. A suspect classification was not involved and the classification at issue did not interfere with the right to marry or an individual's ability to carry on a profession. States had wide latitude in regulating their local economies under their police powers, and rational distinctions could be made with less than mathematical exactitude. The provision had a rational basis and was a valid exercise of the state's police power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision, denied the former director's summary judgment motion, granted defendants' cross motion for summary judgment, and declared that the statute at issue was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to the ETPA, the village passed a resolution declaring a housing emergency. The county board established guidelines for fair-market rents for all apartments in the village subject to the ETPA. Thirteen tenants applied for and received adjustments of their initial legal regulated rents from the state agency. The landlords brought an action against the state agency to vacate the orders and for a declaratory judgment that &sect; 9(b) of the ETPA and N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 9, &sect; 2502.3 were unconstitutional. The trial court remanded for a hearing and upheld the constitutionality of the statute. On appeal, the court modified to strike the direction to remand for a hearing and otherwise affirmed. The state agency correctly applied the formula set forth in the ETPA for the determination of fair-market rents and refunds. No provision was made in the statute for a hearing such as requested by the landlords. Even assuming the ETPA impaired contracts, it was a valid exercise of police power that provided a reasonable alternative for the protection and general welfare of citizens under a declared housing emergency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant home challenged the order from the Family Court, New York County (New York), dismissing its petition to terminate respondent parent's parental rights and finding N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In separate actions, the parents challenged the constitutionality of N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 348-b, as it allowed for the termination of parental rights for mentally ill parents. The court rejected the parents' challenge. Section 384-b did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because it reasonably promoted the substantial state interest in the welfare of children, did not facially distinguish between mentally ill parents and all other parents, and fairly balanced the parties' interests. By focusing on conduct rather than status, &sect; 384-b had not created an irrefutable presumption of parental incapacity for mental ill parents to care for their children. The parents' unconstitutional vagueness challenge failed because &sect;348-b was sufficiently elastic to protect parental rights, but not so indefinite as to deprive parents of fair notice of the behavior affected. Section 384-b did not penalize status rather than conduct for purposes of substantive due process because it provided for a hearing, not automatic termination. The court held that substantial evidence supported the denial of parental rights to both parents.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent and Child -- Termination of Parental Rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The provisions of section 384-b (subd 4, par [c]; subd 6, par [a]) of the Social Services Law, insofar as they deal with mental illness and the termination of parental rights, are constitutional.  The statute (1) does not violate equal protection by treating mentally ill parents differently from other parents since the distinction is neither arbitrary nor invidious, but rather balances the interests of the parents, the children and the State by requiring a clear and convincing quantum of proof that the parent's mental illness precludes him from properly caring for his child; (2) does not violate procedural due process by running the risk of erroneously depriving a parent of his child inasmuch as it has a high standard of proof and an exacting test which must be met if parental rights are to be terminated; (3) is not unconstitutionally vague since&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it is not so indefinite as to deprive parents of fair notice of the behavior affected; and (4) does not violate substantive due process by penalizing status rather than conduct, inasmuch as it does not penalize a parent for being mentally ill, but rather terminates a mentally ill parent's parental rights only when the illness renders the parent unable to provide a child with the minimum requirements of care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent and Child -- Termination of Parental Rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The parental rights of a mother should be terminated where there is clear and convincing proof of mental illness which renders her unable to provide adequate supervision and guidance to her children for the foreseeable future. (Social Services Law, &sect; 384-b, subd 4, par [c]; subd 6, par [a].)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent and Child -- Termination of Parental Rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The parental rights of a father should be terminated where there is clear and convincing proof that he is presently and for the foreseeable future unable, by reason of mental illness, to provide adequate and proper care for his children.  (Social Services Law, &sect; 384-b, subd 4, par [c]; subd 6, par [a].)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In order to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  establish standing, a party must demonstrate that he is possessed of rights which the statute infringes, and that he is within the class of persons affected by the statute; accordingly, a natural mother has standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute where it appears that her right to raise her children is infringed by the statute, and that, as a mentally ill parent, she is within the class of persons affected by the statute.  Furthermore, a natural father has standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute where he had raised that issue during a fact-finding hearing to terminate his parental rights based on mental illness, notwithstanding that the petition against him was dismissed for insufficient proof, since the constitutional issue will be important if there is a successful challenge to the finding of insufficient proof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent and Child -- Termination of Parental Rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The right of a parent to raise his child is one which enjoys strong constitutional protection; furthermore, the termination of parental rights is one of the most severe forms of deprivation that can be imposed upon a parent, and only the most countervailing interests can&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  outweigh the rights abridged by termination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection of Laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In order to ascertain whether a law violates equal protection standards, a court must examine the character of the classification, the individual interests affected, and the governmental interest involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Due Process of Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Procedural due process is applied flexibly and calls for procedures appropriate to the situation; a court must examine the private interests affected, the risk of erroneous deprivation and the probable value of additional safeguards, and the governmental interest involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. In order to avoid a finding of vagueness, a statute must provide fair notice of the proscribed behavior, set clear enough standards so that the statute will not be enforced in a subjective or arbitrary way, and not be so overbroad as to result in an inhibition of constitutionally protected activity.  </SPAN></P>

The court affirmed on both counts. The court held that judicial review was permissible before the applicants exhausted their administrative remedies because the hearing officer would have been required to follow the challenged directive and the delay would have caused irreparable harm to the children.

Banking Law &sect; 673 and conspiracy in the third degree under former N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 105.05, and imposed various monetary fines. The bank officers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence at trial established the bank officers used the bank's assets, in a systematic way, for other than corporate purposes or proper and legitimate investment. The bank officers, however, did not profit directly from any of the illegal transactions.  N.Y. Banking Law &sect; 673 made it a felony for a bank officer to willfully misapply any of the bank's funds, property or its credit. The court affirmed the judgment on the ground that it was a violation of &sect; 673 for a bank officer to use a bank's assets for other than proper purposes even though the officer had not intention of defrauding anyone. The court found that (1) the evidence was more than sufficient to sustain the verdict convicting the bank officers of the various counts alleging a violation of &sect; 673; and (2) the officers' actions were motivated by a desire to accommodate the needs of the bank's new owner, a purpose which surely concerned their private interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trustees of a savings institution were approaching age 75 when they filed separate actions for a declaration that &sect; 246(1)(c)(ii) was unconstitutional. The trial court granted the trustees' summary judgment. In a single decision, the trial court held that the challenged statute was unconstitutional upon finding that it discriminated against those over 75 years old and had no substantial and rational relation to a legitimate and compelling state interest. The Superintendent was enjoined from enforcing the invalidated provision. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found it most significant that the savings institution had adopted a by-law establishing 75 as the mandatory retirement age for its trustees, and yet it had not been made a party to the actions. The trustees stated that they did not challenge the subject by-law, and there was nothing in the record that indicated that the by-law would have been repealed if the statute in question were declared unconstitutional. No justiciable controversy existed upon which the court could have properly ruled because, even if the court sustained the invalidation of the statute, no benefit would have accrued to the trustees.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers argued that the commission's determination was unconstitutional in that an arbitrary or discriminatory classification had been made between residents and the taxpayers, who had changed their status to non-residents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to moving out of state the taxpayers sold real property in New York and realized a long-term capital gain. The sales were made on an installment basis and the taxpayers reported the gain and paid the tax due thereon each year as they received the installment payments. In January 1972 the as yet unreported taxable gain was $ 96,648. In their 1972 returns they included that portion of the sales price of the property received by them. The taxable gain received in 1973 was also timely reported. The income tax bureau found that the capital gain could not be reported on an installment basis, as the taxpayers did not comply with N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 654(c)(4). A notice of deficiency for 1972 was issued. The commission found that the unreported taxable gain of $ 96,648 had accrued in 1972 and was fully taxable then and that the interest income acquired in 1973, which was derived from the property's sale, was includible in the taxpayers' adjusted gross income. On appeal, the court affirmed, noting the taxpayers were obligated to file a bond before changing their status to nonresident under &sect; 654(c)(4).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The People of the State of New York appealed from an order of the Supreme Court in Queens County (New York), which granted a motion by defendant to suppress certain physical evidence and oral statements.</SPAN></P>

The individual made a call, left, and returned to the apartment with drugs. One of the two names listed for the apartment where the call was made was defendant's. The same undercover officer later contacted the individual, and a similar transaction took place. The individual was arrested. The police then went to arrest the person in the apartment where the individual obtained the drugs. After knocking on the door, defendant opened the door, and the officers secured defendant and a woman. Defendant stated he would show them where the drugs were and led the officers to a room where they seized bags containing a white powder, and then they searched the apartment. Following his indictment on drug charges, defendant's motion to suppress his statement and all physical evidence on the grounds that the search was without probable cause, consent, warrant, or other justification was granted. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the entry and seizure of the individuals were illegal and that, thus, defendant's statements and the physical evidence were properly suppressed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Arrest -- Warrantless Arrest in Felony Suspect's Home</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A decision of the United States Supreme Court holding that the warrantless entry of a felony suspect's home for the purpose of arresting him is unconstitutional in the absence of exigent circumstances (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Payton v New York</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 445 U.S. 537) is not retroactive since the rationale for the new constitutional doctrine is not founded upon considerations of overcoming an &quot;aspect of the criminal trial that substantially impairs its truth-finding function &quot;.  Accordingly, the legality of defendant's warrantless arrest in his apartment by police who suspected that he was a &quot;connection&quot; in a drug case must be determined under the prior standard ( CPL 140.15) which permitted the warrantless arrest of a felony suspect in his home upon an unembellished showing of &quot;reasonable cause&quot; to believe that the individual&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sought has committed a crime with the reasonableness of the police conduct to be measured by the facts and inferences within police knowledge at the time they crossed the threshold of defendant's apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Arrest -- Warrantless Arrest in Felony Suspect's Home -- Probable Cause</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Probable cause to make an arrest, which requires far less proof than is required for conviction, is that quantum of evidence which would warrant a person of reasonable caution in believing that the suspect had committed or was committing an offense; the probable cause standard requires probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed, as well as probable cause to believe that the individual to be arrested committed it; accordingly, since the police, when they entered defendant's apartment without a warrant and seized him after following a suspect in a cocaine sale to what they believed to be the suspect's supplier, only knew that the suspect had made a phone call to someone in defendant's apartment prior to the drug sale and had entered defendant's apartment with marked money and departed without it, they lacked concrete facts which could elevate the suspicion that an individual&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in defendant's apartment was the suspect's &quot;connection&quot; to the probable cause necessary for the ensuing arrest and, therefore, the entry and seizure of the individuals in defendant's apartment were illegal and defendant's statements and the physical evidence seized must be suppressed. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon defendants' separate convictions stemming from a murder, defendants appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not err when it failed to charge that a state's witness was an accomplice to the crime. Even if the witness was an accomplice, her testimony was sufficiently corroborated by other witnesses. Although defendants' cases were delayed over 21 months prior to going to trial, the court found that none of defendants' speedy trial rights had been violated. Because much of the delay was due to defendants' pretrial motions and the failure of the state to locate an essential witness, the court found that the delay was not unconstitutional. Nor did the delay violate the speedy trial rights provided by N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 30.20 and N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 12.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dispute involved Medicaid reimbursement rates for the year 1976. The hospital contended that the 1976 rates were improperly calculated and unreasonably related to its costs. The hospital filed a declaratory judgment action against the Commissioner, seeking a determination that the 1976 rates were illegal. The hospital also sought a directive ordering that the rates be recomputed. The trial court denied the Commissioner's motion to dismiss the complaint. On appeal, the court noted that while the action was pending, a state regulation was promulgated that established a procedure for reviewing a certified rate by providing for a hearing before a rate review officer. Because the case was a pending administrative proceeding at the time the amendment of the regulation was made, the intervening regulation was to be applied. Accordingly, the court held that before the hospital could seek judicial review, it was required to pursue the administrative remedy provided for in the amended regulation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a recipient of public assistance under the Aid For Dependent Children Program, was convicted after a jury trial of welfare fraud for failure to disclose a pay increase and the receipt of unemployment benefits during a temporary lay-off period. Defendant appealed, alleging a jury instruction on the application of the presumption of guilt pursuant to N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 145 deprived her of a fair trial. Upon review, the court agreed, reversed the conviction and ordered a new trial. It noted that the statutory presumption was a permissive rebuttable presumption that the jury could, but was not mandated to, rely upon; therefore, the statute was constitutionally sound. However, the jury was not told that the presumption was permissive, that they had a choice as to whether or not to apply it and, if the presumption were given effect, that it could be rebutted. Accordingly, the instruction had the effect of impermissibly shifting the burden of proof to defendant, which deprived her of a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant state sought review from so much of an order of the Supreme Court in Queens County (New York) as, upon granting reargument, adhered to its original decision dismissing the first counts of the indictments charging defendants with murder in the first degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were charged with the crimes of murder in the first degree, murder in the second degree (felony murder), robbery in the first degree (three counts), attempted robbery in the first degree (three counts) and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree. Defendants challenged the first counts of the respective indictments charging them with murder in the first degree under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.27, on constitutional grounds. The court found N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.27 was inextricably bound to the death penalty, under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 60.06, as its exclusive form of punishment, so that the one could not exist without the other. Thus, because the state death penalty statute was unconstitutional, the first count in each indictment was dismissed. On appeal by the state, the court found that the lower court had correctly granted leave to the state to resubmit to another grand jury for possible consideration of murder in the second degree. Accordingly, the orders insofar as appealed from, were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Inasmuch as section 125.27 of the Penal Law, as it may provide a substantive basis for murder in the first degree, is so inextricably bound to the death penalty, under section 60.06 of the Penal Law, the former is burdened with the same constitutional infirmity as renders the latter invalid. </SPAN></P>

The teacher argued that the Commissioner lacked jurisdiction to consider the board's appeal because the board failed to comply with certain conditions precedent. The court found that there was nothing in N.Y. Educ. Law, &sect; 3020-a (5) that conditioned the right to appeal on compliance with N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3020-a (4). The teacher did not show any prejudice to her from the board's action. The penalty imposed was not so arbitrary as to be unconstitutional, nor was it shocking to one's sense of fairness.

Throughout the period in question, the corporation did business in New York, but the DISC did not. When the corporation filed its New York franchise tax returns, it did not include any portion of the DISC's accumulated income in its net income. The Commission, relying on &sect; 208(9)(i)(B), maintained that in arriving at its franchise tax, the corporation should have combined all of the DISC's income and expenses with its own. In annulling the Commission's determination, the court ruled that to the extent &sect; 208(9)(i)(B) required the DISC's accumulated income be added to the corporation's income, it was unconstitutional because it placed an impermissible burden on foreign commerce. The essential purpose behind enactment of the DISC provisions was to encourage exportation to foreign countries of American-made products so as to alleviate a burgeoning trade deficit.

The firemen took voluntary retirement at age 62 and were removed from the city payroll. Their benefits under &sect; 207-a were terminated. They filed an application for reinstatement to the payroll and asserted that they had not been permitted to withdraw their election when the courts ultimately declared, in a prior action, that amended &sect; 207-a was constitutional, because they had already reached the age of 62 and elected to receive retirement benefits. The trial court dismissed their petition and they challenged the decision. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that they had the opportunity to withdraw their election at the time the statute was amended. The determination by the courts that the statute was constitutional did not give them a second opportunity to elect to remain on the payroll.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed petitioners' petition, with prejudice, on the grounds that it failed to state a legally cognizable cause of action and that the local law was neither unconstitutional nor subject to a referendum on petition.

The Department adopted the findings and conclusions of the hearing examiner, and held that the nursing home could not be made reasonable safe or functionally adequate for nursing home occupancy. On appeal, the court confirmed and held that: (1) N.Y. Comp.

The trial court found that defendant was not a predicate felon and that the revised predicate felon statutes were unconstitutional. The court affirmed rejecting the constitutional argument and holding that the only reason that defendant face predicate felon status was because of a legislative oversight in amending the drug laws by providing for resentencing of those convicted of class A felonies for methadone crimes to lesson the harshness of the mandatory life sentences persons faced for possession small quantities of methadone but failing to provide for the resentencing of persons convicted of lesser degrees of the crime.

The court found that the action was inappropriate for a class action because it involved government operations and because subsequent petitioners would be adequately protected under the principles of stare decisis. The court rejected the employees' state constitutional argument, finding that nothing in the application of the statute would affect the employees' benefits. The court found that the contractual relationship was conditioned upon the retirement system maintaining noncontributory status.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1974 plaintiff driver and defendant driver, residents of different states, were involved in a car accident. In 1980 while the present case was still ongoing the United States Supreme Court held that in determining whether a particular exercise of state-court jurisdiction was consistent with due process, the inquiry must focus on the relationship among defendant, the forum, and the litigation. The fact that defendant's insurer chose to do business in the forum state could not form the basis for a finding that defendant engaged in any purposeful activity related to the forum that would make the exercise of jurisdiction fair, just, or reasonable. The court held that although this decision would appear to allow a grant of defendant's motion to dismiss, which was denied by the trial court, defendant had only challenged personal jurisdiction in his answer. Having failed to object to quasi in rem jurisdiction by pre-answer motion or in his answer, defendant waived it. In the face of plaintiff's good faith reliance on the clear language of the cases preceding this decision, she was entitled to protection against amendment of defendant's answer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayers and appellee Board of Assessors of the County of Nassau sought review of the decision of the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellants and declared parts of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayers challenged the application of retrospective laws to determine how they could prove discriminatory taxation. The court affirmed the order granting summary judgment for appellants. The court held that N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 307 retrospectively sanctioned a real property tax on property by class or type. The court held that a statutory discrimination between two like classes could not be rationalized by assigning them different labels. The court held that the tax scheme was unconstitutional because &sect; 721 extended benefits to certain owners. The court held that the unconstitutionality of &sect; 720(3) was not established because taxpayers had an alternative, non-prohibitive method of proving that they were saddled with an unfair tax burden. However, the court held that &sect; 720(3) could not constitutionally be applied to appellants because they had obtained an interlocutory judgment prior to enactment of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The special term court dismissed the petition concluding that the use being made of the premises was not a use permitted by the ordinance. The church appealed.

The estate had prevailed in a declaratory judgment suit filed pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 after the member died while on a leave of absence due to illness.</SPAN></P>

STRS denied an application for a death benefit based on a finding that she did not meet the requirements of N.Y. Retire. &amp; Soc. Sec. Law art. 11. Her estate then sought a declaratory judgment that the death benefit was payable or, alternatively, that the statute was unconstitutional. Treating the case as a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, the supreme court ordered STRS to pay the benefit. STRS appealed but the court affirmed. It rejected the STRS's interpretation of the governing requirement under Tier II that the member was not &quot;in service&quot; at the time of her death because she was on unpaid leave. It held that the STRS's &quot;selective application&quot; of the definition of &quot;service&quot; in N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 501(19) to Tier II members such as the decedent was unreasonable. It also rejected the STRS's claim that its position was consistent with N.Y. Retire. &amp; Soc. Sec.

The court cited a previous case in which a defendant was found guilty of second degree robbery where he threatened his victim with a real but inoperable gun.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner restaurant sought review pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 of respondent liquor authority's suspension of the restaurant's liquor license pursuant to N.Y. Comp. Code R. &amp; Regs. tit. 9, &sect; 53.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The restaurant challenged the liquor authority's suspension of its liquor license, urging that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the finding that the nude dancers' performance was lewd and indecent. The restaurant argued that the regulations prohibiting nude dancing were unconstitutional. The court observed that insofar as the restaurant challenged the constitutionality of the regulations, the action was converted into a declaratory judgment. The court first found that the record contained substantial evidence to support the liquor authority's conclusion that the premises became disorderly by reason of an indecent and lewd performance. The court next concluded that the prohibition against topless dancing in licensed premises contained in N.Y. Comp. Code R. &amp; Regs. tit. 9, &sect; 53.1(s) was unconstitutional. The court found that the absolute prohibition against the presentation of obscene topless dancing contained in N.Y. Comp. Code R. &amp; Regs. tit. 9, &sect; 53.1(r)(2) was not unconstitutional because it represented nothing more than a State's continuing and legitimate effort to accomplish the goal of prohibiting performances that partook more of gross sexuality than communication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court annulled the liquor authority's finding that the restaurant violated a prohibition against topless dancing and declared that portion of the regulation to be unconstitutional. The court declared the prohibition against lewd and indecent nude dancing to be constitutional and sustained the liquor authority's finding that the restaurant's premises became disorderly by reason of such conduct, and remanded for the penalty determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a consolidated proceeding pursuant to the New York Real Property Tax Law to review assessments on petitioner taxpayer's real property for the assessment years 1962 through 1976, the Supreme Court, Westchester County (New York) denied a post-trial motion for relief filed by respondents, a city, its assessor, and its board of review. Respondents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondents had filed a post-trial motion for an order relieving them from a written stipulation as to equalization ratios for certain assessment years, and a further order determining that certain classified rates for the city were applicable for those years. The court upheld the trial court's order denying respondents' motion. The court held that the stipulation should not be vacated in part because of the extreme prejudice to the taxpayer. In particular, the taxpayer had given up much in consideration for the stipulation. The taxpayer had commissioned an annual sales study by random sample selection. That study, which took several years, was completed for most of the years at issue at an actual cost to the taxpayer in excess of $ 15,000. The study indicated a ratio to full value approximately 5 to 10 points below the corresponding state rate. In reliance upon the stipulation, the taxpayer discontinued its annual sales study for the remaining years, absorbed the financial loss in trial preparation cost for the study already completed, and withdrew its proposed order to compel selection of parcels. It would be practically impossible to continue the annual sales study.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from an order of the Supreme Court, Kings County (New York), which entered judgment of his conviction for criminal possession of stolen property in the first degree and which denied his motion that the trial court declare a mistrial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who was black, was convicted of criminal possession of stolen property in the first degree by an all white jury because the prosecutor had used his peremptory challenges to exclude all black prospective jurors from the jury. Defendant's motion for a mistrial was denied and the trial court did not inquire into the prosecutor's reason for using his peremptory challenges in that fashion. Defendant appealed and contended that he had been deprived of the right to be tried by an impartial jury. Upon review the court reversed the judgment and ordered a new trial. The court held that from all the circumstances, including the prosecutor's use against black jurors, of all of his many peremptory challenges, defendant's race, and the trial judge's perceptions of both the characteristics of the prospective jurors who were challenged peremptorily and the conduct of the prosecutor, there was a substantial likelihood that the challenges in question were based solely on race, and thus the trial court erred when it failed to inquire into the prosecutor's reasons for the exercise of his peremptory challenges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court which convicted defendant of criminal possession of stolen property in the first degree. The court ordered a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A peremptory challenge may not be employed to exclude a prospective petit juror solely because of his race (NY Const, art I, &sect; 1) and, where defendant can establish a substantial likelihood that peremptory challenges are being exercised by the prosecutor to eliminate potential petit jurors on that ground alone, the initial presumption that the prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges is constitutionally proper is rebutted, shifting the burden to the prosecutor to show, in response to inquiry by the trial court, that the peremptory challenges in question were not exercised solely on the basis of the prospective juror's race; however, the exclusion of a significant number of black potential jurors is not sufficient, in and of itself, to warrant reversal of a trial court's determination not to make inquiry.  Accordingly, the right&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of defendant, who is black, to a trial by an impartial jury, as defined by the New York Constitution (art I, &sect; 1), was violated when his timely motion for a mistrial, based on the prosecutor's alleged misuse of all of the substantial number of peremptory challenges exercised by him to exclude blacks from the jury, was denied without an inquiry by the trial court into the prosecutor's reasons therefor, although, considering all of the circumstances, there was a substantial likelihood that it was done solely on the basis of race of the challenged jurors; defendant's conviction must be reversed without regard to the quantum or quality of the proof of his guilt.  </SPAN></P>
