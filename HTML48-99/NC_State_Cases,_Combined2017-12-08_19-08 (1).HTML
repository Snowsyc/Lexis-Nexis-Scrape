<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Ervin, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, April, 1969 Schedule C Session, Mecklenburg Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon proper petition, at the request of both parties, and because of the constitutional and procedural questions involved, this Court ordered the appeal docketed here without prior review by the North Carolina Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the trial, a jury was waived.  The parties entered into the following stipulation of facts:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Plaintiff, acting as his own counsel, and Henry W. Underhill, Jr., Counsel of Record for the defendants, being of the opinion that the resolution of this controversy depends upon questions of law and having heretofore waived a jury trial in the cause and consented that the court may hear and resolve said matters upon an agreed STATEMENT OF FACTS, stipulate and agree as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">1. That the plaintiff is the owner of a wood frame dwelling house located on the corner of West Summit Avenue and South Church Street in the City of Charlotte and that said dwelling is listed as 1449 South Church Street and was used by the plaintiff in connection with his business as a Minister and as an attorney at law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">2. That plaintiff's dwelling, from time to time prior&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  to the present controversy, had been the subject of repairs which were authorized by the City of Charlotte through the issuing of building permits, the last of which was issued in November of 1959 for the re-roofing of the entire dwelling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">3. That the defendants, by letter and Order dated March 24, 1964, ordered plaintiff to remove his dwelling within 30 days from the date of the letter and order as the same is set forth in Paragraph IV of the complaint.  That defendants order was issued after proper administrative procedure as set forth by the North Carolina General Statutes and by the Code of the City of Charlotte had been followed.  That defendants' order was issued along with notice to plaintiff that plaintiff's building had been found to be unsafe pursuant to Sections 5-6(e) of the Charlotte Building Code; further, these Code provisions set forth a procedure for notice, opportunity to be heard and the right to appeal from decisions of the Superintendent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">4. That the order to remove said dwelling as aforesaid was based upon an inspection of plaintiff's premises, and was issued after administrative procedures specified and set forth in the Charlotte Building Code had been&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  followed by defendants as set forth in the letter and Order dated March 24th, 1964.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">5. That no warrant for entry and inspection of the plaintiff's dwelling was had or secured by the defendants and no search warrant is required by law and is set forth in Paragraph 5 of the Further Answer and Defense of the defendants.  That plaintiff was present at the time this building was inspected on June 23rd, 1964, and plaintiff, at no time, prohibited defendants from entering and inspecting his building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">6. That by June 23, 1964, plaintiff had made extensive repairs to his dwelling, including the replacement of windows, doors and siding on the house and that plaintiff was tried and convicted for making repairs without a permit as is set forth in Paragraph IX of the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">7. That the action of the defendants in condemning and ordering plaintiff's dwelling removed after inspection was authorized and done pursuant to authority of law, to wit: G.S. 160-151, Charlotte City Charter, Section 6.61 and 6.162 and the Building Code of the City of Charlotte, Section 5-6(e) as the same are set forth in Paragraph III (a), (b) and (c) of the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">8. That plaintiff is in violation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  of the Order of March 24, 1964, and intends to remain in violation of the same for reasons set forth in Paragraph XI of the complaint and other paragraphs of the complaint.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Ervin entered judgment:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;2. The Constitutions of the United States and the State of North Carolina protect property owners from unreasonable invasions of their right to privacy, and against public entry of government agents, unless such entry is pursuant to a valid warrant or unless entry to the property is permitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">3. The Constitution of North Carolina prohibits municipal investigating agents and officials from exercising unbridled discretion in making standards and formulating rules concerning building safety, and such officials may act only pursuant to reasonable statutory limitations or guidelines as set forth in municipal ordinances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">4. The acts in question set forth reasonable standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">5. Property owners are guaranteed a right to procedural due process by the Constitutions of the United States and the State of North Carolina.  Sections 5-6 and 5-7 of the Charlotte City Code establishes procedures conforming to administrative due processes&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  and comply with the Constitutions of North Carolina and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">6. The issuance of building permits and the control of building repairs are generally valid exercises of police power, and a municipality may promulgate ordinances to secure the health and safety within its limits even though statutory authority for such ordinances be general in nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">7. It is therefore, the conclusion of this court that North Carolina General Statute 160-151, Charlotte Charter provisions under sections 6.61 and 6.162, and Charlotte Code provisions 5-6 and 5-7, set forth reasonable procedures for the exercise of police power, and do not violate the Constitutions of North Carolina and the United States, and that the City of Charlotte, pursuant to said provisions, has acted in a valid and constitutional manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">IT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that North Carolina General Statute 160-151, Sections 6.61 and 6.162 of the Charlotte City Charter, and Sections 5-6 and 5-7 of the Charlotte City Code are valid and constitutional; and a temporary restraining order presently in effect against defendants' removal or demolition of plaintiff's dwelling house located at 1449&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  South Church Street in the City of Charlotte, be and is hereby dissolved.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Petitioner property owner appealed from the judgment of the Mecklenburg County Superior Court (North Carolina), which found for defendants, a city and a city superintendent, and dissolved a temporary restraining order granted to the owner to restrain defendants' from removing or demolishing the owner's house.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The owner moved for a temporary restraining order against defendants after they ordered him to remove his dwelling within 30 days from the date of the letter because the building was found to be violation of the Charlotte, N.C., Building Code &sect; 5-6(e). Prior to the order, the owner unsuccessfully attacked the safety regulations and was convicted of violating the city code by attempting to make repairs without a permit. The owner unsuccessfully sought appeal, a writ of habeas corpus in the federal court, and an appeal of that decision. Proper administrative procedures were followed in order to find the building unsafe, and the trial court ordered the owner to comply with defendant's request of removal. The court affirmed and held that &sect; 5-6(e), N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 160-51, and Charlotte, N.C. Charter &sect;&sect; 6.61, 6.162 were not unconstitutional because the city had an interest in protecting the public by setting safety guidelines for buildings and other structures. The court held that the owner's private and proprietary interests were subordinate to the public's interest; therefore the safety guidelines were valid, and the owner was in violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court affirmed the trial court judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c1"><SPAN CLASS="c4">January 6, 1970, Filed </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by Woodstock Electric Membership Corporation and North Carolina Electric Membership Corporation from the decision of the Court of Appeals, reported in 5 N.C. App. 663.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woodstock Electric Membership Corporation, hereinafter called Woodstock, and Virginia Electric and Power Company, hereinafter called VEPCO, are suppliers of electric power to users thereof in Beaufort, Hyde and Washington Counties.  Subsequent to the enactment in 1965 of G.S. 62-110.2, Woodstock applied to the Utilities Commission for the assignment to it of extensive areas in those counties lying outside the corporate limits of any municipality and more than 300 feet from any then existing line of any supplier.  Shortly thereafter, VEPCO filed a like application.  As to some of the areas the two applications overlapped, so that both applicants sought the right to supply electric power in the same area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Utilities Commission consolidated the applications for hearing.  At such hearing voluminous evidence, both oral and documentary, was introduced by both applicants.  The Commission made extensive findings of fact and reached certain conclusions upon which it entered an order assigning to each applicant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  alone areas applied for by it only and certain of the areas for which both had applied.  These portions of the order are not presently in controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to certain other areas, designated B-1 to B-6, inclusive, the Commission ordered that Woodstock alone serve all users therein whose demand for power does not exceed 400 kilowatts and that any user therein whose demand exceeds that limit be served either by Woodstock or by VEPCO, depending upon which supplier the user chose to serve it.  The effect is that in these areas Woodstock alone may serve residential, agricultural, commercial and small industrial users -- the categories of users served by Woodstock in the past -- while large industrial users -- of which none presently exist and none have ever existed in any of these areas -- would be served by Woodstock or by VEPCO as each user may prefer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six areas in question are exclusively rural and completely undeveloped for industrial purposes at the present time.  Explorations in recent years have disclosed in the B-6 area extensive phosphate deposits, which offer basis for widespread expectation that substantial mining operations may soon be begun in that area and may be followed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the establishment therein of mining facilities and other related industrial enterprises, each of which will consume large quantities of electric power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woodstock and North Carolina Electric Membership Corporation, an intervenor before the Utilities Commission, appealed from the order of the Commission to the Court of Appeals.  That court held the Utilities Commission had made an assignment of areas B-1 to B-6, inclusive, of a type permitted by the statute,&nbsp;G.S. 62-110.2(c)(1), but had not made findings of fact sufficient to support its establishment of the 400 KW demand as the dividing line between the exclusive right of Woodstock to serve and the right of the user to choose its supplier.  On that ground, the Court of Appeals reversed the order of the Utilities Commission and remanded the matter to the Commission &quot;for such further proceedings as may be appropriate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woodstock and the intervenor appealed to this Court on the ground that the type of assignment made by the Commission in the six areas, which the Court of Appeals held not unlawful per se, would violate rights of Woodstock guaranteed by Art. I, &sect;&sect; 7 and 17, of the Constitution of North Carolina, and by the Fourteenth&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.  Simultaneously, the appellants filed their petition for writ of certiorari to review the decision of the Court of Appeals on the ground that it failed to hold the order of the Utilities Commission to be in excess of the statutory authority of the Commission and arbitrary in that the order undertakes to permit both suppliers to serve within the same area.  That is, Woodstock makes no point of the selection by the Utilities Commission of a demand level of 400 KW as the division line in Areas B-1 to B-6, but contends that, both as a matter of its constitutional right and by virtue of the statute under which the Utilities Commission has acted, no order can be valid which permits both suppliers to operate in these areas, whatever demand level be taken as the division point between Woodstock's exclusive right to serve and the right of the user to select its supplier.  For this reason, Woodstock contends that the order of the Court of Appeals remanding the proceeding for further action by the Utilities Commission in fixing this division point is erroneous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both VEPCO and the Utilities Commission contend that the Court of Appeals correctly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ruled that no constitutional right of Woodstock has been violated by the order of the Commission, or would be violated by a similar order issued after further proceedings pursuant to the remand directed by the Court of Appeals.  VEPCO further contends that, while review by this Court is premature until the Commission has acted under the remand, the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the findings of fact made by the Commission are not sufficient to support its choice of the demand level of 400 KW as the division line.  The Utilities Commission raises no objection to the remand of the proceeding to it but does not concede that its findings of fact are insufficient to support its order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woodstock brought forward in the record on appeal, both in the Court of Appeals and in this Court, only a portion of the evidence introduced before the Utilities Commission, its contention being that the findings of fact made by the Commission do not support its order, not that any finding of fact is unsupported by competent evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order of the Utilities Commission is not set forth in the record filed with this Court, but all portions thereof, deemed pertinent to this appeal by the parties, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are quoted in the opinion of the Court of Appeals.  Of these, the portions set forth below are determinative of the questions presented upon this review of the decision of the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Utilities Commission made the following findings of fact:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;1. Both VEPCO and Woodstock are electric suppliers as defined by Section 62-110.2(a)(3) of the North Carolina General Statutes; * * *.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;2. * * * VEPCO generates the preponderance of the electric power it sells.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;3. * * * Woodstock does not generate electric power, but purchases the preponderance of its total requirements as a wholesale customer of VEPCO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;4. Both VEPCO and Woodstock are capable of supplying, and do supply, good, adequate, and dependable electric service for the requirements of their existing customers and members, respectively, in the areas of the three counties mentioned.  * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;7. The entire area of the applications, being situate outside the corporate limits of municipalities, and more than 300 feet from the lines of another supplier as defined by the Act, must be described as rural and agricultural.  * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;8. The historical development of electrical facilities in the area as a whole may be described&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  as follows: For many years, VEPCO has served Woodstock as well as the municipal systems of the Cities of Washington and Belhaven at wholesale.  * * * VEPCO's distribution facilities are concentrated almost exclusively in the northern third of the total area.  For the purpose of moving bulk power, VEPCO has a 34.5 KV line in the southern portion of the total area * * * VEPCO has one (1) retail distribution customer on this line at approximately 400 KW demand.  * * * Woodstock's distribution facilities * * * may be said to cover the southern two-thirds of the area * * *.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;11. In one large area in Beaufort County * * * (marked B-6 on VEPCO Exhibit No. 2 and hereafter referred to as the 'B-6' area) there are no lines of any supplier as defined in the Act other than Woodstock * * *.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Woodstock seeks to have this area assigned to it; VEPCO seeks to have the area left unassigned or, in the alternative, assigned to VEPCO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;12. In the areas * * * marked B-1 and B-3 on VEPCO Exhibit No. 2 (and hereafter referred to by reference to the VEPCO Exhibit) there are virtually no facilities of any supplier as defined in the Act other than Woodstock, except for VEPCO's 34.5 KV line through Area B-3&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  and the VEPCO retail customer in Area B-1, as previously found.  * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;14. The area marked B-2 * * * has the aforesaid 34.5 KV line running east-west through the south-central portion.  The area marked B-5 * * * has the aforesaid 34.5 KV line running along the northern border thereof.  There are no other lines of a supplier as defined by the Act in either area.  * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;15. The areas designated B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4 and B-5 * * * are areas of potential industrial development * * *.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;16. The area designated B-6 * * * is an area of great industrial potential in that it has been established that the area contains one of the richest phosphate deposits in the United States, is under active consideration for phosphate mining operations * * *.  These mining operations and processes usually require complex and technical electric power accommodations, very large blocks of available power, alternate sources of power supply, and experienced supplier personnel readily available and technically trained.  Further, such mining operations tend to attract allied industrials, such as chemicals and fertilizer, having large power requirements, and requiring large capital investments to install service. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;17. Industrial and manufacturing concerns tend to locate on and demand the services of VEPCO as opposed to Woodstock.  There are many reasons for this.  Some industries are philosophically opposed to, and wary of, becoming members in cooperatives where they have no more protection than a single vote in rate and policy matters, i.e., they prefer the regulation of the State Commission to the regulation of the Cooperatives' membership and the REA.  Others base their preference on the electric utility's financial strength and its ability to supply operational expertise, specialized equipment, alternate and emergency supplies of energy and many others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Industries usually have more than one available site for location and, all other things being equal, tend to choose that site served or to be served by VEPCO and tend not to choose the site to be served by Woodstock.  While the phosphate deposit in the B-6 area will require the mining industry to locate there without regard to which supplier is assigned the area, the testimony of mining officials is to the effect that assignment to Woodstock would tend to cause their companies not to perform all their mining processes on site and that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  they probably would only mine the basic product and ship it elsewhere for operations and processes requiring heavy electric loads.  The testimony further indicates that manufacturers and producers other than mining will tend not to locate near the mines if the area is assigned exclusively to Woodstock.  * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;19. The areas where Woodstock's facilities are located are predominantly residential and farming, or rural, areas.  * * * Woodstock serves two (2) industrial customers with demands greater than 50 KW.  Its largest service demand is to Coastal Lumber Company, with a demand exceeding 240 KW and possibly as high as 400 KW demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;20. The portions of the total area in which VEPCO's facilities are located are also predominantly residential and farming, or rural, areas.  However, VEPCO has a number of very large power users in this and other states.  It has a permanent staff of experts in promoting industrial development and attending to complex power supply and load requirements.  * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;23. VEPCO is financed by capital furnished from the sale of securities in the financial markets and from internally generated funds.  Its bonds are rated AA, and it has a proven ability to raise&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  large sums of capital on comparatively short notice.  * * * While Woodstock has never been called upon to provide service for which it could not obtain capital, it nevertheless has not been called upon to raise capital to meet the electric needs of extremely large industrial customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;24. Woodstock is organized and exists for the purpose of furnishing electricity to persons in rural areas not otherwise having central station service.  It is not organized to, and does not operate on, the basis of 'pecuniary profit,' as does VEPCO.  For this reason, the procurement of large volume industrial loads is not as fully compatible with the corporate and public objectives of Woodstock as it is with VEPCO.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After making the foregoing findings of fact, the Utilities Commission made the following statements which the Commission does not specifically designate &quot;Findings of Fact&quot;:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;From the testimony and from experience in other matters involving electric cooperatives and power companies, it appears to us almost universally true that cooperative members prefer a continuation and expansion of cooperative service and territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;On the other hand, industry, particularly heavy industry, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  just as strongly prefers the service of the power company.  * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;* * * Traditionally, the cooperative has not attracted industry to its service area while the power company has.  The attraction of the capital wealth of industry also builds up residential loads.  We are convinced that many areas of the State will be handicapped in, if not precluded from, obtaining industry, unless weight is given to industry's obvious preferences for the power company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Further, we hold that the power company is better equipped and better able to serve heavy industrial loads.  We are of the considered opinion that it would be harmful both to the cooperative and to the public in an area with industrial potential to assign that area to the cooperative for all purposes.  On the other hand, where in many cases the cooperative has historically served the residential, agricultural, and small commercial loads, we think it would be manifestly unjust and duplicative to take this area and their potential residential, agricultural, and commercial loads from the cooperative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the basis of these &quot;findings of fact&quot; and statements, the Commission assigned areas B-1 to B-6, inclusive, as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;To Woodstock for purposes of loads up to and including 400 KW demand; all loads with contract demands greater than 400 KW being hereby assigned jointly to VEPCO and Woodstock; provided that this joint assignment is made subject to the consumers' reasonable choice of supplier * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant electric membership cooperatives sought review of an order from the North Carolina Court of Appeals, which remanded to appellee North Carolina Utilities Commission (commission) a proceeding involving applications for assignment of electric service areas. Appellee public utility company (company) and one electric membership cooperative (cooperative) both applied for the assignment of areas pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 62-110.2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The applications filed by the company and by the cooperative requested assignment of extensive areas in rural communities. The commission ordered that the cooperative alone could serve smaller users and that both applicants could serve large industrial users as each user preferred. The court of appeals' order remanded to the commission on the ground that the commission did not make findings of fact sufficient to support its establishment of the dividing line between small and large users. The court reversed the order and remanded to the court of appeals for entry of a judgment affirming the commission's order. The court held that the court of appeals erred in concluding that the facts found by the commission were insufficient to support the determination of the dividing line. The court also rejected the cooperatives' contention that the commission's order violated their constitutional rights. Further, the court held that the commission did not exceed its authority under &sect; 62-110.2 by dividing the territory into two service areas and by assigning the large industrial user area to both applicants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The magistrate's warrant on which this criminal prosecution is based authorized the arrest of defendant for the alleged criminal offense described in the attached affidavit of Lindsay W. Cox, Guilford County Planning Director, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">viz.:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The undersigned, Lindsay Cox, being duly sworn, complains and says that at and in the County named above and on or about the 26th day of January, 1967, the defendant named above did unlawfully, wilfully, did transfer or sell certain property described in the deed recorded in Deed Book, 2331, at page 32, in the Office of the Register of Deeds, Guilford County Courthouse, Greensboro, North Carolina, by reference to a plat showing a sub-division of land before such plat had been properly approved under the Guilford County Sub-Division Ordinance and recorded in the Office of the Register of Deeds of Guilford County, such reference constituting the committing of a misdemeanor in accordance with Chapter 153-266.6 which is incorporated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the Guilford County Sub-Division Ordinance at Section 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The offense charged here was committed against the peace and dignity of the State and in violation of law according to Chapter 153-266.6 of the General Statutes of the State of North Carolina.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the district court, defendant moved to quash the warrant.  Upon denial of his motion, defendant entered a plea of not guilty.  The court found the defendant guilty and entered the following judgment: &quot;Prayer for Judgment continued 12 months Pay 50.00 fine and cost.&quot; Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the superior court, before pleading to the accusation set forth therein, defendant moved to quash the warrant on the ground &quot;the same does not charge an offense under the laws of North Carolina, the statute referred to being unconstitutional, invalid and void.&quot; The court allowed defendant's motion and entered judgment quashing the warrant and dismissing the action.  Neither the motion to quash nor the judgment indicates any specific ground for holding G.S. 153-266.6&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The district court convicted defendant of violation of &sect; 153-266.6 upon his guilty plea after the district court denied his motion to quash the warrant. The superior court quashed the warrant. On appeal by the State, the court affirmed. The court found that the general allegation in the warrant that defendant's conduct constituted a misdemeanor in violation of &sect; 153-266.6 was insufficient. The court held that there was no allegation that the property was located within the &quot;platting jurisdiction&quot; granted to the county commissioners by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 153-266.1 or that it was located in a portion of the county outside the subdivision-regulation jurisdiction of any municipality. The court concluded that the warrant was fatally defective on account of its failure to allege one of the essential elements of the criminal offense created and defined in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 153-266.6, namely, that defendant was the owner or agent of the owner of land within the platting jurisdiction granted to the county commissioners by N.C. Gen.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These cases, more than forty in number, were consolidated by consent for hearing in the Juvenile Court of Hyde County.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All persons involved in these proceedings are juveniles residing in Hyde County, North Carolina.  On six different occasions in November and December, 1968, these juveniles (with the exception of James Lambert Howard) were observed by State Highway Patrolmen standing upon the public highway tossing a basketball back and forth and singing, clapping, and marching.  &quot;Between September 11th and November 13th they marched practically every day.&quot; As a result, vehicular traffic was prevented&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from proceeding in either direction.  The juveniles and numerous adults were asked to remove themselves from the road to allow traffic to pass.  They either refused to do so or left the roadway and immediately returned.

The judge stated that he was preparing to conduct a juvenile hearing -- not a criminal trial, and that no child would be found to have committed a crime.  He thereupon ordered the general public excluded and stated that only officers of the court, the juveniles, their parents or guardians, their attorney and witnesses would be present for the hearing.  Judge Ward further announced that only the juvenile cases would be heard and that no other court business would be conducted.  In each instance, counsel for the juveniles objected to the exclusion of the general public and demanded a jury trial.  The objection was overruled and request for jury trial denied.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) absent a statute providing for a jury trial, a juvenile had no right under the federal and state constitutions to a trial by jury; (2) juveniles had no right under U.S. Const. amend. VI to a public trial for delinquency because a public hearing was not in their best interests; (3) the North Carolina Juvenile Court Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 2-110, was not unconstitutional because the statute was not vague or uncertain; and (4) the juvenile court did not err by preventing an appeal in forma pauperis because juvenile proceedings were not criminal cases appealable to the superior court, and appointment of counsel for indigent defendants and permission to appeal in forma pauperis had no application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bailey, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the August 28, 1967, Criminal Session, Durham Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal prosecution upon a bill of indictment charging defendant with the crime of rape on Mrs. Edna Meachum.  The jury returned a verdict of guilty as charged with a recommendation of life imprisonment.  From judgment in accordance therewith defendant gave notice of appeal to the Supreme Court.  M. C. Burt, Jr., his court-appointed counsel, neglected to perfect said appeal and, after reprimand, was removed as counsel and Attorney W. P. Whichard was appointed in his stead.  Petition for certiorari to the Superior Court of Durham County as a substitute for appeal under Rule 34, Rules of Practice in the Supreme Court, was thereupon filed on behalf of defendant and allowed by order of this Court in conference on 11 February 1969.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show that Mrs. Edna Meachum, twenty-nine years old, lives with her mother at 826 N. Mangum Street in Durham.  On January 14, 1967, she left home at 7:30 p.m., going uptown to meet a girl friend and then to the movies.  She was wearing a skirt and blouse, low-heeled shoes, and an all-weather coat.  As she walked up Mangum&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Street, she saw three colored boys walking toward her.  Before reaching her they turned and began walking in the same direction she was going.  Two walked very slowly and the third ran on ahead.  Mrs. Meachum began walking faster so as to pass the two in front of the Curb Market where people were standing.  She crossed Hunt Street walking fast.  Just as she reached the other side of the S &amp; H Green Stamp Store she heard something hit the sidewalk, turned to look and saw her assailant standing behind her.  She had never seen him before and did not know his name.  As she turned to look he put his left arm around her neck.  She asked him what he wanted and he replied, &quot;You know what I want.&quot; He started dragging her backwards across the parking lot.  She began screaming and he struck her on the head two or three times with his fist and said, &quot;I am going to kill you if you don't quit screaming.&quot; He had a belt around his neck and she was afraid he might use it to choke her.  When he got to the rear of the store building he told her he had a gun and was going to kill her.  He said, &quot;I am going to get what I want and then I am going to kill you,&quot; and she kept crying and begging him to let&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  her go.  There was no one else in the vicinity.  The Stamp Store was closed at that time.  There was a street lamp at the front of the store but it was dark behind the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Meachum lost her balance while being forced backwards.  Her foot caught on a rock at the rear of the store and she fell over backwards on muddy ground with her assailant on top of her.  He kept telling her to be quiet, to shut up, that he was going to kill her.  He had sexual relations with her forcibly and against her will.  While still on top of her he demanded her money.  She removed $ 3.00 -- all she had -- from her pocketbook and gave it to him.  He then got up, ran to the bottom of the bank and stood there looking back at her.  Mrs. Meachum arose quickly, found her shoes which were lost in the scuffle, and ran around to the parking lot.  She then ran up the street to the police department and reported the incident.  Her coat was muddy, her hair and clothing wet.  She told the police her assailant was a young colored male with smooth skin, hair cut short, dressed in a dark blue jacket and dark pants and had a men's leather belt looped loosely and hanging around his neck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following day, January&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  15, 1967, at about 7:00 p.m., Mrs. Meachum returned to the police station on request to view four young colored boys, including defendant.  One boy was taller than the defendant.  The other two were about his size.  One had on a dark navy blue jacket and a pair of dark trousers.  One was wearing a dark sweater.  Defendant was dressed in a shirt and dungaree-type pants, which made him look a little different, and had a belt hanging around his neck.  Mrs. Meachum viewed the four boys through a two-way glass window and identified defendant as the person who had raped her the previous evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After conducting a voir dire in the absence of the jury, during which evidence for both the State and the defendant was heard, including Dr. Bruce Kyles' report set out in the next paragraph, the trial judge found that the lineup was fairly and legally conducted and the evidence relating to defendant's identification admissible.  Mrs. Meachum then identified defendant in court before the jury as noted in the opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pending trial, on motion of court-appointed counsel, defendant was committed to Cherry Hospital at Goldsboro for a 60-day observation period.  The clinical summary describes defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as an alert, pleasant lad oriented in all areas with an I.Q. of 59 -- moderate mental deficiency.  This summary further reveals that from October 1962 to April 1966 -- or from age 11 to 14 -- defendant had been arrested nine times for such things as store breaking, taking money, taking merchandise, and assault and battery.  Defendant reluctantly admitted this history after initially stating that the present rape case was the only trouble he had ever had with the law.  The diagnosis is &quot;mental deficiency, moderate degree, with behavioral disturbance, code #6113.&quot; Dr. Kyles thereupon returned defendant to court as able to stand trial, stating, &quot;It is the carefully considered opinion of the medical staff at Cherry Hospital that Lewis Thomas Rogers, Jr., is able to plead to the bill of indictment against him.  He knows right from wrong, is aware of the nature and probable consequences of the offense with which he is charged, and in our opinion is able to consult with counsel in the preparation of his defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Norman Bowles did a pelvic examination on Mrs. Meachum on the evening of January 14, in the Emergency Department at Watts Hospital.  A wet smear from the vagina showed the presence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of live male sperm.  Mrs. Meachum had mud in her hair and on her shoulder and an abrasion on the right shoulder.  She was upset and was admitted to the hospital until the following day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William S. Best, a chemist with the SBI for twelve years, received Mrs. Meachum's coat and defendant's shoes from Officer Hicks, and took them to Dr. Buol at the Soil Science Department at North Carolina State University.  He later received them back from Dr. Buol and returned them to Officer Hicks.  They were offered and allowed in evidence over defendant's objection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Stanley W. Buol, an expert in the field of soil analysis and soil science, testified without objection that three soil samples -- one from the coat and one from each shoe -- were carbon copies of each other and, in his opinion, certainly came from the same site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence for the defendant: Leo Kimball testified that between 7:00 and 7:30 p.m. on Saturday night, January 14, 1967, he picked defendant up at the corner of Canal and Roxboro Streets in Durham, drove to the corner of Roxboro and Dowd Streets where he picked up Sammy Melvin and James Green, and then drove to a clubhouse on Todd Street in Millgrove; that the four of them&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  remained at said club until 11:00 p.m., when he drove back to North Durham and put defendant off on the corner of Canal and Roxboro.  Evidence to the same effect was given by James Green and Samuel Melvin.  These three witnesses each denied being a member of a gang known as the &quot;Hunt Street Angels.&quot; Green and Melvin stated they had heard of the group but did not belong to it.  Melvin stated that some of the &quot;Hunt Street Angels&quot; wore belts around their necks at times; that he had seen them walking two at a time with belts around their necks; and that he had seen defendant wear a belt around his neck although defendant did not have a belt there on the night they went to the club on Todd Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered a certificate of his birth showing birthdate of February 2, 1952.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Miriam Clifford, a school psychologist employed by the Education Improvement Program of Duke University, testified that she works primarily with the public schools; that she did a mental and intelligence examination on defendant at the request of his mother in June 1966; that defendant made a score indicating an I.Q. of 63, which places him in the lowest two percent of the population; that his I.Q. will&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not likely improve with age; that the tests she gave have nothing directly to do with whether defendant is sane or not sane; that she saw no evidence of mental illness and has no evidence at all on whether he knew right from wrong because she has no way of making a judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant did not testify in his own behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer McCrea, in rebuttal, testified that the witness Sammy Melvin told him that on Saturday night, the 14th of January, he, the defendant, and Melvin's brother had been to the West End and had walked back to Hunt Street; that the three of them then parted and Lewis Rogers went back in the direction of the City of Durham, going south on Mangum Street, and that he never saw defendant any more that night; that it was about 7:00 or 7:30 p.m. when he and defendant parted there on Mangum Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other evidence pertinent to discussion of the various assignments of error is, to avoid repetition, omitted here and will be noted in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant challenged a ruling from the Superior Court of Durham County (North Carolina), which entered a judgment of conviction for rape against defendant. The jury recommended life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant was age 14 at the time of the crime and had an I.Q. of 63. Defendant complained that prospective jurors were questioned as to their belief in capital punishment and that persons of his race were systematically excused from the grand jury that indicted him. After defendant's conviction for rape, his court-appointed counsel neglected to perfect an appeal and was removed. The replacement petitioned for a writ of certiorari pursuant to N.C. R. Prac. Sup. Ct. 34. The court found no error. Defendant's age was not a barrier because infants of the age of 14 were not entitled to any presumption of incapacity, and low mentality in itself was no defense to a criminal charge. Questions on voir dire about belief in capital punishment did not constitute error. There was no record to show how many of the petit jurors, if any, were excused for cause. The fact that the County Commissioners of Durham County used only the names on the tax records in making up jury lists did not show racial discrimination in the selection of jurors, and the Commissioners' failure to comply with available procedures to widen the scope of prospective jurors did not void defendant's indictment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action for a mandatory injunction directing the defendants to cease certain activities, which the plaintiff alleges to be unconstitutional and otherwise unlawful, and nullifying all past transactions between the defendants and all others &quot;to the end that the defendants and all who may have dealt with them may be restored to their original positions.&quot; The plaintiff also prayed for a temporary restraining order, which was not granted.  He appeals from a judgment of nonsuit and dismissal of the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff alleges that he is a taxpayer of the City of Raleigh, Wake County, the State and the United States.  He also alleges that he is a stockholder in one or more corporations, which pay franchise taxes to the State, taxes upon property located within the State and income taxes to the United States and which have issued interest bearing notes and bonds, that these securities are not exempt from taxation in North Carolina and that the rates of interest paid&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by such corporations thereon are higher than they would be if such interest were exempt from taxation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff alleges that he will sustain irreparable injury from the acts of which he complains unless the injunctive relief for which he prays is granted, but does not allege how he will be injured unless such injury be inherent in his status as taxpayer or as shareholder.  The answer of each defendant denies that the plaintiff will sustain such injury and denies that the State Education Assistance Authority has been or is carrying on any activity which is unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful.  Except for these denials the several answers admit the allegations of the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint alleges in substance (numbering revised):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) The Authority is a corporate body, created by Chapter 1180 of the Session Laws of 1965.  By Chapter 1177 of the Session Laws of 1967, the General Assembly undertook &quot;to vest in the Authority power to issue tax exempt revenue bonds </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">not pledging the credit of the State</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (emphasis added) and to make available the proceeds of these bonds for financing loans to North Carolina students to enable them to obtain an education in an 'eligible institution'&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as defined in Title 20 of the United States Code.  The College Foundation, Inc., is a North Carolina non-profit corporation engaged in the business of making loans to North Carolina students for use in educational pursuits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) The Authority adopted a Resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds in the total amount of $ 3,000,000, a copy of which Resolution is attached to the complaint.  (The said Resolution covers 74 printed pages in the record and sets forth in great detail the form of the bonds to be issued under it, the use to be made of the proceeds, and the bookkeeping and accounting procedure to be followed.) The Authority has issued and sold such bonds at a privately negotiated sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) The Authority, the Foundation and the Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Company, which is the &quot;fiscal agent&quot; of the Authority, entered into a tripartite contract, a copy of which is attached to the complaint.  (The contract likewise sets forth in detail the undertakings of the several parties concerning the use by the Authority of the proceeds of the said bonds to purchase from the Foundation notes, representing loans previously made by the Foundation to students, and concerning the collection of such&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  notes and the handling of funds, accounting and bookkeeping procedures, etc.).  The proceeds of the bonds so issued have been used, pursuant to the said contract, for such purchase by the Authority from the Foundation of such student notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) Thereafter, the Authority adopted a further Resolution, a copy of which is attached to the complaint, authorizing its officers and employees to issue another series of bonds, also in the total amount of $ 3,000,000, the proceeds of which will be used &quot;in making or buying student loans during the academic year 1969-1970.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(5) The General Assembly of 1967 appropriated from the general tax revenues of the State funds for use by the Authority in the performance &quot;of its lawful functions&quot; during the two years ending 30 June 1969.  From the funds so appropriated the Authority has made expenditures for salaries and expenses of its employees and other &quot;necessary office cost,&quot; including the expense of the Secretary of the Authority in traveling to New York for the purpose of executing the first series of bonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(6) &quot;In expressing its intent to issue a further series of these bonds * * * the Authority has indicated that additional tax funds will be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  expended.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(7) Chapter 1177 of the Session Laws of 1967, pursuant to which the Authority has so acted, is unconstitutional in that it conflicts with Article V, &sect; 3, Article I, &sect; 7, Article I, &sect; 8, and Article V, &sect; 5, of the Constitution of North Carolina, and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.  If the said Act of the General Assembly be deemed constitutional, the actions of the defendants are nevertheless unlawful because the tripartite contract and provisions of the bond resolution are in conflict with the said Act of the Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the matter came on for a hearing in the superior court, a jury trial was waived and the matter was submitted to the court under an agreed statement of facts, setting forth, in substance, the facts alleged in the complaint and admitted in the answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties further stipulated in the superior court that eleven detailed questions are &quot;the questions of law which arise upon the facts and which are to be determined.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The superior court found the facts to be as so stipulated and that these were &quot;all of the facts that are competent for a determination of this controversy.&quot; Thereupon, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the court set forth its conclusions of law as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(1) That the agreed facts show that the General Assembly of North Carolina in the enactment of Chapter 1177, Session Laws of 1967, has acknowledged its and the State's responsibility to its citizens under the Constitution of North Carolina to further education of North Carolina students beyond the level of secondary education by making available funds through student loans to enable these students to pursue their education and by this pursuit to better prepare themselves for their lives as responsible North Carolina taxpaying Citizens and that Chapter 1177, Session Laws of 1967, is a permissible method of promoting such public purposes and constitutes a valid use of public funds for public purposes required by Section 3 of Article V and Section 17 of Article I of the North Carolina Constitution and Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and said Chapter 1177 does not authorize the use of public funds for other than a public purpose in violation of Section 3 of Article V or Section 17 of Article I of the North Carolina Constitution or Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(2) Chapter 1177, Session Laws of 1967, does not authorize the lending of the credit of the State in violation of Section 4 of Article V of the North Carolina Constitution and does not authorize any entitlement to exclusive or separate emoluments or privileges in violation of Section 7 of Article I of the North Carolina Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(3) Chapter 1177, Session Laws of 1967, does not provide a delegation of legislative authority in violation of Section 8 of Article I of the North Carolina Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(4) Chapter 1177, Session Laws of 1967, does not authorize the creation of a debt in violation of Section 4 of Article V of the North Carolina Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(5) Chapter 1177, Session Laws of 1967, does not exempt property from taxation in violation of Section 5 of Article V of the North Carolina Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(6) Chapter 1177, Session Laws of 1967, is in every respect valid and constitutional in accordance with the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(7) That State Education Assistance Authority and the members of its Board of Directors and Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Company, N.A., and College Foundation, Inc. have proceeded in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  a lawful manner to carry out their duties and functions in execution of the powers of Chapter 1177, Session Laws of 1967, and their resolutions, contracts and actions taken in furtherance of their duties and as set forth in the Agreed Statement of Facts are in each and every respect lawful, and specifically that:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c31"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(a) The powers vested in the 'Fiscal Agent,' Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Company, N.A., under the bond resolution, are consistent with the legislative enactment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c32"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(c) The provisions of the bond resolution respecting the creation and administration of the 'loan fund' and the 'sinking fund' and the 'current expense account' and the flow of funds thereunder are not in conflict with the provisions of the enabling legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c32"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(d) The tripartite contract is not in violation of Chapter 1177 and the Constitution of the State of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c32"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(e) The powers vested in College Foundation under the tripartite contract are not in conflict with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  Chapter 1177.</SPAN></P>

<BR><BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The superior court thereupon adjudged that the Authority is authorized and empowered to perform all of the acts set forth in Chapter 1177 of the Session Laws of 1967 in the manner in which it has proceeded to do so, and adjudged that the plaintiff be nonsuited and the action dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The taxpayer alleged he paid taxes in the state and he was a stockholder in corporations that paid taxes within the state.

The proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used for financing loans to North Carolina students. The taxpayer claimed that 1967 N.C. Sess.

The court modified and affirmed, holding that: (1) where the taxpayer failed to allege facts showing that any contemplated or threatened use of funds or other activities by the authority, foundation, or fiscal agent would result in injury to the taxpayer as a taxpayer or shareholder of any corporation, the constitutional challenge was not properly before the court and injunctive relief was not appropriate; and (2) there was error in part of the trial court's holding adjudging the authority was empowered to perform all acts set forth in 1967 N.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff from decision of the North Carolina Court of Appeals filed 26 February 1969 and reported in 4 N.C. App. 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action for declaratory judgment brought pursuant to Article 26 of Chapter 1 of the North Carolina General Statutes.  The parties are seeking to determine if the City can require defendant railway company to bear the entire cost of constructing a new overpass bridge to replace the original bridge carrying defendant's tracks over Peace Street in the City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 18 January 1907 plaintiff City adopted an ordinance granting defendant's predecessor a franchise to construct, maintain, and operate a railroad in Raleigh.  Among other things, the franchise gave the railroad the authority to build a bridge for its tracks across Peace Street in accord with certain specifications.  Pursuant to and in conformity with these specifications the railroad built the bridge across Peace Street so that the bridge abutments were constructed on the street right of way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 2 March 1959 the Raleigh City Council approved a &quot;thoroughfare plan&quot; for the City designating certain streets, including Peace Street, which would be widened to accommodate increased amounts of automotive&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  traffic within the City.  The proposed widening of Peace Street required the reconstruction of defendant's bridge and in 1962 the City and defendant railroad jointly prepared plans for a new bridge with the understanding that the City would bear the entire cost.  The City Attorney, after learning that the abutments of defendant's bridge were in the City's Peace Street right of way, proposed that the City adopt an ordinance requiring the railway at its own expense to remove the bridge abutments from the right of way and assessing a penalty for the failure to do so within a certain time.  The railway appeared before the City Council in opposition to the proposed ordinance, and after extended consideration the parties entered into an agreement, dated 8 January 1963, under which the railroad was to reconstruct the bridge and the parties were to submit to the Superior Court of Wake County the question of which party should ultimately bear the cost of reconstructing the bridge.  The City never adopted the proposed ordinance requiring the railroad to remove the bridge abutments from the City's right of way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the November 1967 Non-Jury Civil Session of Wake Superior Court Canady, J., made&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  detailed findings of fact relating to the changed conditions which had occurred in the years after the granting of the 1907 franchise to defendant's predecessor.  Reference is made to the opinion by Parker, J., of the North Carolina Court of Appeals, reported in 4 N.C. App. 1, for a full statement of the facts including the findings of fact and conclusions of law of Canady, J., in Wake Superior Court.  Here, it is sufficient to note that the change in conditions had been adverse to the railroad economically and that increased motor vehicle traffic, instead of any need for change by the railroad, motivated the reconstruction of the bridge.  Judge Canady concluded that it would be an unreasonable exercise of the police power for the City to impose on the railroad the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">entire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cost of rebuilding the bridge and entered judgment requiring the City to bear the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">entire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cost of the new bridge.  From this judgment the City appealed to the Court of Appeals.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Wake Superior Court.  Pursuant to the provisions of N. C. Gen. Stat. Sec. 7A-30(1), the City appealed to this Court.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff city appealed a decision from the Court of Appeals (North Carolina), which affirmed a judgment that required the city to bear the entire cost of a new bridge. The city commenced a declaratory judgment action to require defendant railroad to bear the entire cost of constructing a new overpass bridge to replace the original bridge carrying the railroad's tracks over the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The city prepared to widen a street, which required a new bridge. The railroad prepared plans for a new bridge with the understanding that the city was going to pay for it. It was proposed that the city adopt an ordinance that required the railroad to foot the bill. The city never adopted the ordinance, and the railroad constructed the bridge with the understanding that the courts would decide who would have to pay. The trial court held that it was an unreasonable exercise of police power for the city to impose the costs on the railroad, which was affirmed. The court recognized the city could pass ordinances as reasonable exercises of police power. The court noted that any ordinance was subject to constitutional limitations. The court recognized its role was to review the ordinance after it was passed to see if it was reasonable and constitutional. The court determined that it was the legislature's role to determine how to allocate the costs between the city and the railroad. The court indicated that it was not its role to provide advisory opinions. The court concluded, therefore, that because the ordinance was never actually adopted, the court had no role in the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court vacated the judgment of the appellate court. The court remanded the cause to the appellate court with directions to enter an order directing the trial court to vacate the judgment entered and dismiss the action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action in which plaintiff (Railway Company) seeks a judgment declaring unconstitutional and void, as applied to the factual situations here involved, two ordinances of defendant (City), and an injunction against the enforcement thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ordinances, adopted March 20, 1967, relate to widely separated grade crossings, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">viz.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: (1) The crossing in the northern sector of City where Railway Company's single track crosses 27th Street; and (2) the crossing in the western sector of City where Railway Company's single track crosses Bethesda Road.  They require that Railway Company </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">shall maintain</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> automatic signal devices at the street approaches to these crossings.  Each provides for the payment by City of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">one-half of the cost of constructing</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the required automatic signal devices &quot;up to a maximum of $ 5,000.00.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff alleged the provisions of these ordinances are unreasonable and arbitrary; that enforcement thereof would constitute an unlawful taking of plaintiff's property without due process of law; that Section 54 of the Charter of Winston-Salem (Chapter 232, Private Laws of 1927), as applied to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the factual situations here involved, is unconstitutional and void; and that, apart from constitutional considerations, the proportion of costs allocated to Railway Company exceeds the maximum permissible under designated General Statutes declaratory of State policy, including G.S. 136-20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its answer, in addition to a general denial of plaintiff's crucial allegations, City alleged that each of the crossings, under existing conditions, constitutes &quot;a hazard to persons and property&quot; on account of &quot;the lack of any signaling devices warning of approaching trains&quot;; that the safety of the public required &quot;that proper signaling devices be installed at both crossings&quot;; and that the challenged ordinances were enacted by its Board of Aldermen in the exercise of City's authority &quot;to enact such ordinances as are necessary to protect and safeguard the health, safety and general welfare of the public.&quot; City's answer contains no reference to Section 54 or any other portion of City's Charter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was stipulated &quot;that the Court might hear the evidence without a jury, make determinations of fact if any issues of fact arose during the trial, reach conclusions of law and enter a judgment. . . .&quot; The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  judgment recites that, &quot;upon the evidence presented,&quot; the court found the facts set forth in paragraphs numbered 1 through 42.  The court, as a basis for Findings of Fact Nos. 1 through 37, adopted, with immaterial variations, the facts which were stipulated (for the purposes of this case) by the parties.  The paragraphs designated Findings of Fact Nos. 38 through 42 include legal conclusions as well as factual findings based on evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reference is made to the statement of facts by Parker, J., in his opinion for the Court of Appeals, for a full and accurate summary of the stipulated (admitted) facts and of the findings to which Railway Company excepted.  Restatement at length is deemed unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based upon the findings of fact set forth therein, and in accordance with his stated conclusions of law, Judge Olive adjudged the ordinances valid.  He ordered that Railway Company construct the required automatic signal devices and place them in operation within four months from the date of judgment; that City reimburse Railway Company &quot;for one-half (1/2) of the cost of installation of such automatic signal devices at each crossing, up to a maximum of $ 5,000.00 for each crossing&quot;; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and that Railway Company &quot;shall thereafter maintain said signals. . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In appealing to the Court of Appeals, Railway Company assigned errors based on its exceptions (1) to certain of the findings of fact set forth in the paragraphs designated Findings of Fact Nos. 39 through 42, (2) to each and all of the conclusions of law set forth in the judgment, and (3) to the judgment itself.  Upon appeal, the judgment was affirmed.  4 N.C. App. 11, 165 S.E. 2d 751. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Parker, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the July-August 1968 Criminal Session of Wayne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant appeals from a judgment sentencing him to death, the jury having found him guilty of murder in the first degree and having made no recommendation that his punishment be imprisonment for life.  The defendant entered a general plea of &quot;not guilty&quot; and further pleas of &quot;not guilty&quot; on the grounds of insanity and of &quot;temporary or transitory insanity at the time of the alleged commitment of the act.&quot; The indictment, verdict and judgment were all proper in form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regular panel of jurors having been exhausted, additional prospective jurors were summoned.  The record discloses no defect in or objection to the procedure followed in so doing.  Neither the State nor the defendant exhausted available peremptory challenges.  There is no suggestion in the record that any member of the jury which rendered the verdict was not competent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following is a summary of the evidence introduced by the State:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catherine (Kathy) Carr, age four years, was living in Smithfield, Johnston County, with her maternal grandmother on 16 December 1967.  The defendant was her stepfather.  He lived near&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Smithfield, separate and apart from the child's mother, who lived in Durham.  Prior to the separation they had all lived together at the defendant's home near Smithfield, the defendant demonstrating normal affection for Kathy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 5 p.m. on 16 December 1967, the defendant drove his station wagon to the home of the grandmother and told her that he wanted to take Kathy to see her mother in Durham.  They located Kathy at the home of a neighbor, picked her up and returned to the grandmother's home, where the grandmother assembled a change of clothing for the child.  The State introduced in evidence various articles of clothing after the grandmother identified each as either worn or carried by Kathy when she left the grandmother's home in the company of the defendant at approximately 6 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grandmother, an experienced hospital nurse's aid, who had worked with mental patients, observed nothing unusual about the defendant while she was with him when he so came to get Kathy.  He then appeared to her to be &quot;normal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 9:45 p.m., the defendant drove up to and entered a restaurant in Smithfield.  His clothing was disarranged.  He went to the rest room and remained there about&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  five minutes.  When he emerged therefrom with some adjustment of his appearance, he purchased a coca cola, drank some of it, went out to his station wagon, opened the door to it, returned to the restaurant and announced that someone had kidnapped his child.  He made conflicting statements as to where the child had been in the vehicle.  At that time the defendant &quot;acted normal&quot; in the opinion of a police officer who was in the restaurant.  Spots of blood were observed in the vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigating officers warned the defendant of his constitutional rights.  (On voir dire examination, an officer testified that the full </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warning was given to the defendant, the defendant stated he would talk to the officers &quot;without a lawyer being present,&quot; and there were no threats or inducements made or given the defendant in order to elicit a statement.  The court found as a fact that any statement made to such officers by the defendant was &quot;made freely, understandingly and voluntarily after full and complete warning of all rights guaranteed to said defendant under the State and Federal Constitution, without threat, promise of reward, coercion, duress or any other undue influence.&quot;) Thereafter, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on 17 December, the defendant drew and gave to the investigating officers a map, showing the location of the place where Kathy's body was buried.  This map was introduced in evidence.  At that time the officers did not know where the child or her body was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using the map or diagram so prepared by the defendant, the officers, together with the defendant, then drove to a point on a rural road in Wayne County, 18 miles from the defendant's home, from which point they walked 75 yards into a pine woods.  There the defendant pointed to a spot and told the officers the child's body was buried there.  The diagram, so prepared by the defendant, was an accurate portrayal of the route from Smithfield to this point.  An abundance of pine needles on the surface at the place so indicated by the defendant made the area compatible in appearance with the surrounding area so that a passerby would not have recognized this as a grave.  Kathy's body was found two feet below the surface at this point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photographs of the area, the opened grave and the child's body and articles of clothing in the grave were introduced in evidence and used by an investigating officer to illustrate his testimony, each photograph&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  being duly identified as to its accuracy.  Other photographs of the child's body, properly identified and authenticated, were introduced in evidence and used by the State's witnesses to illustrate the condition of the body, wounds thereon, the condition of the clothing and profuse blood stains thereon.  The articles of clothing, previously identified by the child's grandmother, were identified by the investigating officers as being upon the body or otherwise in the grave when the body was discovered.  The court instructed the jury at the time the photographs were offered in evidence that they were not substantive evidence but were allowed only for use to illustrate the testimony of the witnesses, if the jury found they did so illustrate such testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State also offered in evidence a shovel found at the defendant's home and taken therefrom by the officers with the defendant's permission on 18 December, immediately after Kathy's body was removed from the burial place.  The shovel then had upon it soil of the same type as the soil in the shallow grave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 18 December (having been given again the full </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warning concerning his constitutional rights), the defendant made&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a detailed statement to the officers concerning the events of the afternoon and evening of 16 December.  At the time of making the statement, he did not appear &quot;to be in a highly nervous condition.&quot; The officer to whom the statement was made testified that the defendant then told the officer that he left the grandmother's residence with Kathy in his car and took her to his own residence, where they were alone.  He then undressed the child and had intercourse with her despite her screams and struggles.  Using a washcloth (such bloody cloth having been found upon the child's body upon her removal from the grave), he cleaned the blood from her person and dressed her.  He then got his shovel, placed it in the station wagon, led Kathy out and put her in the station wagon, drove with her to the place where her body was found buried (18 miles from his residence), took the shovel, proceeded into the woods, dug the grave, went back to the station wagon and &quot;led Kathy Carr by the hand&quot; to the grave, where he &quot;took his hands and choked her to death.&quot; He then placed her in the grave and covered her, spreading pine needles over the grave so it would be &quot;hard to recognize,&quot; drove back to Smithfield, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  went into the restaurant, went back out to his car, returned to the restaurant and told the people Kathy had been left in the car and was &quot;gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 19 December, Kathy's body was examined by an expert in pathology, who testified as such.  This witness testified that in his opinion the child &quot;had suffocated to death as the result of being strangled or the hand or some other object being placed over the mouth and nose.&quot; He further testified that in his opinion, based upon his examination of her body, her vaginal tract had been penetrated by a male organ and had been severely lacerated and torn in the process, using photographs above mentioned to illustrate his testimony.  (The court again instructed the jury that the photographs were allowed in evidence for no purpose other than that of illustrating the testimony of the witness, they not being substantive evidence.) This witness also identified certain articles of clothing and the washcloth, previously introduced in evidence by the State, as having been found upon Kathy's body by him at the time of his examination on the morning of 19 December, and stated that their condition at the time he saw them in the courtroom was the same as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at the time of his examination of the child's body.  He testified that in his opinion the blood on the washcloth came from the above mentioned &quot;tear or laceration&quot; of the body of Kathy Carr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following is a summary of the evidence introduced by the defendant:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant testified to the effect that he was 27 years of age and had served a term in prison for armed robbery prior to his marriage to Kathy's mother.  Upon his release from prison he &quot;felt depressed and worried.&quot; He separated from Kathy's mother about six weeks prior to Kathy's death.  He then &quot;was becoming worried, depressed and moody&quot; and &quot;felt like&quot; he was losing his &quot;grip mentally as well as physically.&quot; He loved Kathy.  When he took Kathy from her grandmother's home on 16 December, he &quot;was feeling very depressed, very worried and up-set over the situation&quot; between him and his wife.  Leaving the grandmother's home with Kathy, he took her to his home where he decided to give her a bath before taking her to her mother.  Kathy then asked him when she and her mother could come back to live with him.  He replied that he did not know if they could or not.  She kept asking him and he &quot;yelled at her and told her to hush.&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She began to cry and he spanked her lightly.  She cried harder and he &quot;went out of [his] mind.&quot; He does not remember what happened from then until he found himself back in his home, except for &quot;impressions, flash glimpses of what happened&quot; or what he thinks happened in those two hours.  He drew the map above mentioned showing the location where he thought Kathy was buried.  He took the officers to the grave but does not &quot;remember clearly&quot; that he actually buried Kathy.  He did not spank her hard enough to make her bleed.  He did not tell the officer that he raped Kathy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant's mother testified that when he came out of prison he was &quot;very nervous&quot; and, in May, 1967, &quot;he seemed to be in a worried and troubled state of mind.&quot; On his last visit to his mother, prior to 16 December 1967, &quot;he appeared to be in a very, very nervous state.&quot; In her opinion, on 16 December &quot;he was incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong in relation to the charge of murder&quot; and he did not know right from wrong at the time she was testifying.  She, herself, was convicted and served a sentence for the murder of her second husband.  (The defendant's father was her first husband.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other witnesses&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for the defendant testified that he was &quot;good&quot; to Kathy, &quot;his character and reputation was very good&quot; and he was a good worker on his job.  Several of these witnesses, including relatives of the defendant, testified that they observed no indication of insanity in his conduct.  One of them, the defendant's parole officer from the time of his release from prison on the sentence of armed robbery until approximately two months prior to 16 December 1967, testified that in his opinion the defendant &quot;knew right from wrong&quot; when he came under the supervision of the witness, that he did so on 16 December 1967 and still did so at the time of the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to trial, pursuant to an order duly issued, the defendant was sent to one of the State's hospitals for the insane for 60 days for observation.  The examining psychiatrist was called as a witness for the State in rebuttal.  He testified, as an expert witness, that he saw the defendant at intervals during the defendant's stay at the hospital from 1 April 1968 to 6 June 1968, and in the opinion of the witness the defendant &quot;was sane during the time that he was confined to Cherry Hospital.&quot; From his study of the defendant during that period, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it is his opinion that the defendant &quot;was sane&quot; and &quot;knew right from wrong&quot; on 16 December 1967, and knew &quot;right from wrong&quot; at the time the witness was so testifying at the trial.  At the time the defendant was in the hospital, he had an I.Q. rating of 121, the normal rating being from 90 to 115.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the examination of prospective jurors three of them stated of their own volition that they do not &quot;swear.&quot; One of the three said he would like to be &quot;affirmed.&quot; The other two made no statement as to affirmation.  In each instance the court excused the juror &quot;in the exercise of its discretion.&quot; The record shows an exception to each of these actions of the court but no objection at the time of the court's ruling.  In oral argument counsel for the defendant stated that he did not interpose an objection at the time.  The record discloses no questioning of or challenge to any of these three prospective jurors by either party.  There is nothing in the record to indicate that any of the three would or would not have been acceptable either to the State or to the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the objection of the defendant the court sustained the State's challenge of prospective juror Corum.  After explaining&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the nature of the case to this prospective juror, the solicitor asked:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;In the event that you are sworn as a juror in this case, and in the further event that the State of North Carolina should furnish you with sufficient evidence in this case which in your opinion warranted a verdict of 'Guilty of Murder in the first degree,' do you or would you have any moral or religious scruples against bringing out a verdict of 'Guilty,' if you knew the penalty for that verdict would be death?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospective juror answered that he would have such scruples.  The solicitor then asked:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Then is your feeling so strong about that, or are your scruples, whether they be religious or moral so strong that in no event you could ever bring out a verdict of guilty if you knew the penalty would be death?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospective juror again answered in the affirmative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court then asked the solicitor, &quot;Do you mean in this particular case?&quot; and the solicitor replied that he did.  The challenge was thereupon sustained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over objection by the defendant the solicitor's challenge for cause of prospective juror Thompson was allowed.  The solicitor asked this prospective juror:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;In this particular&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  case, after you have heard all of the evidence for the State and the evidence for defendant, if the evidence of the State should convince you beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty, do you have any moral or religious scruples against bringing in a verdict of guilty in this particular case if you knew that the death penalty would be invoked?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospective juror replied that he did have such scruples and had had such scruples ever since he could remember.  The challenge was thereupon allowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the objection of the defendant the State's challenge of prospective juror Best was allowed.  The solicitor asked this prospective juror:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Mr. Best, if you are sworn as a juror in this particular case and if after having heard all of the evidence the State has satisfied you beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty, would you and do you have any religious or moral scruples that would prevent you from bringing out a verdict of 'guilty' if you knew the sentence would be death?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospective juror replied that he did have such scruples and had had them ever since he had been old enough to understand.  Thereupon the challenge was allowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  contains no other questioning of prospective jurors or statement concerning their selection except the following:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;There were 50 prospective jurors called to the stand before a jury was seated in this case and every juror called to the stand was asked the similar questions as set out above concerning capital punishment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourteen jurors, including two alternates, were selected.  The record does not show how many of the remaining 36 were challenged for cause, or for what cause, or peremptorily by the State or how many were so challenged by the defendant.  It was conceded in oral argument that neither party had exhausted its peremptory challenges when the selection of the jury was completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the course of the solicitor's argument to the jury, counsel for the defendant objected to the solicitor's statement, &quot;His mother said she didn't remember whether she was charged with killing her first husband or not.&quot; The court replied, &quot;I remember distinctly that she said it.&quot; The defendant contends that this was an unauthorized expression of an opinion by the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grounds upon which the defendant seeks a new trial are these: (1) The allowance of the State's challenge for cause&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the prospective jurors who expressed objections, as above shown, to capital punishment; (2) the court's excusing upon its own motion the prospective jurors who refused to be sworn, as above shown; (3) the overruling of the defendant's objections to the introduction in evidence of the photographs, the clothing and the bloody washcloth found upon the body of Kathy Carr and the shovel, above mentioned; (4) the court's permitting the expert pathologist to testify with reference to the child's having been raped and his use of photographs, above mentioned, to illustrate his testimony; (5) the court's permitting the psychiatrist to testify that the defendant knew right from wrong at the time of the alleged offense, during the time the psychiatrist observed the defendant and at the time of the trial; and (6) the statement of the court, above shown, concerning the testimony of the mother of the defendant.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant sought review of the judgment of a Wayne County (North Carolina) trial court, which convicted him of first degree murder and sentenced him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant challenged, inter alia, the trial court's allowance of the State's challenge for cause to prospective jurors who expressed objections to capital punishment and the trial court's excusal on its own motion of jurors who refused to be sworn. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that the record disclosed no error in the rulings of the trial judge upon challenges for cause by the State as a result of the prospective jurors' stated views on capital punishment. The court reasoned that the State, as well as the defendant, was entitled to a jury which would give it a fair and impartial verdict upon every issue properly presented by the evidence, including the question of whether the defendant should be executed or should be imprisoned for life. The court found no error in the trial court's excusing, in its discretion and on its own motion, three prospective jurors who refused to take the customary oath because it was the right and duty of the trial court to see that a competent, fair, and impartial jury was empaneled; to that end, the trial court, in its discretion, could excuse a prospective juror without a challenge by either party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which convicted defendant of first degree murder and sentenced him to death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals from judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hobgood, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the September 1968 Non-Jury Civil Assigned Session, Superior Court of Wake County.  Thereafter, plaintiff petitioned that the case be certified for transfer to the Supreme Court before determination by the Court of Appeals.  We allowed the petition pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 7A-31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff conceded at the trial, following an audit and after certain adjustments, that no relief was due it upon its original complaint.  Defendant asserted a counterclaim based on the audit, and the contest is now confined solely to defendant's right to recover thereon.  The facts, most of which have been stipulated, may be summarized as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff is a Delaware corporation with its principal office in Atlanta, Georgia.  It is engaged in the business of interstate transportation of petroleum products by pipeline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant is the Commissioner of Revenue of the State of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. During October, November and December of 1962 and April and May of 1963, plaintiff purchased large quantities of steel pipe to be used in the construction of a petroleum products pipeline in the State of North Carolina. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  4. The purchases of steel pipe were made in states other than North Carolina, and, under the terms of purchase, title to said pipe passed to plaintiff at points of origin outside North Carolina.  The costs of transporting said pipe into North Carolina were paid by plaintiff.  The suppliers billed plaintiff for the full amount of the sales price but allowed a discount therefrom only in case plaintiff paid for the merchandise within a specified period of time.  In many instances, plaintiff availed itself of this discount by paying the bills within the specified time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Plaintiff filed timely use tax reports for the months of October 1962 through May 1963 and made timely use tax payments to the State of North Carolina for said months as follows:</SPAN></P>

On or about April 7, 1966, the defendant, after hearing, denied said application for refund.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Defendant conducted an audit of plaintiff's records whereby it was determined that plaintiff had underpaid its sales and use tax to the State during the period of October 1962 through May 1966.

This left an unpaid balance on the claim of the State in the amount of $ 28,503.33, representing the State's asserted use tax on transportation charges and cash discounts for said period.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">You are hereby notified that an assessment for sales/or use tax, plus penalty and interest is proposed to be made against you in the amount indicated above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">This assessment is proposed pursuant to G.S. 105-241.1.  If you desire a hearing before the Commissioner of Revenue on this assessment, the request for such hearing must be submitted in writing to the Director of the Sales and Use Tax Division within 30 days after the date on which this notice was mailed or, if served upon you by a representative of the Commissioner of Revenue, within 30 days after the date of such personal service.  The application for hearing Must Be Made In Writing and must set forth in detail the bases for your objections&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  to the assessment.  Unless such application for hearing is filed within the time stated, this proposed assessment shall become final and conclusive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The audit on which this notice of assessment was based was amended January 9, 1967, to indicate that the balance due for said period was $ 63,014.32, and a copy of the amended audit was furnished plaintiff on that date.  Defendant waived the penalties previously asserted and plaintiff paid the adjusted assessment except the portion based on transportation charges and cash discounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Defendant asserts in his counterclaim that $ 21,609.69 is due as use tax on transportation charges and $ 6,893.64 is due as use tax on cash discounts, a total of $ 28,503.33.  These sums constitute the full net amount now at issue in this case exclusive of interest.  The total figure is not in dispute, but plaintiff contends the entire amount is illegal and uncollectible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Plaintiff and defendant have stipulated that if the transportation charges and cash discounts are properly includable in the North Carolina use tax base, then plaintiff has underpaid its use tax liability to the State for the period October 1, 1962, through May 31, 1966, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the sum of $ 28,503.33; in which case, defendant is entitled to recover that amount plus interest as provided by law, subject only to such adjustments, if any, as may be required by any applicable statute of limitations.  If such transportation charges and cash discounts are not properly includable in the North Carolina use tax base, then plaintiff has paid in full its use tax liability to the State for the period in question and defendant is not entitled to recover anything in this action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff contends (1) that imposition of the use tax on transportation charges places an unequal burden on interstate commerce and contravenes both the State and Federal Constitutions; (2) that imposition of the use tax on cash discounts is not authorized by G.S. 105-164.3(4); and (3) that more than three years elapsed after the date upon which a tax return was required by law to be filed and before an assessment was made and therefore that portion of the claim based on transactions prior to November 16, 1963, is barred by the three-year statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jury trial was waived by both parties.  The trial court heard oral testimony in addition to the stipulations, found facts and made&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  conclusions of law.  Judgment was thereupon entered decreeing that plaintiff's action be dismissed and that defendant Commissioner of Revenue have and recover of plaintiff the sum of $ 28,503.33 with interest thereon as provided by law and court costs.  From this judgment plaintiff appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The taxpayer purchased large quantities of steel pipe outside of the state, to be used in the construction of a pipeline in the state. The taxpayer paid use tax to the commissioner, and later sought a refund for an alleged overpayment based on a cash discount. The trial court dismissed the taxpayer's action, and awarded the commissioner the unpaid taxes associated with the transportation costs of the pipe. The taxpayer appealed, and the court held the judgment in error, holding that while the transportation charges were properly included in the use tax base, the cash discount should have been deducted from the full amount of the sales price and excluded from the use tax base. The court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect;105-164.6(1) and 105-164.3(4) meant that a use tax at the rate of 3 percent of the actual cost, as distinguished from the initial sales price, should have been assessed with no deductions allowed for cost of materials used, labor or service costs, transportation charges, or any other expenses. The court also held that certain assessments were barred by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-241.1(e) because the assessments were made more than 3 years prior to the return.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A comprehensive zoning ordinance of Guilford County divides all of the county, outside the zoning jurisdictions of incorporated municipalities, into nine districts, including the A-1 Agricultural District, as to which the ordinance provides:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">Section 1-3: &quot;A-1 Agricultural District.  Primarily for agricultural purposes with provisions for single family residences and mobile homes and two family residences on large lots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">Section 5-1: &quot;The A-1 Agricultural District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for general agricultural purposes.  In promoting the general purposes of this ordinance the specific intent of this Section is: to encourage the continued use of land for agricultural purposes; to prohibit scattered commercial and industrial uses of land; to prohibit any other use which would interfere with an integrated and efficient development of the land for more intensive use as the county population increases; and to discourage any use, which because of its character or size, would create unusual requirements and costs for providing public services, such as law enforcement, fire protection, water supply and sewage&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  disposal before such services are generally needed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lester O. Jones applied to the County Board of Adjustment for a special exception permitting him to establish a mobile home park with capacity for 25 mobile homes upon land owned by him in the A-1 Agricultural District.  The board fixed a time for a hearing upon the application and gave notice thereof.  The appellants and others appeared before the board at such hearing and testified in opposition to the application, they being the owners of residences in the district and contending that the establishment of the proposed mobile home park would adversely affect the values of their properties and would injuriously affect the further development of the area as a residential community.  The board, accompanied by the parties, viewed the proposed site and the surrounding area.  It then issued its order containing its findings of fact and granting the special exception applied for, subject to certain conditions not presently material.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only provisions in the ordinance specifically referring to the establishment of a mobile home park anywhere in the county are in Sections 3-10 and Article IV.  Section 3-10 provides:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;A mobile&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  home park may be established as a special exception in certain districts as prescribed by Article IV of this ordinance subject to the following conditions:&quot; (Then follows a series of detailed specifications concerning the site plan, dimensions of the park and of each mobile home space therein, driveways, parking spaces, recreation space, and the like, plus a provision for any other reasonable requirements, necessary to accomplish the purpose of the ordinance, which the Board of Adjustment may specify.)</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article IV of the ordinance is a detailed tabulation of permitted uses of land within the several districts.  It provides that within certain districts, including the A-1 Agricultural District, permitted uses include:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Mobile home parks </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c43">as a special exception</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">, subject to the provisions of Section 6-13B and operated in accordance with the provisions of Section 3-10 and the Guilford County Board of Health's regulations relating to the establishment and operation of mobile home parks.&quot; (Emphasis added.)</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 6-13B authorizes the Board of Adjustment to grant special exceptions &quot;in accordance with the principles, conditions, safeguards, and procedures specified in this&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ordinance, or to deny special exceptions when not in harmony with the purpose and intent of this ordinance,&quot; but then provides that such an exception shall not be granted by the board unless a written application therefor is submitted, a public hearing is had following a notice thereof and &quot;the Board shall make a finding that it is authorized and empowered to grant a special exception under the section of this ordinance described in the application </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">and that the granting of the special exception will not adversely affect the public interest</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot; (Emphasis added.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 7-1 of the ordinance provides:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;In their interpretation and application the provisions of this Ordinance shall be held to be the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c43">minimum requirements</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> for the promotion of the public safety, health, convenience, prosperity, and general welfare.  * * * All variances and special exceptions granted by the Board of Adjustment and all terms, conditions, and obligations imposed by the Board of Adjustment shall be binding as though explicitly provided in this Ordinance.&quot; (Emphasis added.)</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 7-2 of the ordinance provides:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Should any section, sentence, clause or phrase of this Ordinance be held invalid&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  or unconstitutional by the Courts, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Ordinance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 1-1 of the ordinance states its over-all purpose as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;The zoning regulations and districts as herein set forth have been made in accordance with a comprehensive plan and are designed to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to promote health and general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; and to facilitate the adequate provisions of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, and other public requirements.  These regulations have been made with reasonable consideration, among other things, as to the character of each district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses and with a view to conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the county.  Further, these regulations have been made with reasonable consideration for the expansion and development of each municipality within the county so as to provide for their orderly growth and development.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The order of the Board of Adjustment granting the special exception applied for was reviewed by the Superior Court of Guilford County upon certiorari.  Lupton, J., remanded the matter to the board for the reason that in its order it had not made a finding of fact that the granting of the special exception would not adversely affect the public interest, and directed the board to hold a further hearing and to make a finding of fact upon that question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereupon, the board held a further hearing, at which the applicant and the appellants introduced further evidence.  The board then issued its second order, finding as a fact that &quot;the granting of the special exception to permit Lester O. Jones to construct a mobile home park as applied for will not adversely affect the public interest&quot; and granting the special exception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matter was again reviewed by the Superior Court of Guilford County upon certiorari.  Crissman, J., entered judgment overruling all of the appellants' exceptions to the order of the board and affirming its order.  This judgment of the superior court recites that when the matter came on for hearing in that court the appellants asserted that the order of the board&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  should be vacated for three reasons: (1) There was not sufficient evidence before the board to sustain its finding that to grant the special exception will not adversely affect the public interest; (2) the board put upon the appellants the burden of showing that the public interest would be adversely affected; and (3) the delegation to the board of authority to grant special exceptions is &quot;an unlawful and unconstitutional delegation of power and authority to the Board of Adjustment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the judgment of Crissman, J., the appellants appealed to the Court of Appeals, assigning as error, among others, the holding that the delegation to the board of authority to grant special exceptions was constitutional and lawful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the superior court, its opinion being reported in 2 N.C. App. 408. The appellants thereupon appealed to this Court, asserting that the provision of the ordinance purporting to confer upon the board the authority to grant a special exception is a delegation of legislative power in violation of Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution of North Carolina.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">A property owner applied to the board of adjustment for a special exception to establish a mobile home park on land zoned for agriculture. The board granted the exception, but the superior court remanded the matter to the board because the board had failed to find that granting the request would not adversely affect the public interest. The board heard the application and again granted the exception, and found that the public interest would not be adversely affected. The court of appeals affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the lower courts. The court noted that zoning authority was an exception to the general rule that legislative authority could not be delegated to an agency. The court held that the portion of the statute which granted to the board the authority to determine whether the application was in the public interest exceeded the authority of the county commissioners to delegate to the board. However, the court ruled that, since the statute provided that the county would have passed the rest of the ordinance anyway, and because the application could have been granted without the illegal finding, the court affirmed the decision to grant the exception.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant was first charged by warrant in the Municipal County Court of Greensboro for operating a motorcycle upon the city streets without wearing the required safety helmet.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Superior Court the Grand Jury returned a true bill charging that the defendant operated a motorcycle on the public highway without wearing a protective helmet, in violation of G.S. 20-140.2(b).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant appealed a judgment of the COURT OF APPEALS OF NORTH CAROLINA, which affirmed his conviction for operating a motorcycle on the streets and highways of the State without wearing an approved safety helmet in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-140.2(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant had filed a motion to quash the indictment on the ground that the statute creating the offense violated his rights under N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 and under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Defendant contended that the statute regulated his private conduct without any showing of public interest or purpose that promoted or contributed to public health, morals, safety, or welfare. He conceded that he had no defense to the charge if the general assembly had the constitutional power to pass the statute. The court upheld the conviction and the constitutionality of the statute. The requirement that defendant wear a safety helmet bore a real and substantial relationship to public safety. The general assembly, therefore, had ample authority, under its police power, to enact the statute and to make its violation a criminal offense. The court's decision was fortified by many similar state statutes, triggered by the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1381 et seq. The Act of Congress and the regulations promulgated under its authority were applicable to travel in interstate commerce. The same highways carried both interstate and intrastate travel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiffs from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Copeland, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, April 8, 1968 Session, Rockingham Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs, residents and taxpayers who, on and prior to September 12, 1967, had resided within the limits of Leaksville, Draper or Spray, instituted this civil action against the named defendants for the purpose of challenging the validity of Chapter 967, Session Laws of 1967, which purported to authorize the consolidation of the named municipalities, together with Meadow Greens Sanitary District, into a single municipality.  The specific boundaries of the new city were set out in the consolidation act.  The consolidation was conditioned on voter approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election was held as provided.  A majority of the votes in all units was cast for consolidation.  &quot;Eden&quot; was selected as the name of the consolidated municipality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Act provided that if the voters approved the consolidation the four municipalities were abolished, all their properties, rights, duties and obligations were transferred to and assumed by the new city.  All ordinances, franchises, etc. in effect before the consolidation were to be observed.  All officers and employees were to continue until their successors were&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  chosen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long before Chapter 967 was enacted, the Eden Metropolitan Sewerage District was in operation as a municipality.  It was not abolished.  The plaintiffs' amended complaint alleged, and the answer admitted, the following:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;70. Eden Metropolitan Sewerage District is a municipal corporation incorporated pursuant to N.C. G.S. 153-297.  The sewerage District had, and has, as one of its functions, the disposal of sewage for the area comprising Leaksville, Draper and Spray, but neither had nor has any function insofar as the area comprising the Meadow Greens Sanitary District is concerned.  The Sewerage District has a large outstanding bonded indebtedness of at least $ 2,000,000.00 secured by the power of the Board of the Sewerage District to levy taxes within only the areas which comprised Leaksville, Draper and Spray and, with the tax revenues therefrom derived, to pay the indebtedness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of the consolidation, the taxpayers of the Metropolitan Sewerage District (Leaksville, Draper and Spray) were taxed for city purposes and also for the payment of Metropolitan's outstanding obligation.  All other taxpayers of the City of Eden were exempt from liability for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Metropolitan's indebtedness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs attacked the constitutionality of Chapter 967, Session Laws of 1967, upon the grounds: (1) That House Bill No. 1139 was not passed on three several readings in each House of the General Assembly and was not agreed to by each House respectively, as required by the State Constitution; and (2) The failure to abolish the Eden Metropolitan Sewerage District and transfer its obligations to Eden had the effect of relieving property in Meadow Greens and in the area outside the former limits of Leaksville, Draper and Spray from tax liability for the Metropolitan Sewerage District debts.  Section 8 of Chapter 967 contains this provision:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Nothing in this Act shall be deemed or construed to affect in any manner the Eden Metropolitan Sewerage District of Rockingham County, North Carolina, or to affect in any manner any rights or obligations, including outstanding indebtedness, of the Eden Metropolitan Sewerage District of Rockingham County, North Carolina.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs allege the lack of tax uniformity in the City of Eden, resulting in failure to abolish Metropolitan, and to require Eden to assume its debts, violate Article V, Section&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  3, Article II, Section 14, of the North Carolina Constitution, and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs prayed for relief: (1) That Chapter 967, Session Laws of 1967, be declared void; (2) That the municipalities of Leaksville, Draper, Spray and Meadow Greens Sanitary District be restored to their former status; (3) That their former officials be required to resume their former duties and to render a proper accounting to their former municipalities; and (4) That the defendants be restrained from expending any tax funds and from performing any duties or functions in the name of the City of Eden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties waived a jury trial and agreed that Judge Copeland should hear the evidence, find the facts, state his conclusions of law and render judgment.  After hearing and review of the House and Senate Journals, the certificates of presiding officers of both the House and Senate, Judge Copeland made these findings:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;1. That this action was instituted by the plaintiffs to challenge the validity and to prevent the enforcement of House Bill No. 1139, as enacted as Chapter 967 of the 1967 Session Laws of the General Assembly of North Carolina, entitled&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  'An Act to Authorize an Election on the Question of Consolidation of the Town of Draper, the City of Leaksville, the Town of Spray, and the Meadow Greens Sanitary District as a Single Municipality.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">2. That on September 12, 1967, the Town of Draper, the City of Leaksville, and the Town of Spray were duly incorporated municipalities under the laws of North Carolina and had been for many years, and that Meadow Greens Sanitary District was a duly incorporated sanitary district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">That on said date the Town of Draper, the City of Leaksville, and the Town of Spray did not own a sewage treatment plant; and that untreated sewage from said municipalities was emptied into the Dan River and another river.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">4. That on September 12, 1967, an election was duly held in said municipalities and in the adjoining central area pursuant to Chapter 967 of the 1967 Session Laws of the State of North Carolina, with notice of such election having been duly published in accordance with the provisions of said Act, for the purpose of determining whether said areas should have a single consolidated municipal government; . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">5. That Chapter 967 of the 1967 Session Laws of the General&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  Assembly of North Carolina was duly and lawfully enacted into law by the North Carolina General Assembly, same having been read three several times in each House of the General Assembly and passed on three several readings, which readings were on three different days, with the yeas and nays on the second and third readings having been entered on the journal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">6. That Eden Metropolitan Sewerage District is a municipal corporation incorporated pursuant to North Carolina N.C. G.S. 153-297, and same is a separate legal entity and it was not included within the area to be consolidated into a single municipality as provided by Chapter 967 of the 1967 Session Laws of the General Assembly of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">7. That in the incorporation of the City of Eden, all the requirements of the North Carolina and United States Constitutions and of all applicable State and Federal laws have been duly and fully complied with in all respects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court concluded as a matter of law, and adjudged:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;1. That House Bill No. 1139, enacted as Chapter 967 of the 1967 Session Laws of the General Assembly of North Carolina was duly adopted in accordance with the provisions of the North Carolina&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  and United States Constitutions, and in accordance with all applicable State and Federal laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">2. That, under the facts as found and under the allegations as contained in the pleadings filed in the cause, the City of Eden, North Carolina, has been duly incorporated and now exists as a municipal corporation of the State of North Carolina in compliance with all lawful requirements.</SPAN></P>

The residents contended that the bill violated the rule of uniformity. The superior court found that the bill was properly enacted and was not unconstitutional. The court held that the residents' would have to look to the legislature for any remedy. The superior court's finding that the bill was enacted as required by N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 14 was supported by the journals of the North Carolina House and Senate. The rule of uniformity under N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 3 was not violated by double taxation resulting from taxes levied by different authorities if each authority adhered to the uniformity rule in its levies. The legislature had the sole power to create municipal corporations; whether the sewerage district's obligations should have been assumed by the new municipality or left undisturbed was within legislative, not judicial, competence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 16 October 1967 defendant was tried in the Recorder's Court of Thomasville upon five warrants charging him with the following offenses: (1) operating a motor vehicle on a public street in Thomasville while under the influence of intoxicants, (2) disorderly conduct and creating a disturbance by cursing and using profanity and indecent language in a loud and boisterous manner in the presence of divers people while on a public street in the City of Thomasville, (3) hit and run doing property damage of $ 100 or more, (4) public drunkenness, and (5) resisting arrest and assaulting an officer.  Attorney Charles F. Lambeth, Jr., privately employed, represented him.  The judge of the Recorder's Court dismissed the charge of hit and run but found defendant guilty on the other four charges.  Judgments were pronounced as follows: On the charge of operating a motor vehicle on the public streets of Thomasville while under the influence of intoxicants, twelve months in prison suspended for two years on condition defendant (a) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be of good &quot;character&quot; and violate no laws, (b) spend three nights in the city jail from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., (c) not drive a motor vehicle for twelve months, and (d) pay a fine of $ 100 and costs.  In the other three cases prayer for judgment was continued on condition defendant comply with the judgment above set out and pay the costs in the case in which defendant was found guilty of resisting arrest and assaulting an officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant gave notice of appeal to the Superior Court of Davidson County in all four cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Superior Court the State took a nol pros on the charges of disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and assaulting an officer, and public drunkenness.  Defendant was placed upon trial on the charge of operating a motor vehicle upon a public street while under the influence of intoxicants.  Defendant, appearing without counsel, entered a plea of not guilty.  A jury of twelve was duly empaneled, and evidence was offered by both the State and defendant as hereinafter set out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show that on 24 September 1967 George Burton, a police officer of the City of Thomasville who was off duty at the time, saw defendant leave a nearby house, stagger&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  down the steps, and enter a white 1959 Chevrolet parked on the left side of the street.  An elderly man, who was later a witness for the defendant, came out of the same house and got in the car as a passenger.  Defendant started the car, attempted to go forward and killed the motor.  He cranked up again and struck some mailboxes on the left curb as he drove away.  He was &quot;kind of weaving&quot; and driving on the left side of the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Burton directed his wife to call the police and then followed defendant in his own personal car.  He momentarily lost sight of defendant in the traffic but shortly came upon the white 1959 Chevrolet, bearing the license number he had previously noted, parked in a driveway beside a house.  He stopped and was joined by Officers Smith and Batten who arrived in a patrol car.  Defendant's wife answered their knock on the door and invited the three officers into the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside the house Officer Burton told defendant the people were angry because their mailboxes had been knocked down and requested defendant to do something about them.  Defendant was highly intoxicated, became very belligerent, cursed the officers and called Officer Batten a &quot;white&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  s.o.b.&quot;, and told them to leave his house.  He continued cursing them as they left and followed them into the street where Officer Smith placed him under arrest.  He was charged in five separate warrants as above detailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, as a witness in his own behalf, testified he was driving his motor vehicle on the day in question and struck the mailboxes referred to by the officers but denied he was under the influence of intoxicants.  Defendant's wife testified that he had been home about 45 minutes when the officers arrived; that when they knocked defendant invited them in; that defendant was practically asleep but not drunk.  W. C. Henderson testified that he and defendant were together on September 24 and defendant did not appear to be under the influence or drinking.  He said defendant took him home that day but didn't have any liquor.  He admitted that he and defendant were &quot;old drinking buddies.&quot; Defendant called Officer Smith as a defense witness.  This officer's testimony corroborated that of the two officers who testified for the prosecution.  He stated that he and Officer Batten arrived at defendant's home within 10 minutes after receiving the call; that defendant was under&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the influence of intoxicants when they arrived and was still drunk several hours later in the jail when defendant's wife came to bail him out, and that defendant was kept in jail overnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury convicted defendant of driving a motor vehicle on a public street while under the influence of intoxicants, and the judge imposed an active prison sentence of 18 months.  Defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals and was represented before that tribunal by privately employed counsel.  That Court upheld his conviction and sentence, 2 N.C. App. 262, 163 S.E. 2d 108, and defendant in apt time appealed to the Supreme Court asserting violations of his constitutional rights in four particulars as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution and under Article I, Secs. 11 and 17, of the State Constitution his rights were violated in that the trial court failed to advise defendant (a) of his right to retain counsel, (b) of his right to have counsel appointed for him if he could not afford counsel, and (c) of the possible adverse consequences of standing trial without counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution and Article&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I, Sec. 17, of the State Constitution his rights were violated in that the trial court failed to adequately aid defendant in the presentation of his defense without counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Under the Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution and Article I, Secs. 11, 15 and 17 of the State Constitution his rights were violated in that the trial court admitted (a) statements made by the defendant to police officers when said officers had not advised defendant of his Fifth Amendment rights and (b) the testimony of police officers based on information obtained by illegal search and seizure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution and Article I, Sec. 17, of the State Constitution his rights were violated in that defendant received a greater sentence in the superior court than he received in the Recorder's Court of Thomasville.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-138. He asserted violations of U.S. Const. amend. IV, V, VI, XIV and N.C. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 11, 15, 17.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant was convicted of a general misdemeanor for which a first time offender could be imprisoned for two years. On appeal, he asserted that under U.S. Const. amend. VI, XIV and N.C. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 11, 17, his right to counsel was violated. He also claimed that his rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV, V, XIV and N.C. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 11, 15, 17 were violated by the admission of his statements that were made without his being advised of his Fifth Amendment rights and on the testimony of police officers based on information obtained by illegal search and seizure. The court held that defendant had been charged with a serious offense and had a constitutional right to the assistance of counsel during his trial.  N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-4.1, insofar as it left to the discretion of the trial judge the appointment of counsel for indigent defendants charged with serious offenses, was unconstitutional. The conviction was reversed because the trial judge failed to determine indigency and appoint counsel to represent defendant if indigent. The court remanded for a new trial. The court found no evidence of a search or seizure, and the sentence was proper.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 27 February 1968 plaintiff instituted this action against defendants to restrain the collection of ad valorem taxes upon real property acquired and held by plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff alleged in his complaint that it is a duly created redevelopment commission, existing under the provisions of Article 37, Chapter 160, of the General Statutes of North Carolina.  Plaintiff is engaged in the public business for which it was created and organized and has acquired fee simple title to certain real property for the purposes of redevelopment pursuant to Article 37, Chapter 160, of the General Statutes, consisting of the following basic types: (1) improved income-producing, (2) improved non-income-producing, and (3) unimproved income-producing, and (4) unimproved nonincome-producing.

That Court adjudged that the nonincome-producing property held by plaintiff was exempt from taxation and that the income-producing property was subject to ad valorem taxes, and thereupon reversed the judgment sustaining the demurrers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">On appeal, the court sought to determine whether the court of appeals erred, in holding as a matter of law that real property acquired and held for redevelopment pursuant to the North Carolina Urban Redevelopment law was not exempt from taxation if it produced income. The court found that the equitable remedy of injunction was proper because the property owner contended that the taxing body was without authority to impose the tax because of the constitutional exemption. The court held that the property owner alleged sufficient facts from which it might have been reasonably inferred that all of the property held by the property owner was acquired and held primarily for governmental and public purposes according to a definitely evolved plan to use the property for the public. The collection of rent while the property was being held for a public or governmental purpose was incidental and secondary to the dominant public use and did not remove it &quot;from the city hall&quot; to &quot;the market place.&quot; The court of appeals erred in holding, as a matter of law, that the income-producing property held and acquired for redevelopment purposes was not exempt from taxation because it produced income.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Review upon certiorari of order, entered 21 November 1966 by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Mallard, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, dismissing petitioner's application for a writ of habeas corpus and post-conviction review under G.S. 15-217&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the July 1953 Session of the Superior Court of Wake, defendant pled guilty to charges of feloniously breaking and entering the building occupied by Brawley Jewelry Company of Raleigh and of stealing and carrying away therefrom watches valued at $ 5,400.50.  The two counts were consolidated for judgment, and defendant received a sentence of &quot;not less than ten years nor more than eighteen years&quot; in the State's prison.  He escaped from prison on 7 December 1953, but was apprehended in Ohio and returned on 25 November 1964.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, under G.S. 15-217&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, defendant petitioned the Superior Court to vacate his sentence because he was not represented by counsel at the time he entered his plea of guilty.  Judge C. W. Hall allowed his petition, set aside his plea and sentence, and ordered a trial de novo.  Upon retrial at the November 1965 Session, defendant entered a plea of not guilty.  The State offered evidence before the jury; defendant did not.  The verdict was &quot;guilty of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  breaking and entering as charged and guilty of larceny as charged.&quot; Upon the count of breaking and entering, the judgment was that defendant be imprisoned for not less than seven nor more than ten years; upon the count of larceny, for not less than six nor more than eight years, this sentence to begin at the expiration of the one imposed on the first count.  The court ordered that defendant be credited with all time served prior to 11 October 1965 in execution of the sentence imposed at the July 1953 term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant appealed to this Court, assigning as error the admission in evidence of his confession and the failure of the court to allow his motion of nonsuit.  We found no error in the trial.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">State v. Stafford</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 267 N.C. 201, 147 S.E. 2d 925 (filed 4 May 1966).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 21 November 1966, defendant addressed to Honorable Raymond B. Mallard, the judge then presiding over the Superior Court of Wake County, the last of several petitions for his release or post-conviction review of his trial.  He averred (1) that he had been awarded and subjected to a new trial over his vigorous protest, and (2) that the sentence which he received at the second trial was illegal because it exceeded by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  three years the sentence at the first trial.  Judge Mallard found -- as the record conclusively establishes -- that the new trial had been awarded at defendant's insistence and after Judge Hall had fully explained to him &quot;the risk incident thereto.&quot; Judge Mallard found defendant's petition to be without merit and denied his application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 22 June 1967 defendant filed with this Court a petition for certiorari in which he asserted that a sentence in excess of the one received at his first trial could not constitutionally be imposed at the second trial.  Certiorari was allowed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Petitioner was found guilty of breaking and entering and larceny, which was affirmed by the court on review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Petitioner received a prison sentence, he escaped, and later was brought back to prison. Thereafter, his petition to vacate his sentence was allowed, and he obtained a trial de novo, where his was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to a term greater than the first trial. On appeal of a dismissal of his habeas corpus petition, the court held that the increased sentence did not deprive petitioner of due process of law because the case was tried de novo, and therefore, the prior judgment did not fix the maximum punishment available after a second conviction. Moreover, the court determined that petitioner 's due process rights were not violated because there was no evidence that the trial judge vindictively punished petitioner for asserting his rights. The court also found that petitioner 's double jeopardy rights were not violated because he suffered no detriment from the vacated sentence. Finally, the court rejected petitioner's claim that he was denied equal protection of the law because he was of a class that was subjected to an increased sentence. The court held that all defendants who obtained a trial de novo assumed the risk of an increased sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On certiorari to the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State on the relation of the Commissioner of Insurance brought this civil action in the Superior Court of Wake County to recover $ 3,000, the amount of a civil penalty imposed by the Commissioner of Insurance upon the defendant for violations of the insurance laws of the State, found by the Commissioner to have been committed by the defendant.  From a judgment in favor of the plaintiff the defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the superior court.  1 N.C. App. 208. The defendant petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari to review the decision of the Court of Appeals, asserting in the petition that G.S. 58-44.6, under which the Commissioner imposed the penalty, violates the Constitution of North Carolina in that:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">(1) It violates the constitutional requirement of a separation of the executive, judicial and legislative powers of the government of the State;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">(2) It confers upon the Commissioner of Insurance a discretion, subject to no guiding rules or standards, to impose a civil penalty not in excess of $ 25,000.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The material allegations of the complaint filed in the superior court are, in substance: &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  <BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">Prior to 16 January 1967, the defendant was duly licensed by the State as an insurance agent and broker.  On that date the Commissioner caused to be served upon the defendant notice of certain charges of violations by him of the insurance laws of the State and of a hearing to be held on 26 January by the Commissioner to determine whether the defendant's licenses should be revoked permanently and a civil penalty imposed on account of such alleged violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">In accordance with such notice, a hearing was held by the Commissioner at which the defendant was represented by counsel, and at which evidence was introduced both by the Department of Insurance and by the defendant.  On 6 April 1967, the Commissioner rendered his decision and issued his order, which is attached to and made part of the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">The order contained detailed findings of fact setting forth numerous violations by the defendant of the insurance laws of the State.  The order also contained conclusions by the Commissioner, upon such findings of fact, that the defendant had wilfully violated G.S. 58-47, had dealt unjustly with and wilfully deceived persons in regard to insurance policies, had wilfully procured insurance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  in &quot;an unauthorized foreign or alien company,&quot; had neglected to make and file documents required by G.S. 58-53.1, and had failed to comply with certain requirements of chapter 58 of the General Statutes, &quot;by virtue of which the licenses of James Abner Vines are subject to suspension or revocation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">Upon such findings of fact and conclusions, the Commissioner ordered that all licenses theretofore issued to the defendant to act as an insurance agent and broker be permanently revoked, and that the defendant &quot;pay to the State of North Carolina a civil penalty in the amount of $ 3,000.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Commissioner is entitled, after notice and hearing, to impose a civil penalty not to exceed $ 25,000, from which imposition the aggrieved party may appeal to the Superior Court of Wake County.  The defendant has not so appealed from the order of the Commissioner and the time for taking the appeal has expired, so that the order has become final.  The Commissioner has made demand upon the defendant for payment of the penalty so imposed upon him but the defendant has failed and refused to pay it.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant filed answer admitting the foregoing allegations of the complaint, except that the authority&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Commissioner to levy a civil penalty was denied for the reason that G.S. 58-44.6 is in violation of the Constitution of the United States and of the Constitution of North Carolina.  The answer does not specify by article and section the provision of either constitution relied upon by the defendant, but alleges that this statute purports to confer upon the Commissioner &quot;the unbridled discretionary right to inflict civil penalties up to the sum of $ 25,000,&quot; is discriminatory and is an unlawful delegation of legislative and judicial powers, in violation of both the Constitution of the United States and of the Constitution of North Carolina.  The answer further alleges that the State, upon the relation of the Commissioner of Insurance, is not the real party in interest and so cannot maintain this action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the call of the case for trial in the superior court, the defendant demurred ore tenus upon the ground that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for that G.S. 58-44.6 &quot;contravenes both the Constitution of the State of North Carolina and the Constitution of the United States.&quot; In the demurrer, as in the answer, the defendant did not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  cite, by article and section, the provision of either constitution relied upon by him.  The demurrer was overruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence for the plaintiff consisted of the notice of hearing, the statement of charges and the order of the Commissioner, including his findings of fact and conclusions thereon.  It was stipulated that the notice and statement of charges were duly and properly served upon the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No finding of fact or conclusion by the Commissioner is controverted in this action and the validity of so much of the order as revokes permanently the licenses theretofore issued to the defendant is not challenged, the only contentions being that the Commissioner had no authority to impose the civil penalty and that the plaintiff is not the real party in interest, for which reasons the defendant contends this action to collect the penalty so imposed cannot be maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the evidence for the plaintiff, the defendant moved for a judgment of nonsuit on the ground that the action was not instituted by the real party in interest as required by G.S. 1-57.  This motion was denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The superior Court made its own findings of fact, in summary as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">(1) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  The penalty was imposed by the Commissioner pursuant to G.S. 58-44.6 after notice and hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">(2) The Commissioner issued an order and decision finding, among other things, that the defendant, a licensed insurance agent, had violated various sections of chapter 58 of the General Statutes, had unlawfully negotiated for and collected premiums for insurance policies issued by companies not licensed to do business in North Carolina, and had dealt unlawfully with and had deceived persons in regard to insurance policies; the Commissioner permanently revoked the licenses of the defendant and imposed a civil penalty in the amount of $ 3,000, to be &quot;finally discharged and satisfied upon payment to the Treasurer of the State of North Carolina&quot;;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">(3) The defendant did not appeal from the order and decision of the Commissioner and it became final;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">(4) After demand upon the defendant for payment, the Commissioner filed this action in the superior court to compel the defendant to pay the penalty; the defendant answered the complaint, alleging that G.S. 58-44.6 is unconstitutional in that it is an unlawful delegation of legislative and judicial powers to the Insurance Commissioner, and the defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  also contended in oral argument that the Commissioner is not the real party in interest to bring this action.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon these findings of fact, the superior court concluded that the statute is not unconstitutional, does not violate Art. I, &sect; 8, of the Constitution of North Carolina and does not constitute an unlawful delegation of legislative authority or of judicial powers; the statute contains adequate safeguards for due process of law and for the imposition of a civil penalty; this action is properly brought by and in the name of the Commissioner of Insurance by the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The superior court accordingly ordered and adjudged that the defendant pay to the Treasurer of the State $ 3,000 and pay the costs of the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his appeal to the Court of Appeals, the defendant assigned as error the overruling of his demurrer ore tenus, the denial of his motion for judgment of nonsuit and the signing of the judgment.  The Court of Appeals found no error in any of these respects.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant appealed the order of the North Carolina Court of Appeals affirming plaintiff's judgment for $ 3,000, the amount of a civil penalty imposed by the Commissioner of Insurance, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 58-44.6, upon the defendant for violations of the state insurance laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff, the state insurance commissioner, obtained a judgment for $ 3,000, the amount of a civil penalty imposed by the plaintiff upon the defendant pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 58-44.6 (statute) for violations of the insurance laws. The court of appeals affirmed. Defendant contended the statute violated the state constitution. The court reversed and remanded. Under N.C. Const. art. IV, &sect; 3, the legislature could confer judicial power only if reasonably necessary as an incident to the accomplishment of the purposes for which the Department of Insurance was created. Here, there was no reasonable necessity for conferring upon plaintiff the judicial power to impose upon a monetary penalty, varying, in the plaintiff's discretion, from a nominal sum to $ 25,000 for each violation. Therefore, the penalty was not lawfully asserted and was not due and owing from plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the trial court's exclusion of the testimony proffered by defendant. The court reversed the appellate court's decision.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dan Williams Rigby, a resident of Iredell County, died testate on 17 March 1964, owning property within North Carolina having an appraised value of $ 110,021.49 and real property in South Carolina having an appraised value of $ 61,000.00.  Plaintiff, executrix and sole beneficiary of the will of Dan Williams Rigby, filed an inheritance tax return as executrix with defendant Commissioner of Revenue.  In the return she took all state deductions and exemptions and paid inheritance tax on the North Carolina property, without any reference to the South Carolina property.  Defendant assessed an additional tax on the North Carolina property by establishing a rate pursuant to G.S. 105-21.  Plaintiff paid the additional tax under protest and duly filed claim for refund.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The classification, which the executor attacked as arbitrary and capricious lay in the difference in the method of arriving at the rate of tax applied to heirs or legatees receiving property from estates consisting of property lying both within North Carolina and outside of North Carolina, as distinguished from the method of arriving at the rate of tax applied to heirs or legatees receiving property from estates consisting of property lying wholly within North Carolina. The court of appeals affirmed the superior court's judgment denying relief to the executrix. On further appeal, the court concluded that the classification was not so wholly arbitrary and unreasonable as to be beyond the legislative authority of the state. The court recognized the prevailing law that a state could levy inheritance or succession taxes on property within its authority at a rate, which considered the entire estate (a part of which was located outside the state) in arriving at the amount of the tax.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">In 1966, Pamlico County followed a new procedure in compiling the jury list and took names from the voter registration books as well as from the tax books. In 1967 a new statewide procedure was established, but it took effect after the drawing of the grand juries that returned defendants' indictments. Defendants sought unsuccessfully to quash the indictments, claiming that blacks were systematically excluded from the jury list. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the use of tax lists as a source of names to be placed upon the jury list did not render illegal a grand jury drawn from the box, even though the tax lists separated black and white taxpayers or otherwise designated their respective races. The court found that defendants had failed to make out a prima facie case of unconstitutional discrimination because they had not shown repeated substantial discrepancies between the number of blacks drawn for grand jury duty and the number anticipated based on the number in the source materials. Lastly, the court found that the lists were compiled based on an effort to take names from both races in approximate proportion to the number of each race on the tax books.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff from a judgment entered by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Ervin, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at April 15, 1968 Regular Schedule &quot;A&quot; Civil Session of Mecklenburg, certified, pursuant to G.S. 7A-31, for review by the Supreme Court before determination by the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff seeks to have declared void as violative of Article V, Section 3, and of Article V, Section 5, of the Constitution of North Carolina, the 1967 Act entitled, &quot;An Act Enabling Mecklenburg County to Hold a Special Election for the Purpose of Considering Whether the County Shall or Shall not Impose and Levy a Sales and Use Tax of One Per Cent Upon the Sale, Use and Other Taxable Transactions Upon Which the State now Imposes a Three Per Cent Sales and Use Tax,&quot; being Chapter 1096, Session Laws of 1967.  He prays that defendants be enjoined from enforcing its provisions and from collecting the tax imposed thereby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause came on for hearing before Judge Ervin on March 7, 1968, on plaintiff's motion for an interlocutory order restraining defendants until the final determination of the action.  At said hearing, the City of Charlotte applied for and was granted permission to intervene as a party defendant.  The verified complaint was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the only evidence.  Decision was deferred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 28, 1968, separate demurrers to the complaint were filed (1) by defendant Clayton, Commissioner of Revenue, and (2) by defendants Martin, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et al.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, County Commissioners of Mecklenburg.  On April 2, 1968, a demurrer to the complaint was filed by defendant City of Charlotte.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judgment for defendants was entered by Judge Ervin at April 15, 1968 Civil Session.  It contains no reference to any of said demurrers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings of fact which Judge Ervin incorporated in his judgment and the factual allegations of the complaint are identical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final portion of the judgment is as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Based upon the foregoing findings of fact, the Court makes the following conclusions of law:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. That the plaintiff is not entitled to the injunctive relief sought in this action because he and the other interested persons on whose behalf this action has been brought have an adequate remedy at law through the use of G.S. 105-406 and related statutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. That, even if the plaintiff does not have an adequate remedy at law in accordance with the preceding paragraph, the Court concludes as a matter of law that the tax authorized by Chapter 1096 of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the 1967 North Carolina Session Laws, which tax has been approved by the voters of Mecklenburg County, is constitutional and that this action should therefore be dismissed on its merits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Based upon the foregoing conclusions of law, It Is Hereby Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed that this action be, and the same hereby is dismissed with the costs to be taxed to the plaintiff.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried upon a bill of indictment charging him with the murder of his wife Kathren Ralph Colson on 3 August 1967.  The solicitor sought a verdict of guilty of murder in the second degree or manslaughter, as the evidence might disclose.  The jury convicted defendant of manslaughter, and a prison sentence of 12 to 15 years was imposed by the court.  Defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals where his conviction and sentence was upheld, 1 N.C.App. 339.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case is now before us on appeal, defendant alleging involvement of substantial constitutional questions by reason of (1) an illegal search of his person and seizure of his clothing; and (2) an illegal search of his house and seizure of an empty Jacquin's Vodka bottle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence -- defendant offered none -- tended to show that defendant's wife was stabbed to death at her home in Elizabeth City on the night of 3 August 1967.  Police officers went to the home in response to a telephone call from defendant's son received at approximately 12:30&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a.m. on 4 August 1967.  They were admitted by the son Willard Colson, Jr., and found the deceased in a slumped position on a settee in the living room with her head on the armrest.  Examination revealed a stab wound in her chest which penetrated the heart and large vessels leading to the lungs.  A search of the house at that time revealed a butcher knife approximately twelve inches long on the counter in the kitchen with blood on the blade.  Blood spots were also found on the bed clothing and sheets in the bedroom and on the rugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant arrived at the house at approximately 1:30 a.m. just as the body of his deceased wife was being placed in a hearse.  He was highly intoxicated, smelled of alcohol and was staggering.  He walked up and asked the chief of police: &quot;Chief, what's wrong?  Has she had a heart attack?&quot; The chief of police replied: &quot;No, she did not have a heart attack; she has been stabbed.&quot; The defendant then asked: &quot;What with, a butcher knife?&quot; During this conversation defendant was not in custody and was not being questioned by the officers.  The chief of police then requested defendant and him son to accompany him to the police station, and they did so voluntarily. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defendant was given the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warning at the police station, after which he told the officers he had gotten off work and arrived home about 5 o'clock p.m. on the preceding afternoon; that his wife had been drinking and provoked an argument, though there was no argument between them; that he left the house about 6 p.m., at which time his wife was lying sprawled out on the settee; that he went to the liquor store and purchased a pint of liquor and just drove around drinking it; that the butcher knife found in the kitchen of his home was his, but he expressly denied that he had ever cut his wife or that he knew who had done it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the foregoing statement and during a general conversation at the police station, defendant offered to show the officers a scar on his stomach.  When he opened his shirt, the officers saw blood on his undershirt and asked defendant if they might see the rest of his underclothes.  Defendant voluntarily exposed his undershorts to view at which time blood was observed on them.  When he was asked by the officers and by his son how the blood got on his underclothing, defendant did not answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A serologist testified that the blood of the deceased was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  type &quot;AB&quot; and the blood on defendant's undershirt and undershorts was type &quot;AB,&quot; while defendant's blood was type &quot;O&quot;.  This witness further stated that he had made an examination of the blood spots on the garments of the deceased, on the sheets in the bedroom, and on the butcher knife, and all were found to be type &quot;AB&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's clothing -- T shirt, undershorts, dungarees and shirt -- was taken from him by the police between 2:00 and 2:30 a.m. on 4 August 1967.  At this time he was being detained at the police station for questioning but had not yet been placed under arrest.  A warrant was not obtained until sometime between 8:30 and 9:00 a.m. on the morning of 4 August 1967, as soon as a magistrate was available to issue it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant remained at the police station from the time he arrived at approximately 1:30 a.m. until about 9:30 a.m. the same morning when he accompanied the officers on a return to his home to see if any other evidence which might have been overlooked the previous night could be located.  The officers requested permission to enter the home for that purpose, and defendant, offering no objection, entered with them.  Upon making a further search, an empty&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  pint Jacquin's Vodka bottle was found under a chest of drawers in the bedroom.  An employee of the County ABC Board testified that defendant bought a pint of vodka from him on the evening of 3 August 1967 between 7:15 and 8:00 p.m., and identified the bottle found in the bedroom as having been sold from his register on 3 August 1967.  The bottle, and the testimony concerning its discovery, was admitted into evidence over objection by defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's motion for nonsuit at the close of the State's evidence was overruled.  The jury found defendant guilty of manslaughter, and from a judgment of imprisonment defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals, where his conviction and sentence was upheld, and then to this Court assigning errors as noted in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant was charged and convicted of the stabbing death of his wife. Defendant challenged the legality of the search of his person and his house, and the seizure of his clothing and an empty vodka bottle. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that the appellate court committed no errors. The court first held that because substantial constitutional questions regarding the Fourth and Fifth Amendments were presented, it had the right to review all assignments of error allegedly committed by the intermediate appellate court. The court found that the seizure of defendant's clothing was not entitled to constitutional immunity because defendant voluntarily exhibited his bloody clothing to the police. Thus, there was no search. Further, clothing was not subject to Fifth Amendment protection. The court found no error in the questions the trial judge asked certain witnesses because they were meant to clarify and they did not prejudice defendant. The court refused to decide the issues relating to testimony about the vodka bottle and the search of defendant's bedroom because they were not raised in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action by plaintiffs-taxpayers for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause was heard by Judge Peel (1) on the application in plaintiffs' amended complaint for a temporary restraining order; (2) on defendants' demurrer to the amended complaint; and (3) on defendants' motion to strike designated portions of the amended complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pertinent to their application for a temporary restraining order, plaintiffs offered affidavits, including the verified complaint; and defendants offered affidavits and exhibits, including original and revised budgets for 1967-1968 and excerpts from minutes of meetings of the Board of Commissioners of Washington County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Peel's order, after setting forth his findings of fact and conclusions of law, (1) denied plaintiffs' application for a temporary restraining order &quot;pending the final hearing of this matter on its merits&quot;; (2) overruled defendants' demurrer; (3) denied defendants' motion to strike; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and (4) allowed defendants thirty days in which to file answer.  Plaintiffs and defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals from the portions adverse to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The portion of Judge Peel's order denying plaintiffs' application for a temporary restraining order, which was challenged by plaintiffs' appeal, was affirmed.  The portions of Judge Peel's order, challenged by defendants' appeal, were reversed; and, in respect thereof, it was held that defendants' demurrer should have been sustained and the action dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their notice of appeal, plaintiffs specified, in accordance with Rule 3 (as amended April 30, 1968) of the Supplementary Rules of this Court, that the substantial constitutional question directly involved was whether the action of the Board of Commissioners plaintiffs seek to restrain is in violation of Article VII, Sec. 6, of the Constitution of North Carolina.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">On review, the taxpayers alleged that the applicable statutes required approval by the electorate before the board was authorized to levy a tax on property to supplement teachers' salaries.

The court found that whether the board of commissioners of a county could be authorized, where necessity was shown by a county board of education or peculiar local conditions demanded, to add or supplement items of expenditure in the current expense fund, including additional personnel and/or supplements to the salaries of personnel, and to make a sufficient tax levy to provide the funds therefor, either with or without the approval of the voters of the county, was a matter for determination by the state general assembly. The court concluded that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115-80(a) was a valid exercise of legislative authority and the challenge to its validity on the asserted ground that it was violative of N.C.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioners, William Harris Nichols, David Edward White, and Francis Paul White, were jointly tried at the 20 June 1966 Mixed Session of Pitt upon a bill of indictment charging them (1) with feloniously breaking and entering the Harris Supermarket of Greenville on 18 March 1966, and (2) with having in their possession without lawful excuse implements of housebreaking, to-wit: a pry bar, two crowbars, one eight-pound sledge hammer, two punches and two chisels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the trial, Nichols, an indigent, was represented by M. E. Cavendish, attorney, whom the court appointed to defend him.  The other two defendants were represented by Milton C. Williamson, an attorney employed by them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence for the State tended to show: During the early morning hours of 18 March 1966, Sergeant R. B. Elks of the Greenville Police observed a 1955 Ford automobile containing three men stop at the front door of the Harris Supermarket.  The two passengers got out, and Elks saw&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the glass in front of the supermarket shake.  The front door popped open about a foot and a half, and the men immediately got back into the automobile without having entered the store.  The car was driven away.  Elks followed the car for about six blocks and stopped it &quot;about 1:52 a.m.&quot; upon the arrival of Officer Cannon, whom he had called for assistance.  David Edward White, the driver, and Francis Paul White were in the front seat; Nichols, in the back.  The three were arrested for breaking into the Harris Supermarket and placed in the police car.  Upon Elks' request, David White gave him the car keys so that the Ford could be moved.  Officer Cannon drove the car off the street and locked it.  The officers retained the keys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After taking the men to jail, Elks, Cannon, and three other officers returned to the Harris Supermarket.  There they observed marks on the metal door where it had been pried open.  Elks' testimony leaves the time of the officers' return to the supermarket uncertain.  He first said it was &quot;about 1:15 or 1:30.&quot; He then said &quot;it was sometime after 1:00, it was a short time.&quot; Later, he said it was &quot;shortly after 2:50.&quot; He also testified, however, that the automobile&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was moved to the police station about 30 minutes after the petitioners were taken to jail.  There it was searched by Elks, Cannon, and Officer Briley.  At that time, a warrant (presumably for breaking into Harris Supermarket) had been served upon the three petitioners.  Elks testified that the warrant was served &quot;about 1:00 a.m.&quot; In the automobile, the officers found gloves, tape, chisels, crowbars, hammers, a bag of corks, and several punches.  An eighteen-inch crowbar, wrapped in tape, was &quot;under the right side of the front seat&quot;; two crowbars were in the trunk.  &quot;A set of four gloves&quot; was found on the back seat and &quot;a set of two gloves&quot; under the right front seat.  In the trunk of the car was a bag containing an eight-pound sledge hammer, two chisels, and two punches.  In the glove compartment, the officers found friction tape and a bag containing a number of cork stoppers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the introduction of the foregoing evidence, none of the defendants made a motion to suppress it on the ground that it was obtained by a warrantless search.  The defendants did, however, interpose an objection to the admission into evidence of each item found in the automobile.  The objections were overruled, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and exceptions to the rulings entered in the record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence also tended to show: On 11 March 1966, David Edward White had called at the office of the Harris Supermarket and inquired if he could get his wife's check cashed there.  The manager, who was busy, asked him to wait, but he left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Nichols offered no evidence.  Defendants White offered evidence which tended to show: They are residents of Laurel, Maryland.  On 15 March 1966, David Edward White had rented the automobile in which he, his brother, Francis Paul White, and Nichols, a casual acquaintance, had taken a trip to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.  They spent Tuesday night at a truck stop in Virginia and arrived at Myrtle Beach the following day.  They did not sleep Wednesday night.  On Thursday morning, they left Myrtle Beach and were en route to Maryland when Officer Elks stopped them.  A few minutes before, David Edward White had attempted to awaken his two passengers so that one of them might take the wheel or help him stay awake.  When they got out of the car, however, each staggered to such an extent that he realized neither was in a condition to drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of their arrest, defendants&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (who had taken with them only the clothes they were wearing) had not opened the trunk of the rented car.  None of them knew that the tools were in the vehicle.  The automobile was searched without their permission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The week before, David Edward White, who operates a feed company at Laurel, Maryland, had been in North Carolina attempting to collect some past-due accounts.  During the trip he had investigated Greenville as a place to live; he had gone into Harris Supermarket &quot;to find out the procedures of living here, and operating with those procedures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found each defendant guilty as charged.  On the count of unlawful possession of implements of housebreaking, each received an active sentence to be served in the State's prison -- Nichols, 8-10 years; David Earl White, 5-7 years; Francis Paul White, 5-7 years.  Upon the count of breaking and entering, the judgment as to Nichols was confinement &quot;in the State's prison for not less than 8 nor more than 10 years, sentence to begin at the expiration of sentence imposed for possession of burglary tools.&quot; This sentence, however, was suspended for five years upon good behavior.  On the second count, both Whites received a sentence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of 5-7 years to begin at the expiration of the sentence imposed upon the first count.  These sentences were suspended upon the same conditions as those imposed upon Nichols.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nichols and Francis Paul White gave notice of appeal to the Supreme Court.  The latter, in open court and in writing, withdrew his appeal on 1 September 1966.  David Edward White did not give notice of appeal.  At the June Term 1966, M. E. Cavendish, at his request, was relieved as counsel for Nichols, and J. W. H. Roberts, attorney, was appointed to represent Nichols upon his appeal to the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nichols' appeal was docketed in this Court as Case No. 92 at the Fall Term 1966.  None of his six assignments of error related to the admissibility of the implements of housebreaking which the officers found in their search of the automobile.  That case on appeal was devoid of any indication that objection had been made to the admission of the evidence, and Nichols made no contention that the search was unlawful.  In a per curiam opinion, filed 21 September 1966, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">State v. Nichols</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 268 N.C. 152, 150 S.E. 2d 21, this Court found no error in the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October 1966, while serving the sentences imposed, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the three defendants filed petitions for post-conviction review under G.S. 15-217&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Each averred that his constitutional rights had been violated at the trial in that evidence procured through an illegal search and seizure had been used to convict him of the unlawful possession of implements of housebreaking.  No other grounds for relief were alleged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the representation of each that he was indigent, on 4 November 1966, the court appointed petitioners' present counsel, A. Louis Singleton, to represent them in the post-conviction proceedings.  At the 28 January 1967 Session of Pitt, the three petitioners, who were present in open court with their counsel, stipulated that their petition related only to their conviction on the count charging the possession of implements of housebreaking without lawful excuse, and that they were not asking that their conviction and sentence for storebreaking be vacated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his answer to defendants' petition, the solicitor for the State admitted that the search of the automobile in which petitioners were riding at the time they were arrested was without a warrant.  He denied, however, that the search was illegal.  Upon the hearing he contested&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  petitioners' right to relief upon two principal grounds: (1) Petitioners may not collaterally attack the legality of the search in post-conviction proceedings, since the correctness of the trial court's ruling, which admitted the evidence obtained by the search, was reviewable as an incident of the trial by direct appeal to the Supreme Court.  Petitioners White waived their right to question the judge's ruling by failing to appeal; Nichols waived his right by failing to raise the question upon his appeal.  (2) No search warrant was required since the search was made (a) as an incident of a lawful arrest for a felonious breaking which the officer had seen petitioners commit, (b) for the implements with which the breaking had been effected, and (c) as soon as possible after the two arresting officers had transported the three petitioners to jail, returned to the scene for their Ford and moved it to the jail, where it could be safely and more conveniently searched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transcript of petitioners' trial was introduced in evidence at the post-conviction hearing and is a part of this case on appeal.  It indicates that objections were duly made to the introduction of the seized items.  After&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  considering the transcript (the only evidence introduced at the hearing) and the argument of counsel, Judge Hubbard made findings in accordance with the facts as stated above.  Upon those findings, he held as a matter of law that: (1) the search of the automobile in which the petitioners were arrested was not made incident to the earlier arrest for breaking and entering and, being a warrantless search, was illegal; (2) the introduction into evidence of the items procured by the search was a substantial denial of petitioners' constitutional rights; (3) post-conviction proceedings provide an appropriate remedy to adjudicate the question which petitioners now raise; (4) none of the petitioners knowingly waived his constitutional rights, either at trial or subsequent to said trial; and (5) petitioners have the right to petition for redress as to one conviction without seeking a new trial on both counts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Hubbard thereupon entered judgment awarding petitioners a new trial upon the count charging the unlawful possession of implements of housebreaking and authorizing the release of each upon bond in the amount of $ 5,000.00.  (The Attorney General informs us that petitioners White gave&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the required bond, and that petitioner Nichols was delivered to the State of Maryland upon a detainer which that state had filed against him.) The State of North Carolina excepted to the judgment awarding petitioners a new trial and petitioned this Court for certiorari, which was granted.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The inmates were convicted of unlawful possession of implements of housebreaking and of breaking and entering. Two inmates appealed their convictions. Only one inmate pursued his appeal. In that appeal, the inmate never contended that a search leading to his arrest was unlawful. The inmates argued in their petitions for post-conviction review that evidence supporting their convictions was procured through an illegal search and seizure. The trial court granted the inmates a new trial, but the court reversed. A petition for post-conviction relief was not a substitute for a direct review of a conviction. Petitions under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 15-217 to 15-222, allowed the inmates to adjudicate claimed deprivations of constitutional rights which prevented them from obtaining a fair trial, provided factors beyond their control prevented them from claiming the deprivations earlier. The court held that errors in the inmates' trial which could have been reviewed on a direct appeal could not be asserted for the first time, or reasserted, in post-conviction proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Copeland, S.J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, June 1967 Non-Jury Assigned Civil Session of Wake, docketed and argued at the Fall Term 1967 as Case No. 534.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action to recover $ 600.00, the maximum benefit provided by a policy of hospital and surgical insurance issued to plaintiff by defendant.  The following facts were stipulated:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant corporation is engaged in the business of writing and selling hospital and surgical insurance in North Carolina.  On 12 November 1949, it issued to plaintiff its policy (No. R-409687), which was in force at all times relevant to this suit.  After the issuance of the policy, plaintiff contracted tuberculosis.  He was necessarily confined to Eastern North Carolina Sanatorium at Wilson (Eastern) from 10 August 1961 until 16 September 1961, and from 28 September 1961 until his final discharge on 23 July 1962, a total period of 336 days.  Plaintiff has complied with all policy requirements in respect to notice and proof of loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policy provisions applicable to hospital-expense benefits resulting from sickness provide:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Part I. If the Insured or any member of the Family Group shall be necessarily confined within a recognized Hospital as a resident&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  patient on account of such injury or such sickness, the Company will pay the Insured (or the Hospital if authorized by the Insured to do so) for the following items of hospital expense actually incurred but not to exceed the amounts stated below:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A. Hospital Room, including meals and general nursing care, not to exceed Six Dollars ($ 6.00) per day, for the period that the Insured or member of the Family Group shall be confined therein, but not to exceed One Hundred Days as the result of any one accident or sickness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Company will pay only the usual, customary and regular charges for the services and materials stated above, and the maximum amounts specified in this Part 1. . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the outside of the policy and also at the top of the first page above the label, &quot;Hospital and Surgical Expense Policy,&quot; and above defendant's name and address, there appears this notation: &quot;This policy provides benefits for loss due to hospital confinement and for other specified expense resulting from accidental bodily injury, sickness, or childbirth, to the extent herein limited and provided.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eastern is one of the four units of the North Carolina sanatorium system, in which tubercular&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  patients are accepted regardless of their financial condition.  Approximately two-thirds of all patients are certified by the counties as welfare patients and pay nothing for services rendered them.  The county in which the patient resides, however, pays the sanatorium sixty cents per day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During plaintiff's hospitalization, Eastern's charges were controlled by a resolution of the board of directors of the North Carolina sanatorium system, which provided in part: &quot;(2)(a) that the accrued total of the bill for regular medical and hospital services rendered to . . . in-patients . . . shall be computed at a standard rate of $ 10.00 per day, based on cost which exceeds the Sanatorium System's average per diem patient cost . . . and (3) that the following collection policy shall be applicable:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(A) No allowance shall be granted as a discount on the accrued total of the bill of any patient who is financially able to pay the total bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(B) An appropriate allowance, based on the patient's financial condition, shall be granted and applied as a discount on the accrued total of the bill of each patient who is financially unable to pay the full bill.  It is intended that discretion shall&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be exercised in analyzing a patient's financial condition and in determining an appropriate allowance.  If a patient has hospital insurance, it shall be considered as one of the several factors that make up his whole financial picture.  By taking all factors into consideration, including insurance, it shall be determined how much the patient is able to pay per day; then the allowance shall be set as the difference between (a) the accrued total of the bill and (b) the amount which the patient is able to pay.  The patient's financial condition shall be reviewed periodically and the allowance revised accordingly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties waived a jury trial.  Both plaintiff and defendant offered evidence which was without material conflict.  That offered by plaintiff tended to show: Plaintiff was admitted as a paying patient.  He was informed that he would be charged, and expected to pay, the standard rate of $ 10.00 per day, which all patients -- welfare, indigent and nonindigent -- are charged.  This charge was set by the board of directors after determining the average daily patient cost by dividing the total number of patient days into total sanatorium expenditures exclusive of physical improvements. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This actual cost was $ 10.16.  The $ 10.00-charge included room, meals, medical care, laboratory work, x rays -- everything.  Eighty-three percent of the charge, or $ 8.30, represented room and board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ledger cards are maintained for each patient, and all but welfare patients are billed monthly.  Welfare accounts are handled by billing the respective counties at $ .60 per day.  The difference of $ 9.40 appears on the patient's card as a balance due, but no effort is made to collect it from the welfare patient unless he thereafter becomes able to pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All patients, when they enter the hospital, are informed that they must pay the full $ 10.00-rate if they are able; if they are not, that they are expected to pay as much as they can, and that any unpaid balance will be a debt which they are expected to pay as soon as they are able to do so.  When a patient claims inability to pay the full charge, a financial statement is taken to determine the amount he can currently pay.  In determining a patient's ability to pay, Eastern's administrator considers a patient able to pay the amount for which he has insurance.  Only about five percent pay their total bill.  Eastern and the other sanatoriums&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the system are largely supported by appropriations made by the General Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eastern charged plaintiff $ 10.00 a day for 336 days.  He owes the hospital $ 3,360.00, no part of which has been paid, although bills have been sent to him and defendant periodically.  If defendant pays the amount of its policy, $ 600.00 will be entered as a credit on plaintiff's total bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's evidence, in addition to showing the facts detailed above, tended to show: The ledger card of each patient is totaled at the 15th of each month.  No effort is made to itemize charges or expenditures; all entries are at the $ 10.00 per day standard rate irrespective of the care required by the particular patient.  Collections are made on the basis of the patient's current ability to pay as determined by the hospital administrator after investigation.  Once this amount is determined -- be it $ 1.00, $ 5.00, or $ 10.00 -- the patient is periodically reminded of the payments he agreed to make.  On plaintiff's application for admission to Eastern, he listed his wife as his only defendant and his assets as follows: the hospital insurance policy in suit; railroad retirement income of $ 228.00 a month; real&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  estate, $ 20,000.00; household furniture, $ 3,000.00; Cadillac automobile, $ 4,000.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's motions for judgment of nonsuit, made at the close of plaintiff's evidence and again at the close of all the evidence, were denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Copeland found the facts to be in accord with those delineated above.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he specifically found: (1) During the 336 days plaintiff was a patient at Eastern, he was charged $ 10.00 a day, &quot;the usual, customary, and regular charges&quot; for the services he received.  (2) Of the standard rate of $ 10.00 a day, $ 8.30 was for meals, room, and general nursing care.  (3) Plaintiff actually incurred hospital expenses of $ 3,360.00 during his stay at Eastern.  Upon these findings, he adjudged that plaintiff is legally obligated and indebted to Eastern in the sum of $ 3,360.00.  Under its policy of insurance &quot;defendant is liable to plaintiff for hospital room expense benefits&quot; of $ 6.00 per day for 100 days, a total of $ 600.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From judgment that plaintiff recover of defendant the sum of $ 600.00 with interest at 6 percent per annum from September 15, 1962 until paid, defendant appealed.  </SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment against the insurer, holding that the policy covered expenses for which the insured was legally liable, regardless of whether he was able to pay. The court found that the insured was legally liable for the cost of his care.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record in this case was made at the hearing before the State Board of Assessment (State Board).  The following facts, supported by the evidence, are related here for a better understanding of the matters involved on this appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. About 1960 Reeves Broadcasting Corporation (Reeves) became the owner and developer of a large tract of land in Brunswick County known as the Boiling Spring Lakes property.  Over 6,000 acres are located in Town Creek Township and about 5,000 acres in Smithville Township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Real property in Brunswick County was last revalued for tax purposes in 1958, and the next revaluation year prescribed by G.S. 105-278 for Brunswick County was 1967.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Improvements were made to the land during 1959, 1960, 1961 and 1962.  Conferences were held between the taxpayer and Brunswick County and the assessed value of the property for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1962 was increased to $ 141,390 by agreement.  In 1964 certain additional improvements to the property were listed by Reeves bringing the assessed value to $ 150,750 for that year.  The County attempted to increase the assessed valuation for 1964 but due to a technicality, which was unexplained, reverted to the 1963 valuation and used it for tax purposes for 1964.  The changes made as of January 1, 1965 were the changes which the County attempted to make for 1964.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In 1963 and 1964 Reeves opened new areas and new streets and developed new sections.  It has spent $ 75,000 to $ 100,000 building a dam to form a large lake covering more than 100 acres and subdivided the area around the lake into more than 100 lots which have an average market value of $ 3,000 each.  It built a nine-hole golf course and a club house on the property at a cost of approximately $ 200,000.  There are approximately 37 miles of road in the development, some of which were built between 1962 and 1965.  Between twelve and fifteen maps are on record showing various areas being subdivided into lots.  All the land within the development, except the portion subdivided into lots, is on the tax books at a valuation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of $ 10 per acre.  Some of this acreage is being sold as 10-acre timber tracts at $ 149.50 per acre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In 1963 Reeves furnished the Tax Supervisor for Brunswick County a list showing the various sections under development, the number of lots in each section, and the value, or selling price, placed on each lot by the owner.  On the basis of that information Brunswick County attempted to make the 1964 listing but reverted to the 1963 values due to some technicality.  The values thus furnished in 1963 were followed in making the tax assessment for 1965 now under attack in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Real estate valuations for the year 1965 in Brunswick County were made under the supervision and direction of Mrs. Ressie R. Whatley, County Tax Supervisor.  In 1958 the property consisted primarily of swamp and woods and was listed at $ 10 an acre.  The 1963 and 1964 assessments were based on changes that had been made to and including 1962.  Many additional changes occurred during 1964 which prompted the reappraisal for 1965.  Mrs. Whatley went upon the property a number of times, riding through it in her car and looking it over.  She did not go out and walk over the property.  She observed it with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  respect to subdivision into lots and made a report to the County Board of Equalization and Review (County Board) with her recommendations in the form of a breakdown of values by the acre and by the lot.  The County Board inspected the property, accepted the recommendations of Mrs. Whatley and assessed the Reeves property for 1965, using the 1963 sales price figures furnished by the taxpayer as the appraised value of each parcel, tract or lot.  Recorded maps show a total of 4,174 lots in Town Creek Township and 905 lots in Smithville Township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The listing by Reeves Broadcasting Corporation for the year 1965, except for subdivided lots, is as follows:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. No lots around the big lake have been sold for less than $ 2,000.  The price for these lots has ranged from $ 2000 to $ 3800, averaging $ 3000, according to Charles A. Tate, Development Manager for Reeves.  Waterfront lots at Spring Lake were sold for $ 695, while those not fronting on the water were sold from $ 300 to $ 500.  Every lot which has been sold in every development is adaptable to the use for which it was sold.  Some of the lots shown on the maps are not salable in their present condition&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  but will require filling in before they can be sold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Brunswick County has endeavored to encourage developers of real estate within the county and has followed a system of placing fixed values on all real estate within the county and then giving a discount to a developer.  With the exception of Reeves Broadcasting Corporation, the County, after establishing the appraised value, then gives all developers a 35% &quot;depreciation&quot; so that in effect property under development is appraised at 65% of its market value.  Then an assessment ratio of 50% is applied to the depreciated value, the net result being that a developer's property is taxed at 32.50% of its appraised market value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because Reeves Broadcasting Corporation was a large, new development trying to get started, Brunswick County gave it special consideration in that appraised values were established for its property and then Reeves was given a developer's &quot;depreciation&quot; of 50% (instead of 35%), and then an assessment ratio of 50% was applied to such depreciated value, the net result being that its property was initially placed on the tax books at 25% of its appraised market value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In preparing the 1965 listing and values of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Reeves property, Brunswick County first appraised the lots at 65% of the advertised selling price, the value fixed by the taxpayer itself.  Then the 50% &quot;depreciation&quot; allowance was applied.  Then the property was actually assessed for taxation at 50% of the &quot;depreciated&quot; value, the net result being that the lots in the various subdivisions of the Reeves property were listed for taxes for the year 1965 at 16.25% of the advertised selling price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long Beach and its Tranquil Harbour division is the development in Brunswick County which most reasonably compares with Reeves.  In this development all lots shown on recorded maps are first appraised at 65% of the advertised sales price.  Then 35% of that figure is deducted as a &quot;depreciation allowance&quot;, and then each lot is taxed at 50% of this figure, the net result being that the lots are taxed at 21.13% of the advertised sales price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barbee's, Inc., James M. Harper, Jr.'s &quot;Deep Water Heights Subdivision of Southport&quot;, the R. I. Mintz &quot;River Heights Addition to the Town of Shallotte&quot;, Ocean Isle Development and Sunset Beach-Twin Lakes Development are all treated in the same basic manner as the Tranquil Harbour-Long Beach development. </SPAN></P>

After the tax supervisor and the County Board of Equalization and Review had assessed the Reeves property for 1965 as set out in paragraph 7 above, Reeves appealed to the State Board of Assessment assigning as grounds &quot;excessive and illegal valuation and discrimination in comparison with valuation of similar lands, the increase over the 1964 valuation was without legal authority, no competent appraiser has visited and observed the property in making the valuations from which this appeal is taken, . . . the increase in valuation is confiscatory and is an unconstitutional taking of private property for public use without due process of law, . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Board of Assessment &quot;gave careful consideration to all pertinent facts, evidence and testimony given by the taxpayer and the County&quot; and to the brief filed by the taxpayer, made certain findings set out in its order, and determined that &quot;the valuation of Section 16 of the property and such portions of Sections 8 and 9 as do not represent lots on streets which were open to travel on January 1, 1965, [nor on a lake front,] should be valued on an acreage basis and appraised at $ 10 an acre. . . .  [A]ny lots on swampy land&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not suitable for the use for which intended should be appraised at values which would reflect the cost of reclaiming the lots. . . .  [A]ppraised values placed on all other property of appellant by Brunswick County are proper.&quot; The State Board thereupon remanded the taxpayer's appeal to Brunswick County for action in keeping with such order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Reeves Broadcasting Corporation petitioned the Superior Court of Wake County for a judicial review of said order under G.S. 143-306&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> contending the State Board (1) exceeded its authority, (2) acted arbitrarily and capriciously, (3) placed an excessive valuation on the property which was unlawful and unequal when compared with similar property in Brunswick County, and (4) was erroneous in failing to adjudge that Brunswick County had followed an unlawful procedure in violation of the statutes in its 1965 reassessment of the property for taxation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the matter was heard before Judge Bailey at the August 1967 Civil Session of Wake County Superior Court, he made certain findings which, conjunctively, sustained the position of Reeves, vacated and set aside the reassessment of the property for the year 1965 and remanded the cause&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the State Board with directions that the 1964 valuation of said property be placed into effect for the tax year 1965.</SPAN></P>

Additional improvements were then made, and the county attempted to increase the assessments. The taxpayer argued that the county unlawfully placed an excessive valuation on the land. The superior court vacated and ordered the previous year's valuation of the property be placed into effect. The court reversed and remanded for compliance with the county's assessment. The court found that the valuation was favorable to the taxpayer and thus he was not aggrieved by the county's failure to strictly follow the statutes in assessing the property. The decision of the State Board of Assessment was supported by material and substantial evidence and was therefore binding on the superior court.

This case was docketed and argued as No. 773 at Fall Term 1967.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City of Durham instituted this proceeding to condemn and appropriate to the public use a tract of land owned in fee simple by defendants and known as 611 S. Roxboro Street in the City of Durham.  Plaintiff filed complaint and declaration of taking and notice of deposit on 5 April 1967, and deposited the sum of $ 8,650.00 in the Superior Court of Durham County as estimated compensation for the use of the persons entitled thereto.  At the same time, plaintiff filed for registration a memorandum of action with the Register of Deeds of Durham County as required by section 104 of Article 9 of Chapter 136 of N. C. General Statutes.  By order dated 24 April 1967, Judge Leo Carr allowed plaintiff's motion to amend its complaint and declaration of taking so as to allow plaintiff to elect to adopt the procedures provided in Article 9 of Chapter 136 of the General Statutes, as authorized by G.S. 136-66.3.  The record does not show that plaintiff filed a supplemental memorandum of action.  On 5 April 1967 defendants were served with summons in this&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  action, together with copies of the complaint, declaration of taking, which included the notification of the deposit of the estimated compensation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff offered in evidence affidavits which tended to show that defendants were given notice, by letter and personal contact from representatives of the City of Durham, that the City must acquire the property occupied by them because the same was a necessary part of an expressway project.  These notices commenced on 3 November 1966.  Defendants were told they would have to vacate by February 1967 and that assistance in relocation would be available to them.  In January 1967, a negotiator was hired by the property manager of the Public Works Department of the City of Durham to negotiate the purchase of defendants' property.  An official offer to purchase the property was sent to defendants by certified mail on 7 February 1967.  Defendants were notified that if they did not accept the City's offer to purchase the property, the property would be condemned by the City for the expressway project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 19 April 1967, plaintiff filed motion asking that the court enter an order requiring defendants to appear and show cause why they should not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be removed from possession of the premises.  Order was entered requiring defendants to appear on 20 April 1967 to show cause why they should not be removed from the premises.  On 25 April 1967, defendants petitioned the court to declare Chapter 136, Article 9, section 104 of the General Statutes of North Carolina unconstitutional, and further prayed that the court not hear plaintiff's pending motion to show cause.  By order dated 1 May 1967 Judge Walter Bone adjudged section 104, Article 9, Chapter 136 of the General Statutes to be constitutional, and further ordered that defendants vacate the premises at 611 S. Roxboro Street in the City of Durham on or before 31 May 1967.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action by plaintiffs to restrain the enforcement of an ordinance of the City of Charlotte (City).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 12 December 1966, for the stated purpose of protecting the general health, safety, welfare, and morals of the area, City enacted &quot;An Ordinance Licensing and Regulating Massage Parlors, Health Salons and Similar Establishments.&quot; In brief summary, the ordinance provides: Any person desiring to engage in business as a masseur or masseuse, or to operate an establishment wherein physical treatment or manipulation of the human body is carried on, must first obtain a license from the city council.  For the purposes of the ordinance, any person who applies either mechanical or manual massage to the body is deemed to be a masseur or a masseuse.  Every applicant for a license must show good health and good moral character and produce either a diploma from a school of physical culture or proof that he or she has had at least two years of practical experience in a duly licensed massage or physical-culture studio.  If the applicant is a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  corporation, its employees must meet the foregoing requirements.  Licensees must file with the police department the names and addresses of all their employees and must keep, available for police inspection, accurate records of the names and addresses of all their patrons.  No masseur, masseuse, or establishment licensed under the ordinance may engage in business except between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. It shall be unlawful for any masseur, masseuse, or other licensee to treat an individual of the opposite sex except upon the signed order of a licensed physician, osteopath, or registered physical therapist.  Such order must specify the number of treatments prescribed, the date and hour of each, and the name of the operator who will give each treatment.  It is unlawful for a person under the age of 21 to receive treatment at any massage parlor or similar establishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By express provision, the ordinance does &quot;not apply to a regularly established and licensed hospital, sanitarium, nursing home or medical clinic, nor to the office or clinic operated by a duly qualified and licensed medical practitioner in connection with his practice of medicine, provided, however, that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such office or clinic is regularly used by such medical practitioner as his principal location for his practice of medicine; nor shall the provisions of this article apply to health club activities of the Young Men's Christian Association or the Young Women's Christian Association; nor shall the provisions of this article apply to duly licensed barber shops and beauty shops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs allege that the occupation of masseur and masseuse is an ordinary lawful and innocuous business which has no effect upon the public health, safety, welfare, or morals; that the ordinance is an unreasonable and invalid exercise of the police powers of the City of Charlotte in that (1) the ordinance prohibits plaintiffs from engaging in their respective businesses and deprives them of a livelihood because -- in the main -- their patrons are men; and (2) the exemptions arbitrarily discriminate between plaintiffs and others of the same class.  Plaiantiffs seek a permanent injunction restraining City from enforcing the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 13 March 1967, Judge Froneberger issued a temporary restraining order, which was continued until the final hearing before Judge Hasty on 31 May 1967.  The parties waived a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  jury trial and stipulated that Judge Hasty might hear the evidence, make findings of fact, and render final judgment on the merits of the cause.  Both plaintiffs and defendant offered evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs' evidence tended to show the following facts: Plaintiff Violet M. McDaniel is manager and masseuse at the BMG Health Company.  On 12 December 1966, she worked in a similar capacity at Marie's Health Salon.  All of the customers of Marie's in early December 1966 were men and all the employees were women (masseuses).  Immediately prior to the enactment of the ordinance, Marie's employed four trained masseuses, whose weekly income was $ 70.00-$ 80.00.  The average weekly income of the Health Salon varied from $ 500.00-$ 700.00.  After the passage of the ordinance, Marie's closed until the latter part of February 1967, when a male massager (masseur) was obtained.  The income of Marie's during a threeweeks' period with the male operator was only $ 60.00.  After the temporary restraining order was obtained, the income of the salon returned to its pre-ordinance level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's evidence tended to show: At the time the ordinance was passed, approximately 17 massage parlors, or health&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  salons, were operating in the City of Charlotte.  The city council enacted the ordinance at the request of the police department, which had received numerous complaints that certain lewd and unlawful conduct was routine in these establishments.  Several plain-clothes police officers of the City, in the course of an official investigation, had visited the massage parlors, requested and received lewd massages.  Their inquiries revealed that some of the massage parlors were likewise places of prostitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Hasty found facts in accordance with all the evidence and concluded that (1) immoral acts are likely to result, and do result, from the massage of a person of one sex by a person of another sex in massage parlors and health salons; (2) that the challenged ordinance seeks to protect the health and morals of the Charlotte community; and (3) that the ordinance does not prohibit, but merely regulates, the conduct of massage parlors and health salons.  He ruled that the ordinance was a constitutional exercise of City's police powers and dissolved the restraining order, which had been issued on March 13th.  Plaintiffs excepted to the judgment and appealed.  </SPAN></P>

The masseuses' first attack on the ordinance asserted that it unreasonably obstructed their right to earn a livelihood by giving massage treatments, which was an ordinary and harmless occupation that the municipality had no authority to regulate. The second contention was that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it discriminated among persons and establishments of the same kind. The court reversed the judgment that upheld the ordinance because the ordinance unconstitutionally prohibited the proprietors and employees of massage parlors from doing acts that could have been performed with impunity under similar circumstances in a barber shop or any of the other exempted places of business.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">McKinnon, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 2 October 1967 Special Civil Session of Wake docketed in the Supreme Court as Case No. 550 and argued at the Fall Term 1967.  Before argument in the Court of Appeals, upon motion of all parties, this appeal was certified for transfer to this Court pursuant to G.S. 7A-31(b).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff, a taxpayer, instituted this action to enjoin defendants, the Director of the Department of Administration for the State of North Carolina, the State Budget Officer, the State Disbursing Officer, and the North Carolina Industrial Development Financing Authority (Authority) from expending any money from the State's Contingency and Emergency Fund, or other tax funds, for or on behalf of Authority.  Authority was created by Chapter 535 of the Session Laws of 1967, the &quot;North Carolina Industrial Development Financing Act&quot; (Act), now codified as Chapter 123A of the North Carolina General Statutes.  This appeal involves the constitutionality of the Act.  All material facts are stipulated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislative findings, which preface the enactment, are: The creation of Authority as &quot;a public agency and an instrumentality of the State&quot; is necessary &quot;to meet the challenge&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of attracting new industry posed by the inducements to industry offered through legislative enactments in other jurisdictions.&quot; Its purposes, specifically declared to be &quot;public,&quot; are to promote industry and the natural resources of the State, increase gainful employment and purchasing power, improve living conditions, advance the general economy, expand facilities for research and development, increase vocational training opportunities, and otherwise contribute to the prosperity and welfare of the State &quot;by providing facilities for operation by private operators useful for industrial and research pursuits.  . . .&quot; G.S. 123A-2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The material portions of the Act, except when quoted, are summarized below:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The projects which Authority may undertake are the rehabilitation, enlargement, construction, operation, maintenance, and equipment of any building or structure (with necessary appurtenances thereto) for use as a factory, mill, processing, fabricating, or assembly plant, distribution center, or facility for industrial, medical, electronic or other types of research and development.  &quot;[N]o retail or wholesale store and no office, storage or other commercial facility not incidental&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the foregoing uses, however, shall be included in any project.  G.S. 123A-3(7).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authority is composed of seven members: the State Treasurer, the Chairman of the Department of Conservation and Development, and five gubernatorial appointees, who shall have the qualifications specified in G.S. 123A-4(a).  Authority is empowered to appoint an executive director, a secretary, and such other officers as it deems advisable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to all the usual powers incidental and necessary to routine corporate existence, G.S. 123A-5(1)-(13) gives Authority the following powers (enumeration ours):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(a) To issue industrial revenue bonds (and revenue refunding bonds) to provide funds to pay the cost of acquiring sites and the construction and equipment of projects thereon; (b) to make all contracts necessarily incident to such acquisition, construction and financing; and (c) to lease, sell, or otherwise dispose of any real or personal property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;criteria and requirements&quot; which shall govern Authority in undertaking a project are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) The project &quot;shall make a significant contribution to the economic growth&quot; of the governmental unit &quot;in which it shall be located&quot;; (2) it shall not involve&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the relocation of an existing industrial or research facility to some other part of the State &quot;unless the Authority determines that there is a clear and justifiable reason therefor&quot;; (3) the proposed lessee of any project shall be financially responsible, willing and able to operate, repair and maintain the leased project at its own expense; and (4) the local governmental unit in which the project is to be located must &quot;be able to cope satisfactorily with the impact of such project&quot; by providing the services and facilities necessary to its construction, operation, and maintenance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authority's determination whether the foregoing &quot;criteria and requirements&quot; have been met is final.  G.S. 123A-6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governmental body of the local unit must approve a project and request Authority to finance and construct it before Authority may do so.  G.S. 123A-7(b).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authority's bonds shall be designated &quot;North Carolina Industrial Development Financing Authority Revenue Bonds . . . .  Series,&quot; each series being designated by the name of the local unit in which the project is to be located.  The bonds shall mature as Authority designates (but not later than 40 years) and may be redeemable under conditions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fixed by it prior to the issuance of the bonds.  The proceeds of each issue shall be used only to pay the cost of the project for which such bonds are issued.  G.S. 123A-14(b).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authority's bonds, by the express provisions of G.S. 123A-13, &quot;shall not be deemed to constitute a debt, liability or obligation of the State or of any political subdivision thereof or a pledge of the faith and credit of the State or of any such political subdivisions,&quot; but principal and interest &quot;shall be payable solely from the revenues and other funds provided therefor.&quot; Each bond issued shall contain a statement to this effect on the face thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notwithstanding any recitals in Authority's bonds, they are made negotiable instruments under the laws of this State, subject only to the provisions for registration in any resolution authorizing them and to any trust agreement securing them.  G.S. 123A-19.  The bonds are made legal and proper investments for public officers or agencies, insurance companies, trust companies, banking associations, investment companies, and all fiduciaries.  They are also made securities which may be deposited with any state or municipal agency &quot;for any purpose for which the deposit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of bonds or obligations of the State is now or may hereafter be authorized by law.&quot; G.S. 123A-20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authority shall not mortgage any part of any project, but it may secure its bonds by a trust agreement whereby &quot;the fees, rents, charges, proceeds from the sale of any project, . . . insurance proceeds, condemnation awards and other funds and revenues to be received therefor&quot; are pledged to a corporate trustee.  G.S. 123A-15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Construction contracts may be awarded in the manner Authority decides will best promote free and open competition.  It may, however, award contracts &quot;upon a negotiated basis.&quot; G.S. 123A-10.  No member of Authority shall be interested in any contract with it unless Authority determines his interest to be &quot;so minor as not to be within the purview&quot; of G.S. 123A-11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a project is constructed, Authority shall lease it to one or more persons, firms, or private corporations for operation and maintenance.  Neither Authority nor any other governmental agency may operate any project financed under the Act except temporarily in order to protect its interest in the project pending its leasing.  G.S. 123A-8.  Authority's lease agreements may provide, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (a) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lessee shall operate and maintain the facility at its own expense; pay a rental sufficient to pay principal, interest, and redemption premiums, if any, on the bonds issued by Authority to finance the leased premises, plus any costs of construction or financing not paid out of the proceeds of the bonds or otherwise; (b) the lease shall not terminate before all bonds and other obligations incurred by Authority in connection with the leased project shall be fully paid, or adequate funds for such payment shall be deposited in trust; and (c) lessee may extend or renew the lease or purchase the project upon conditions consistent with the Act and in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 123A-8(5).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lessee of any project is required to list it for taxation in the manner of an owner and to pay &quot;an amount equal to the total amount of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ad valorem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> taxes that would . . . be levied&quot; upon the leased property if it were owned by a private citizen.  G.S. 123A-9.  Authority, however, shall not be required to pay any taxes on any property which it owns under the provisions of the Act or upon any income derived therefrom.  Its revenue bonds, their transfer, and the income derived therefrom (including&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  any profit made from a sale thereof) shall also be free from taxation by the State or any of its political subdivisions.  The bonds are, however, subject to inheritance and gift taxes, and the leasehold interest of the lessee in a project is not exempt from taxation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When all bonds and all costs incurred by Authority for any project have been paid (or sufficient money deposited in trust for their payment), Authority shall convey its interest in the project by quitclaim deed to the local unit in which the project is located if its governing body consents to the conveyance.  This conveyance will be subject to any agreement, lease, option, covenants, limitations, liens, and other encumbrances affecting the project.  &quot;Any property so conveyed may be administered and used by the local unit for the purposes of this chapter or any other lawful purpose.&quot; G.S. 123A-22.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to enable Authority to organize and commence its operations, G.S. 123A-12 authorizes the Governor and the Council of State to transfer to it out of the Contingency and Emergency Fund such amounts, not otherwise obligated, as they shall deem necessary to enable Authority to organize and operate during the first two&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  years of its existence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the same day the General Assembly passed the Act (19 May 1967), it also adopted Resolution No. 52.  This resolution recited that North Carolina -- reluctantly, with reservations, and as a defensive measure -- had joined thirty-five states in authorizing the issuance of industrial revenue bonds.  It urged the President and the other forty-nine states to request the Congress of the United States &quot;to make the interest received by the owners of so-called industrial revenue bonds hereafter issued subject to all applicable federal income tax laws.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five members of Authority appointed by the Governor are defendants Wilbur Clark, Frank H. Kenan, T. Huber Hanes, Jr., J. Carlton Fleming, and David L. Ward, Jr.  On 16 August 1967, Authority was duly constituted and organized.  It now has a chairman, a secretary, and an acting executive director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to Authority's request, and purporting to act under the authority of G.S. 123A-12, the Governor and Council of State approved an allotment in the sum of $ 37,062.00 from the State's Contingency and Emergency Fund for the use of Authority for the fiscal year 1967-68.  The Contingency and Emergency Fund represents&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  money collected from citizens, residents, associations, and corporations of the State through various forms of taxation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 6 September 1967, plaintiff instituted this action to restrain the payment of any money from the Contingency and Emergency Fund to Authority and to enjoin Authority from accepting and spending any such funds.  Plaintiff alleges that the Act is unconstitutional in that (1) it authorizes the use of public funds for other than a public purpose in violation of N. C. Constitution article 5, &sect; 3 and article 1, &sect; 17 and the 14th Amendment, &sect; 1 of the United States Constitution; (2) it authorizes lending the credit of the State to private entities without a vote of the people in violation of N. C. Constitution article 5, &sect; 4 and article VII, &sect; 6; (3) it delegates legislative authority contrary to the provisions of N. C. Constitution article 1, &sect; 8; (4) it authorizes the creation of a debt in contravention of N. C. Constitution article 7, &sect; 6 or article 5, &sect; 4; and (5) it exempts property from taxation in violation of N. C. Constitution article 5, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answering the complaint, defendants admitted each allegation of fact and controverted each conclusion of law&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  set out therein.  Defendants prayed the court to declare the Act constitutional in every respect and to deny plaintiff the equitable relief he seeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the case was called for trial, Judge McKinnon heard the cause upon the parties' stipulation of facts.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, this stipulation contained the facts detailed above.  It also contained a list of thirty-nine states &quot;allowing industrial development&quot; bonds; estimates of the total amount of such bonds issued each year since 1951; statements with reference to the bonded indebtedness of the State of North Carolina and its tax revenues; statements compiled by the U. S. Chamber of Commerce purporting to show the effect upon an area of every one hundred new factory workers; and statements which suggest that &quot;several large industrial firms&quot; permitted options upon industrial sites in North Carolina to expire because this State did not &quot;afford financing of industrial sites through tax-exempt industrial revenue bonds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge McKinnon found the facts to be in accordance with the stipulations.  He adjudged that the Act promoted a public purpose; that it violated no provision of the State or Federal Constitution; and that it was in every&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  respect a valid enactment.  From the judgment denying plaintiff any relief and dismissing the action, plaintiff appealed.  </SPAN></P>

Pursuant to the Act, the governor approved the transfer of funds from the state's contingency and emergency fund to the state agency. The contingency and emergency fund represented money collected from citizens through taxation. The taxpayer initiated an action against the state to restrain the payment of the funds on the grounds that it authorized the use of public funds for other than a public purpose in violation of the state constitution. The trial court dismissed the taxpayer's action finding the Act constitutional. On appeal, the court found that the Act violated the state constitution. The state agency's primary purpose was to acquire sites and equip facilities for private industries. The court found that such purpose was not for public use or a public purpose. Public money could not be used for the primary purpose of acquiring either by eminent domain or by purchase private lands to be turned over or sold to private persons for private use.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Edward W. Dawson, together with Robert H. Coleman, Hugh Vaughn, Jr., and James G. Buck, was tried upon five counts contained in four bills of indictment, which are summarized below:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill No. 47 charges that defendant and the three other persons named above, on 24 November 1966, did unlawfully assault Ernest Farrington with a deadly weapon, a pistol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill No. 48 charges (1) that defendant and the aforesaid three other persons, without intent to commit a felony, on 24 November 1966, did break and enter the dwelling of Lawrence Williamson, in which his personal property was kept, and (2) that on the same day they did unlawfully, wilfully, and maliciously damage and deface the dwelling house of Lawrence Williamson by painting the letters KKK thereon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill No. 49 charges that defendant and the three other persons heretofore named, on 24 November 1966, did unlawfully, wilfully and maliciously injure the dwelling house of Sarah Foust by firing bullets into the windows and walls and by painting on it the letters KKK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill No. 50 charges that defendant and the aforesaid three persons, on 24 November&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1966, &quot;did unlawfully &amp; wilfully arm themselves with unusual and dangerous weapons, to wit: Pistols and Rifles and, for the wicked and mischievous purpose of terrifying and alarming the citizens of Alamance County, did ride or go about the public highways of Alamance County without lawful excuse armed with said weapons in a manner as would cause a terror and annoyance and danger to the citizens of said County. . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, defendant Dawson, through his present counsel, moved to quash each of the bills of indictment.  The motions were overruled, and defendant entered a plea of not guilty to each charge.  The cases were consolidated for trial.  At the conclusion of the State's evidence, defendant also rested and moved for a judgment of nonsuit.  The motion was denied.  In case No. 47, the jury was unable to reach a verdict, and a mistrial was declared.  In each of the other cases, the verdict was &quot;guilty as charged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following prison sentences were imposed: In case No. 48, both counts consolidated for judgment, 12 months, prison sentence suspended for 5 years upon the usual conditions; case No. 49, 18 months; case No. 50, 18 months to run concurrently with the sentence imposed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in case No. 49.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the judgments entered, defendant Dawson appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant challenged his convictions by the trial court (North Carolina), for breaking and entering, damaging and defacing a dwelling, injuring a dwelling, and going armed with unusual and dangerous weapons to the terror of the people.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Subsequent to his convictions, the court reversed judgment as to the breaking and entering, and damaging and defacing a dwelling convictions but found no error in the remaining convictions. The court found that the counts in the indictment sufficiently charged the misdemeanor of nonfelonious breaking and entering the dwelling house as well as that defendant unlawfully and willfully defaced a home. The court determined, however, that the evidence was not sufficient to establish the violations alleged, primarily because the evidence did not disclose when the acts were committed or by whom. The court found that the indictments for injuring a dwelling and for going armed with unusual and dangerous weapons to the terror of the people were sufficient to support the convictions because they both alleged all of the constituent elements of the crimes involved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The convictions for breaking and entering, and damaging and defacing a dwelling were reversed, but the convictions for injuring a dwelling and going armed with unusual and dangerous weapons to the terror of the people were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon an indictment, proper in form, the defendant was tried for the murder of Chester Leggett and was found guilty of murder in the second degree.  He was sentenced to imprisonment in the State Prison for 20 to 30 years.  The only assignments of error relate to the denial of his motion for a directed verdict of not guilty and to the admission of evidence over his objection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence introduced by the State, without objection, is to the following effect:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, 4 September 1966, the defendant and Leggett had an altercation which began in a parked automobile in which they, two women and another man were sitting in front of the home of a mutual friend.  Leggett and his woman companion, whom the defendant had also dated on occasion, got out of the car, the defendant remaining therein.  Leggett called back to the defendant and told the defendant that if he had anything to &quot;settle&quot; to come on down the road and settle it with him.  Thereupon, the defendant got out of the car with a knife in his hand and went down the road toward Leggett.  They began to tussle.  Leggett grabbed the defendant's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  wrist and they fell to the ground.  He could not take the knife from the defendant and got up and told the defendant to &quot;go on,&quot; and that &quot;he didn't want to mess with him.&quot; Leggett started down the road and the defendant ran up behind him.  Leggett picked up a stone and they began to tussle again.  The defendant still had the knife.  Leggett dropped the stone.  They resumed the struggle and again fell to the ground.  When they got up, Leggett was backing away down the road and the defendant was walking toward him with the knife.  Leggett then picked up a piece of plank about three feet long and two inches wide.  Swinging this in front of him, he continued to back away from the defendant until he (Leggett) backed into a wire fence.  Leggett did not hit the defendant with the piece of plank.  Witnesses saw the defendant go up to Leggett and saw his right arm go up and down three times.  Leggett fell against the fence and then began to run down the road.  Leggett and the defendant were 38 and 65 years of age, respectively, Leggett being substantially taller and heavier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foregoing fight occurred at approximately 3 p.m. About 4:15 p.m., in response to a call, Assistant Police Chief&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Heye went to the scene and found Leggett lying on the ground about one block from where the fight occurred.  Leggett's shirt was full of blood and he appeared to be in agony.  The officer observed three stab wounds or cuts, one in the middle of the chest.  After a brief conversation with Leggett, the officer carried him to the hospital where, upon arrival, he was pronounced dead by the examining physician.  At the trial it was stipulated that the cause of Leggett's death was a stab wound in the center of his chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over objection, Officer Heye was permitted to testify that when he found Leggett he asked him three times who had cut him and, on the third time, Leggett replied, &quot;Mr. Dennis&quot; (the defendant).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through a series of questions, interspersed with objections and motions to strike, all of which were overruled, the State introduced the testimony of Officer Heye to the following effect:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Leggett had been pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital, Officer Heye, by radio, instructed Officer Fipps to pick up the defendant and take him to the police station in Chadbourn, which Officer Fipps did.  Upon arrival at the police station from the hospital, Officer Heye found the defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  there and transported him to the jail in Whiteville, where the coroner was waiting, the coroner having gone to the hospital before Officer Heye left it.  During the ride from the police station in Chadbourn to the jail in Whiteville, Officer Heye did not interrogate the defendant, but the defendant &quot;persisted&quot; in telling Officer Heye what had happened, so the officer &quot;just let him go ahead and talk.&quot; The defendant told Officer Heye that he had cut Leggett with a knife and meant to do it, intending to put a stop to Leggett's &quot;picking and staying in behind him all the time.&quot; Upon arrival at the jail in Whiteville, Officer Heye asked the defendant where he had left his knife.  The defendant replied that he had left it on a table between the sink and the refrigerator in the house of Joe Collins, in front of which house the fight began.  Officer Heye then instructed Officer Fipps to go to the Collins residence and get the knife, which Officer Fipps did, finding it on the table in the location so described by the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Fipps, over objection, testified that he found a knife, as described to him by Officer Heye in the latter's instructions, in the place so specified.  Over objection, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the knife was introduced in evidence.  It was a small paring knife with a wooden handle, approximately six inches long.  It was then in the same condition as when offered in evidence.  Officer Fipps also testified that earlier, pursuant to his original instructions by radio from Officer Heye, he had gone to the scene of the fight and found the defendant in the road.  He and two other officers, who were with him, asked the defendant to ride with them down to the police station, telling him they wanted to talk with him.  He got in the police car and accompanied these officers to the police station in Chadbourn, where he was when Officer Heye arrived from the hospital.  There was no evidence of any statement by the defendant to these officers or by them to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no evidence that Officer Heye, or any other officer, at any time advised the defendant of his constitutional rights to remain silent and to have an attorney or of any other constitutional right.  No examination of any officer was conducted in the absence of the jury with reference to the voluntary or involuntary nature of statements by the defendant.  The court made no findings of fact with reference thereto, merely&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  overruling, without comment, objections by the defendant to questions propounded to the officers with reference to the above statements and to the finding of the knife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the above testimony by the police officers, counsel for the defendant cross examined each of the officers.  Upon cross examination, Officer Heye testified that he had &quot;a very brief conversation&quot; with the defendant at the Chadbourn police station and that the defendant began to tell him what had happened.  Thereupon, Officer Heye told the defendant that they had to go over to Whiteville and the coroner was waiting for them at the jail.  On the way to the jail the defendant &quot;volunteered to tell him what happened.&quot; The defendant was nervous and wanted to talk about what had taken place and Officer Heye &quot;let him go ahead and talk.&quot; During the course of that conversation, the defendant told Officer Heye that he and Leggett had had a fight, and also told him that he (the defendant) had &quot;stabbed him&quot; (Leggett).  During this conversation on the way to Whiteville, the defendant told Officer Heye where he could find the knife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On cross examination, Officer Fipps testified that, pursuant to instructions from Officer&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Heye, he went to the scene of the fight, which was in front of the Joe Collins residence and, finding the defendant there, requested him to go to the police station because the officers &quot;wanted to talk to him.&quot; He did not place the defendant under arrest at any time or inform him why the officers wanted to talk to him.  He had no other conversation with the defendant whatever.  The defendant did not object to being taken to the jail in Whiteville by Officer Heye.  He made no inquiry as to why he was being taken to Whiteville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant testified in his own behalf.  The substance of his testimony on direct examination was:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leggett, who was much younger and much larger than the defendant, without provocation, jumped on the defendant as they were walking together down the road from where they had gotten out of the automobile, began choking and beating the defendant and &quot;had him down.&quot; Thereupon, the defendant, being scared that Leggett would kill him, as he said he was going to do, stabbed Leggett.  Leggett then got up and the defendant put his knife back in his pocket.  Thereupon, Leggett got a rock and tried to hit the defendant with it.  The defendant backed off.  Leggett dropped&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the rock and picked up the piece of plank.  The defendant then pulled his knife out of his pocket again to keep Leggett from hurting him.  Leggett was trying to hit him with the piece of plank.  After Leggett dropped the plank and ran, the defendant saw Leggett no more.  He went to the police station with Officer Fipps.  Upon being asked when he found out that he was under arrest, the defendant replied that he &quot;never found out.&quot; He went to the Whiteville jail with Officer Heye.  On the way Officer Heye asked him where the knife was and the defendant told him where to find it on the table in Joe Collins' house.  He had previously been arrested and convicted for public drunkenness five or six times, and in 1963 he had been given a suspended sentence for &quot;assault with a deadly weapon.&quot; He did not have his knife in his hand when he got out of the automobile and walked down the road toward Leggett before the start of the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On cross examination the defendant testified:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and Leggett were not quarreling over Leggett's woman companion.  They had had no quarrel at all prior to Leggett's &quot;jumping on him&quot; as they walked together down the road.  While Leggett had the defendant down on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the ground, with one hand on his neck and hitting him with the other, the defendant reached in his pocket, got the knife and stabbed Leggett.  He then put his knife back in his pocket and did not take it out again until Leggett picked up the piece of plank and started swinging it.  Then Leggett backed up against the fence, dropped the piece of plank and ran.  He does not know where he stabbed Leggett or how many times.  He did not stab Leggett while the latter was backed up against the fence, but while Leggett had him down on the ground.  On the way to Whiteville he told Officer Heye that he had stabbed Leggett and where the officer could find the knife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on cross examination the defendant identified the knife in evidence as the one he &quot;stabbed Chester Leggett with,&quot; and, over objection, in response to a question by the solicitor, he testified that his former suspended sentence for &quot;assault with a deadly weapon&quot; was for his use of &quot;a pocket knife.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">A Columbus County trial court (North Carolina) convicted defendant of murder in the second degree. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The State presented evidence that defendant ran after the victim and stabbed him. Defendant claimed he acted in self defense. He also claimed that the trial court erred in admitting evidence over his objection and denying his motion for a directed verdict of not guilty. There was no error in denying defendant's motion for a directed verdict of not guilty. Defendant's testimony that he stabbed the victim in self defense presented a question for the jury which simply did not accept his version. The court found that it was error to admit the officer's testimony that the victim identified defendant as the person who stabbed him. The statement was hearsay and did not qualify as a dying declaration because there was insufficient evidence to show that the victim fully understood the danger of his imminent and inevitable death. It was also error under the Miranda rule to introduce defendant's admissions made to the officer that he stabbed the victim. However, when defendant elected to testify in his own behalf, and testified that he intentionally stabbed the victim, his testimony cured the errors by rendering them harmless. The court found that no error merited a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendants from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Fountain, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 6 February 1967 Session of Bertie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants were tried on separate warrants, which were consolidated for trial.  The warrants, as to all of the defendants except Frinks, charged that on or about 13 September 1966 the defendant named therein &quot;did knowingly, wilfully and unlawfully interrupt and disturb the Southwestern High School, a public school in Bertie County, N. C., by picketing in front of the Southwestern High School,&quot; which picketing interfered with classes at the school in violation of G.S. 14-273.  The warrant against Frinks charged him with aiding and abetting in such interruption and disturbance of the school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to pleading to the warrants, the defendants moved to quash each warrant on the ground that it shows upon its face that the defendant named therein was &quot;in the peaceful and orderly exercise of First Amendment rights of picketing and * * * of freedom of speech and protest,&quot; and on the further ground that G.S. 14-273 is unconstitutional, as applied to the alleged conduct of the defendants, &quot;by reason of the obvious collision between the statute and the rights of peacefully picketing.&quot; The motion to quash&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was overruled as to each defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to pleading to the warrants, the defendants challenged the array of jurors summoned for that session of the superior court, the ground of the challenge being that Negroes had been systematically excluded from the jury list, and so from the jury box, from which the panel in question was drawn.  All of the defendants are Negroes.  The court conducted a hearing upon this motion, at which numerous witnesses, including county officials and others, were called by the defendants and examined.  The presiding judge thereupon found as a fact that &quot;there has been a disproportionate number of white persons to that of Negro persons whose names have been put in the jury box for the drawing of jurors&quot; as compared with the proportion of Negro residents of the county to the total population, and as compared with the proportion of Negroes listing property for taxes with the total number of persons so doing, which disproportion he found to have been without any intention to discriminate on account of race in the selection of names to be placed in the jury box.  The trial judge then ordered that &quot;to assure each defendant that he and she will be tried by jurors&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  who are selected without regard to race,&quot; no juror will be called into the box for the trial of these cases from the regular panel, but the sheriff would summon &quot;fifty persons who are qualified to serve as jurors * * * without regard to race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sheriff so summoned a special venire and from it the trial jury was selected, six of its members being Negroes and six being white persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereupon, prior to entering their pleas to the warrants, the defendants objected to the special venire on the ground that they were entitled to be tried by jurors &quot;selected by the Constitutional system that is provided by the State.&quot; The sheriff was called as a witness and examined by the defendants concerning the method used by him in selecting those comprising the special venire.  The objection of the defendants to the special venire was overruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereupon, the defendants entered pleas of not guilty.  The jury returned a verdict of guilty as to each defendant.  The defendants, other than Frinks, were fined in varying amounts.  Frinks was sentenced to confinement in the county jail for a term of 60 days.  Each defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State called as witnesses the principal of Southwestern High&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  School, the teacher of the class in bricklaying at the school, and the sheriff of the county.  The defendants offered no evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The school principal testified that on the date named in the several warrants the school was in session.  It is located on Highway 308, some five miles from the Town of Windsor.  Only two residences are in the vicinity of the school, the nearest being 100 yards away.  The school building sits back from the highway approximately 500 feet.  At the time of the alleged offense, the class in brick masonry was in progress, under the direction of its teacher, on the school grounds approximately 10 to 25 feet from the highway, the students in the class being engaged in the erection of certain brick structures as part of their class work.  Other pupils were inside the building where classes were in progress.  Frinks drove up to a point on the highway in front of the school, &quot;unloaded some children and took out some signs with various wording * * * and gave each one a sign and they began to picket&quot;; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">i.e.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, to walk up and down the ditch separating the highway from the school campus.  The school principal thereupon asked the sheriff, who was present, &quot;if he could&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  get those people away.&quot; Each of the defendants, other than Frinks, participated in the marching.  (The principal did not name Lewis Cherry among the marchers, but he was so named by the sheriff.) This conduct by the defendants resulted in the pupils within the school building &quot;looking and carrying on&quot; to such an extent that the principal had &quot;to get them back to their classes and walk up and down the hall * * * trying to keep them in class.&quot; When the principal went back into the building, he found pupils in the classes in progress in rooms facing the highway &quot;looking out of the windows at what was going on,&quot; and pupils from classes in progress on the other side of the building corridor &quot;running to the side that looked out on the marchers to see what was happening.&quot; These students &quot;were talking among themselves * * * saying what they had seen.&quot; The brick masonry class, consisting of 15 or 16 students, was taken from its work on the school grounds back to the &quot;shop&quot; before the completion of its fully allotted class period.  There was no problem in keeping order in the school except during the time &quot;when these defendants were out in front&quot; of the school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teacher of the class in bricklaying&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  testified that he was conducting his class on the school grounds, the project in hand being the construction of some brick columns, some ten feet from the ditch in or along which the defendants, other than Frinks, marched.  There were 15 students in the class.  The marchers appeared some ten minutes after the class started.  They arrived in an automobile, got out of it in front of the school grounds, passed out some signs and then marched along the ditch.  The teacher tried to keep his students busy but the marchers took their attention, and some of the students stopped what they were doing and watched the marchers.  The teacher talked to his students but could not maintain control of the class, so he gathered up the tools and took the class back into the building two hours before they were scheduled to complete their assignment on the grounds.  The marchers were not singing, clapping their hands, or doing anything except marching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sheriff testified that he had been at the school when it opened for the day's work, but after the school opened, he left in his automobile.  Approximately four miles away he met Frinks with four or five other people in his car.  The sheriff at once&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  returned to the school.  Upon his arrival there, he found Frinks' car parked on the shoulder of the highway, with several people standing around it, and Frinks handing out signs &quot;to the students.&quot; (Apparently the marchers were students enrolled in the school but not in attendance upon classes that day.) The sheriff asked Frinks if he was aware of the statute of North Carolina forbidding the interruption of a public school.  Frinks replied, &quot;I don't care anything about what is in the Statute Books.&quot; (The court instructed the jury that the testimony of the sheriff concerning the remarks of Frinks was evidence as to Frinks only and not as to any other defendant.) The defendants, other than Frinks, together with some eight others who were &quot;juveniles,&quot; then lined up and started marching.  They were arrested after they had marched up and down two or three times.  The sheriff observed several students standing and watching the demonstration and the marching.  He also observed the teacher of the bricklaying class carry his class back into the &quot;shop.&quot; After passing out the signs to the marchers and lining up the marchers, &quot;Frinks got in his car and drove off, headed toward Windsor.&quot; Approximately&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  20 minutes elapsed from the arrival of the defendants at the site of the marching to the arrest of the marchers.  Frinks was arrested two days later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The various signs carried by the marchers read as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;God set us free why should we be here as slaves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A change is going to come.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendants contended that &sect; 14-273 was void because its prohibitions were uncertain, vague or indefinite. Defendants further argued that the statute contained no definition of &quot;interrupt&quot; or of &quot;disturb&quot;, and consequently, men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and thus were left in doubt as to what conduct was prohibited. In affirming, the court held giving the words of &sect; 14-273 their plain and ordinary meaning, it was apparent what that the elements of the offense punishable under the statute were. The court held that the 12 defendants intentionally paraded back and forth in front of the specified public school building and grounds in the immediate vicinity of a class then in progress on the school grounds and the one defendant aided, abetted, directed and counseled the marching. The court found that the testimony by the students who were actually disturbed and interrupted by defendants was proper. The court held that the trial court did not err when it ordered a special jury venire, which was expressly authorized by N.C. Gen.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separate warrants were issued by the Municipal-County Court of Guilford County, Criminal Division, for the arrest of George F. Dorsett, Larry Franklin Dorsett and Tommy Yow.  Each charges the defendant named therein, on June 8, 1967, &quot;did unlawfully and wilfully disturb the peace by the use of a motorcycle in such a manner as to create loud and unnecessary noise, in the 1700 and 1800 blocks of Trogdon Street, Greensboro, North Carolina, in violation of Greensboro Code of Ordinances, Section 13-12(b)(4),&quot; etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In each case, the said Municipal-County Court adjudged the defendant guilty and pronounced judgment and defendant appealed.  When the cases were called in the superior court, each defendant moved to quash the warrant &quot;on the grounds (1) that the City Ordinance under which the defendants were being prosecuted was unconstitutional for vagueness and (2) that the warrants in question failed to allege a violation of the City Ordinance.&quot; The court allowed each defendant's motion to quash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreed statement of case on appeal contains the following: &quot;After hearing the arguments&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of counsel for the defendants and arguments of the Solicitor for the State, the Court, although declining to rule that the ordinance in question was or was not unconstitutional for vagueness, allowed the motions to quash on the ground that each warrant failed to allege a violation of the ordinance in question.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State of North Carolina in apt time excepted to each of the court's rulings and gave notice of appeal.  The three cases, all involving the same legal question, are before us in one consolidated record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendants were charged with disturbing the peace by use of a motorcycle under Greensboro, N.C., Code of Ordinances &sect; 13-12. The State of North Carolina sought review of a decision from the Guilford County trial court (North Carolina), which found that the city ordinance under which defendants were being prosecuted was unconstitutional for vagueness and the warrants failed to allege a violation of the city ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court found that the warrants were in compliance with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160-172 and sufficiently pled the ordinance on which the prosecutions were based. The declared purpose of the ordinance was to prohibit any unreasonably loud, disturbing, and unnecessary noise within the city limits. Each warrant charged each defendant with creating a loud and unnecessary noise of such intensity as to constitute a wilful disturbance of the peace by the use of a motorcycle on June 8, 1967 at a certain block of the city. The court found that the warrants sufficiently charged the commission of a criminal offense created and defined by the ordinance. It was not necessary that the intensity of the noise had to be described in the warrant in terms of decibels as measured by an audiometer. Thus, the judgment quashing the warrants had to be reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court reversed the judgment that quashed the warrants charging defendants with disturbing the peace.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c1"><SPAN CLASS="c4">November 1, 1967, Filed </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> upon petitions of the defendants to review the judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Gambill, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 30 November 1964 Criminal Session of Guilford, Greensboro Division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In separate indictments these defendants and their co-defendant, Julian Odell Hairston, were charged with successive rapes of the same woman in Guilford County on 21 June 1964.  The cases were consolidated for trial over their objections.  As to each defendant, the jury returned a verdict of guilty, with a recommendation for life imprisonment.  Sentences were imposed accordingly.  Each defendant gave notice of appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, Yoes, represented by privately employed counsel, petitioned for permission to appeal as a pauper and for an order directing the county to furnish a transcript to him at its expense.  This petition was denied by the presiding judge.  This Court granted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, permitting Yoes to appeal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">in forma pauperis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and directing a full transcript to be supplied to him at the expense of the county.  Thereafter, this Court allowed other motions by Yoes for extensions of time for docketing the record in this Court for review.  The record so docketed in this Court consists of 1562 pages, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  being replete with needless and multiple repetitions of utterly immaterial matter, to a degree unparalleled in cases in which the appellant bears the expense of preparing the record for review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 4 March 1965, the presiding judge allowed the motion of the solicitor to dismiss the appeals of the defendants Davis, Hale and Hairston for failure to perfect the same within the time allowed.  A little more than one year thereafter, Davis and Hale filed separate petitions for post conviction relief, each alleging that his right of appeal had been denied.  These petitions were heard before Shaw, J., who so found, and on 15 July 1966 ordered their court appointed counsel to prepare and file their respective cases for review by this Court, directing that a complete transcript of the trial proceedings be furnished them at the expense of the county.  Petitions for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were thereupon filed in this Court on behalf of Davis and Hale.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was granted in each instance 20 September 1966, and the cases were set for argument in this Court for the Fall Term 1966.  Motions by the defendants for extension of time were subsequently granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acting upon the advice of his court appointed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  counsel, Hairston did not perfect his appeal, has not sought post conviction relief and has not otherwise sought appellate review of the judgment entered against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cases of Yoes, Davis and Hale were consolidated for argument in this Court and were argued 6 September 1967.  The three appealing defendants have joined in presenting to this Court the same record for review, the same assignments of error and a common brief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motions to Quash the Bills of Indictment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each defendant, in apt time, moved in the superior court to quash the bill of indictment against him on the grounds that (1) Negroes were systematically and arbitrarily excluded from service on the grand jury, each of the defendants being a Negro; (2) the statutory requirements were not observed in the selection of the grand jurors; (3) the statute providing for the death penalty upon conviction of rape is unconstitutional upon its face; and (4) the said statute is unconstitutional as applied in this State.  The motions to quash were overruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence relating to the selection of the grand jury may be summarized as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grand jury which indicted the defendants was selected from a panel of 50 names.  The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  panel was drawn from the jury box in the presence of the county commissioners by a child under ten years of age, on 1 June 1964, three weeks prior to the alleged offenses, six weeks prior to the returning of these indictments, and six months prior to the commencement of the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 50 names so drawn from the jury box were placed on a list which was then cut into scrolls, each scroll containing one name.  In open court, under the supervision of the presiding judge, these 50 scrolls were placed by the clerk in a hat, stirred and then drawn from the hat, one at a time, by a child seven years of age.  The first 18 names so drawn constituted the grand jury, two Negroes (11%, plus) being included and serving on the grand jury.  The foreman was then designated by the presiding judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury box, from which the panel was so drawn, consisted of two compartments, designated No. 1 and No. 2 and separated by a partition.  There was no opening in the box except a hinged top, which was locked shut by two substantial padlocks, opened by different keys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except when a jury is being drawn, the box is in the possession of the sheriff.  The key to one lock is kept by the clerk to the board of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  county commissioners in the office of the county manager.  The key to the other lock is kept in the custody of a deputy sheriff, who leaves it hanging on a keyboard in a portion of the sheriff's office to which other members of the sheriff's staff have access in the absence of this deputy.  There are no other keys which fit either lock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a jury panel is to be drawn, the box is brought by the sheriff into the presence of the board of county commissioners, then sitting in a meeting open to the public.  The names are drawn from Compartment No. 1 of the box in the presence of the commissioners by a child under ten years of age, the commissioners paying close attention.  The names so drawn are placed in an envelope which is sealed in the presence of the commissioners and delivered to the deputy sheriff.  The sheriff then summons those whose names are in the envelope.  The scrolls bearing such names are then returned to the jury box, being put into Compartment No. 2.  When the drawing of a jury panel is thus completed, the box is relocked and it and the two keys are returned to their respective custodians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the names of a jury panel are so drawn, no name is added to or taken from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the panel.  A person so summoned may apply to the clerk of the court or to the presiding judge to be excused from service because of a statutory exemption or personal hardship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This procedure was followed in the drawing and handling of the panel from which the grand jury in question was selected.  The child who drew these names from the jury box drew the scrolls, one by one, from Compartment No. 1 and handed each scroll to the deputy sheriff in the presence of the county commissioners and other persons attending the meeting of the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury list of names to go into the box is compiled anew each two years.  At the proper time, the names of approximately 70,000 persons, each written on a separate scroll, were placed in Compartment No. 1 of the jury box.  Except as noted below, all names so placed in the jury box were taken from the tax lists of the county for the year 1963.  The names of approximately 70,000 individuals appear on the tax lists.  Except as noted below, all of those names were placed in Compartment No. 1 of the jury box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no evidence as to how many of these 70,000 persons whose names appear on the tax lists for 1963 were white and how many were Negro, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  except that of the males listed for poll tax (all males between the ages of 21 and 50), 32,946 were white and 4,432 (11%, plus) were Negro. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c47"><SUP>*</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c48"><SPAN CLASS="c10">*&nbsp;For the year 1962, there is an obvious misprint in the record.  The North Carolina Department of Tax Research reports for that year that 32,829 white males and 4,321 Negro males (11%, plus) were listed for poll tax in Guilford County.  The United States Census for 1960 shows 194,984 white and 51,159 Negro residents (20%, plus) of all ages and both sexes in Guilford County, there being only a negligible number of residents of other races.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The county is divided into 18 townships for each of which a tax list is compiled.  From the annual tax listings, an IBM card for each person listing property or poll for taxation is prepared by the county's data processing office.  These cards are used for various purposes, including the preparation of tax bills, various statistical reports and studies, and the preparation of the list of names to go into the jury box.  Each card carries the name and certain code numbers applicable to such taxpayer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purpose of these code numbers is to enable the Data Processing Department of the county to prepare&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  quickly and accurately various statistical studies and reports.  For example, the county is required to report annually to the State Department of Tax Research the number of white males and Negro males, respectively, listed for poll tax purposes.  To facilitate the preparation of this report, and possibly other statistical reports, the code number &quot;1&quot; on a card designates a white person and the code number &quot;2&quot; designates a Negro person.  Other code numbers on these cards designate such things as the taxpayer's residence in a particular school or fire district, the last four digits of the taxpayer's social security number for identification purposes, the year of birth of males for poll tax purposes, whether the taxpayer is a nonresident or in military service, and the township in which property so listed is located.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of the drawing of the jury panel from which this grand jury was selected, the county commissioners were not aware of the significance of the code numbers &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;.  The scrolls which went into the jury box carried, in addition to the name and address of the person, these code numbers and other code numbers, but the commissioners did not know their significance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and were concerned only with the name and address of the person whose scroll was drawn by the child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the preparation of the jury list, the Data Processing Department, using the IBM machines, prepared a complete list of all names shown on the IBM cards for 1963.  The original and a carbon copy of this list were delivered to the Tax Department, the carbon copy being ultimately filed with the clerk of the board of county commissioners.  This list contained the name of every person listing property or poll for taxation in Guilford County in 1963.  The Tax Department eliminated duplications, as where the same taxpayer listed property in two or more townships.  It also deleted from this list the name of any wife listing property jointly with her husband and then prepared a separate slip for the wife, showing her name, address and appropriate code numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to instruction from the county commissioners, the Tax Department then turned to telephone directories and city directories and added to the list the names and addresses of a relatively few persons not appearing on the tax list, these names not carrying any code numbers, and the race of these persons being unknown to the Tax&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sheriff and his deputies then examined the list and eliminated therefrom persons who had died or moved out of the county or who had been convicted of a felony, or other crime involving moral turpitude, and persons not mentally competent to serve as jurors.  The county commissioners made no exclusions of names whatsoever from the list.  They delegated to the sheriff the task of so purging it, giving him no standards whatever for his guidance.  He and his deputies relied on their personal knowledge and judgment in striking off the names they deemed improper for inclusion for these reasons.  The sheriff knows of no instance of any person's being excluded from the list because of his race, creed or color.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list so compiled and revised was then cut into pieces or scrolls, each scroll bearing the name, address and the several code numbers of one person as shown on the IBM card in the Data Processing Department, no code numbers appearing on the scrolls of persons selected from city and telephone directories.  All of these scrolls were then placed in Compartment No. 1 of the jury box From this compartment of the box, the panel of 50 names, from which the grand jury was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  selected, was drawn as above described.  Except for the exclusions by the sheriff and his deputies, above mentioned, the name of every person listing property or poll for taxation in Guilford County in 1963 was so placed in Compartment No. 1 of the box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This process is repeated every two years, at the end of each such period the jury box being completely emptied of scrolls and refilled.  The members of the board of county commissioners did not see, and habitually do not see, the list, so compiled by the Tax Department and so purged by the sheriff and his staff, prior to its being cut apart and the scrolls being placed in the jury box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no evidence that the name of any person whose scroll was drawn from the jury box for the panel in question, or any other jury panel, was excluded from such panel by any person for any reason whatsoever.  Some, of course, were not found and so were not summoned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sheriff, the clerk of the court, the former solicitor, the tax supervisor, the chairman and other members of the board of county commissioners, all of whom had served for many years, each testified that he did not know of any instance in which the name of any person had been excluded&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from the jury list, or from any panel drawn, because of race, color or creed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon this evidence the trial court made findings of fact, including findings that Negroes were drawn and appeared on the grand jury that indicted these defendants; that the above mentioned code numbers indicating the race of the respective taxpayers remained on the scrolls placed in the jury box; when the panel from which the grand jury was selected was drawn from the box, the commissioners were not aware that the code numbers were on the scrolls and did not know their significance; no person's name was left out of the box, or added to the box, or laid aside upon the drawing of the panel because of race, creed or color; there has been no arbitrary or systematic exclusion from jury service in Guilford County at any time because of race, creed or color, and none with reference to the panels from which the grand jury and the trial jury in this case were chosen.  The court further found that the selection of the names going into the jury box and the drawing of names therefrom for jury service were in accord with Chapter 9 of the General Statutes of North Carolina.  Upon these findings of fact, the court denied&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the motions to quash the bills of indictment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Challenges to the Array.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In due time, the defendants filed challenges to the array, thus attacking the validity of the trial jury and of each panel or venire from which its members were chosen.  Of the 12 jurors returning the verdict, one was a member of the regular panel drawn for the term from the above described jury box in the above described manner.  The regular panel having been exhausted, the trial judge ordered three successive special venires, a total of 400 prospective jurors, and directed that their names be drawn from the jury box, which was done over the objection of each defendant entered in apt time.  From these drawings a total of nine jurors was selected.  The trial judge thereupon, over the objection of each defendant, issued another venire </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">facias</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> directing the sheriff to summon 50 additional persons, &quot;freeholders, qualified to act as jurors, from the body of&quot; the county.  From this group two of the 12 jurors were selected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the selection of the 50 persons, pursuant to the fourth venire </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">facias</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the sheriff used five pairs of deputies.  All were under the immediate direction of Lt. Allred, a member of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sheriff's staff, who had participated in the investigation of the alleged offense with which the defendants were charged, and who was then under subpoena as a witness for the State. Lt. Allred instructed the deputies to take a city directory, select at random a name out of every five or 10 pages, and then summon such persons by telephone.  He, himself, went to High Point, took the tax books of that area of the county, choose names from those books, and summoned by telephone the person so chosen by him.  He did not discuss the case with any of these persons.  He testified that no prospective juror was included or excluded because of race, though he could determine the race of each prospective juror so summoned by him by the address.  He did not know any of them personally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Frank Smith, who assisted Lt. Allred in the selection of these veniremen from the High Point area, and who was also under subpoena as a witness for the State, testified that they took 28 names at random from the tax books in High Point and telephoned these people until they reached and served their quota of 10.  He testified that they did not exclude or include any person for any reason whatever, but simply&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  took the names as they came to them by the above process.  He did not know any of the persons so selected and summoned by him, but did know the general areas of the city of High Point in which white people and Negro people, respectively, reside, and knew from the code numbers &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; appearing on the tax books which persons were white and which were Negro.  He had helped to select juries previously in Guilford County and knew of no case in which any person had been excluded from or included upon a jury because of race, creed or color.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 12 jurors having been selected from the regular panel, and the four special venires above mentioned, the court, over the objection of each defendant, issued a fifth venire </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">facias</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> directing the sheriff to summon 50 additional &quot;freeholders, qualified to act as jurors, from the body of&quot; the county.  The same procedure was used in selecting this venire as was followed in the fourth, except that, the tax office in High Point being closed, the names from the High Point area were selected for the fifth venire from the city directory.  From the fifth venire an alternate juror was selected but, before the jury retired to begin its deliberations, this&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  alternate juror was discharged and took no part in the deliberations or verdict of the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants' challenge to the array was upon the ground that the regular jury panel and the first three special venires were drawn from the jury box which, the defendants allege, afforded the opportunity for selective exclusion and discrimination against members of the Negro race.  As to the fourth special venire, which was not drawn from the box, the ground of challenge was that G.S. 9-29 and G.S. 9-30 are unconstitutional, and any special venire drawn pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 9-29 affords the opportunity for selective exclusion and discrimination against members of the Negro race and other citizens qualified to serve as jurors.  They further challenge the fourth special venire on the ground that the officers who selected the veniremen were witnesses for the State and had participated in the investigation of the alleged offenses, and, under all the circumstances, an opportunity was afforded for the selective exclusion and inclusion of persons upon such special venire in violation of the State and Federal Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both as to the regular panel and as to each special venire, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the names of all prospective jurors constituting such panel were written upon new scrolls and, in the presence of the court, placed in a box and drawn therefrom by a child under the age of 10 years, the members of each such panel being called for interrogation and rejection or selection as jurors in the order in which their respective names were so drawn from the box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presiding judge overruled the challenges to the array, reciting that the same findings of fact, made by him with reference to the grand jury in passing upon the motions to quash the bills of indictment, applied equally to the petit jurors chosen from the regular panel and from the first three special venires, all of which were drawn from the jury box.  As to the defendants' challenges to the fourth and fifth special venires, not drawn from the jury box, the court found as facts that Lt. Allred is the regular officer in charge of the service of such writs, that the names chosen from the tax lists in High Point by him were chosen at random, that he did not know any of the persons whose names were so chosen or any of the 50 persons who were summoned in response to each such venire </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">facias</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and that each such person&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was chosen in the usual and regular manner without regard to race, approximately 12 members of the Negro race being included in each such special venire of 50.  Accordingly, the challenges to the fourth and fifth special venires were overruled and denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other Pretrial Motions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In apt time, the defendants moved for separate trials.  Conversely, the solicitor moved to consolidate the four indictments for trial.  The solicitor's motion was allowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In apt time, the defendants moved that a jury be drawn from a county other than Guilford on the ground that the alleged offenses had received so much publicity and attention in Guilford County that a fair and impartial jury could not be obtained therein.  This motion was denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the purpose of introducing evidence in support of his contention that the statute of North Carolina providing for the death penalty upon conviction of rape was unconstitutional, in that it has been applied in North Carolina in a manner such as to discriminate against Negro males, the defendant Yoes caused to be issued certain subpoenas </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">duces tecum</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for the clerks of the superior courts of various counties other than Guilford, and for the Director of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  North Carolina State Prison System.  Upon motion of the solicitor, these subpoenas </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">duces tecum</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were quashed and the court refused to hear evidence as to the number of prosecutions for rape, the race of the defendants so prosecuted, and the number of white and Negro males sentenced to death for this offense in counties other than Guilford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Selection of the Trial Jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 250 prospective jurors were called into the box and examined in the process of selecting the 12 who were empaneled and who rendered the verdicts.  In the course of the examination of those prospective jurors, each defendant excepted to numerous denials of his challenges for alleged cause.  Each defendant exhausted the peremptory challenges allowed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants also entered numerous exceptions to questions propounded by the court to prospective jurors and explanations of the law by the court in the course of such interrogations with reference to the meaning of questions propounded by the solicitor or by counsel for a defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants interposed numerous other exceptions to the allowance by the court of a challenge for cause by the solicitor to each prospective juror who stated that he or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  she was conscientiously opposed to capital punishment, and therefore could not render a verdict which would result in the imposition of a death sentence, and to the court's permitting the solicitor to ask prospective jurors questions concerning such conscientious objection to the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assignments of Error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants assign as error each of the above rulings of the trial court, various portions of and alleged inadequacies in the charge and other rulings at the trial, which are set forth in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendants appealed, by writ of certiorari, the judgment of the Criminal Session of Guilford, Greensboro Division, (North Carolina) that, following a jury trial, convicted them of rape and imposed life sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendants, three black men found guilty of rape, appealed from their convictions. The court first found that the imposition of the death penalty upon conviction for rape was not unconstitutional per se and that the sentencing statute,&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-21, was not discriminatory facially or in its enforcement. The court further held that the county court properly denied defendants' motion to quash the grand jury indictment. Blacks were not arbitrarily and systematically excluded from the grand jury, and selecting grand jury members by drawing names from a list of county property or poll taxpayers, which included numbers indicating their race, was not racially discriminatory. With regard to the alleged violations of grand jury selection statutes, the court ruled that there was no evidence to indicate that any person of good moral character was stricken from the jury list and that the failure of court personnel to safeguard the jury box and keys, in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 9-2, did not invalidate the indictment. Nor did the court find that defendants' challenge to the array had merit. The court affirmed the judgments.</SPAN></P>

The court found no error in the judgment. The court stated that failure to supply counsel could not be said to be a deprivation of any constitutional right of defendant, because under the specific facts defendant's waiving of a preliminary hearing was not such a &quot;critical stage&quot; of the proceeding as to require the presence of counsel. The court stated that evidence of prior offenses of the same kind committed by defendant with the prosecuting witness was admissible in corroboration of the offenses charged or to prove identity. The court held that even conceding technical error in the testimony, considering all the facts of the case, and particularly the youthful age of the victim and other prosecution testimony, the admission of the challenged hearsay testimony was not so prejudicial as to warrant a new trial, and that it was likely a different result would not have been reached if the challenged evidence had been excluded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hobgood, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the November 1966 Civil Session of Alamance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a proceeding to condemn a right of way for a road to run approximately 770 feet across a tract of land owned by the defendants from a junction with North Carolina Highway No. 62 to the property line between the defendants and Associated Transport, Inc.  The purpose of the road is to provide access to the plant of Associated Transport, Inc., from Highway 62, which, in turn, connects nearby with Interstate Highway 85.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This proceeding was commenced 1 October 1965 by the issuance of a summons, the filing of a complaint, the filing of a declaration of taking, and the deposit with the Clerk of the estimated compensation due the defendants for the taking of their property.  On 6 October 1965, the plaintiff began construction of the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new road includes and runs upon a narrower roadway, previously opened and maintained by the defendants upon their own property.  This older roadway gave access to Highway 62 from two tenant houses, owned by the defendants and occupied by their tenants, near the line of what is now the property of Associated Transport, Inc.  The defendants contend that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this former roadway was a private road only.  The plaintiff contends that the defendants had offered to dedicate it to public use and that the act of the plaintiff in taking over its maintenance and improvement was an acceptance of such offer of dedication.  Throughout the period of construction and improvement of the new road by the plaintiff, it was at all times kept open for use and was used by the tenants of the defendants and by Associated Transport, Inc., its employees, customers and other visitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 22 July 1966, when the construction and improvement of the new road was 96% complete, approximately $ 10,000 having been expended by the plaintiff in such construction and improvement, the defendants filed their answer.  In it they deny that the proposed taking of their property is for a public purpose.  They allege that the road so constructed by the plaintiff does not benefit or serve any property owners other than Associated Transport, Inc., and, consequently, the condemnation of the defendants' property for this purpose is beyond the power of the plaintiff and unlawful.  They pray that the plaintiff be permanently enjoined from condemning and appropriating their land and that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this action be dismissed.  Alternatively, they ask that just compensation for such taking be determined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff filed a reply alleging, as affirmative defenses to the prayer for injunctive relief, the dedication of the old, narrower roadway and laches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By consent, all issues, other than the issue of just compensation if the taking be lawful, came on for hearing before the judge without a jury.  Evidence was received and the judge made findings of fact.  These include the following:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;5. That Conger Realty Company, a subsidiary corporation of Associated Transport, Inc., purchased certain real properties situated west of and adjoining the property of the defendants consisting of approximately 35 acres of land; * * * that no right of ingress or egress to said real properties existed when said properties were purchased by Conger Realty Company, and that no official employed by Conger Realty Company or Associated Transport, Inc., contacted the defendants relative to purchasing any right of way across their property to the property owned by Conger Realty Company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;6. That said real properties owned by Conger Realty Company and situated adjoining the defendants' westerly boundary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  are occupied by Associated Transport, Inc., the largest motor hauling freight carrier east of the Mississippi River, as a trucking terminal, with an annual payroll of from $ 5,000,000.00 to $ 6,000,000.00; and that construction of said trucking terminal began on said property hereinbefore designated on August 23, 1965, at which time no condemnation proceedings had been instituted by the State Highway Commission.  The construction cost of said trucking terminal was approximately $ 1,750,000.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;7. That construction of the road by the State Highway Commission across the property of the defendants to the terminal of Associated Transport, Inc., was commenced on October 6, 1965, and completed on August 23, 1966, and that since the completion of said road on the above date the road has been used by approximately 700 employees of Associated Transport, Inc., going to and from work at the terminal, Associated Transport trucks and related equipment, suppliers who come to the Associated Transport terminal for the purpose of selling supplies to Associated Transport, Inc., and its subsidiary, Brown Equipment Company, which is located at the Associated Transport terminal, service representatives&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  who come to service trucks and equipment owned by Associated Transport, Inc., and its subsidiary, customers of Associated Transport, Inc., those who deliver their products to the terminal for shipments, visitors to the Associated Transport terminal, and the tenants occupying the two tenant homes and such persons traveling to and from said tenant homes. * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;11. That Conger Realty Company, the subsidiary of Associated Transport, Inc., did not purchase the real property adjoining and lying west of defendants' property until they had been assured by the Burlington-Alamance County Chamber of Commerce that the State Highway Commission would build the access road across the defendants' property.  * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;13. That the State Highway Commission required as a condition to maintaining said condemnation proceeding that a bond be given indemnifying the State Highway Commission for any damages that it might have to pay as a result of bringing such proceeding herein, and that on August 23, 1965, such bond * * * was executed by the Burlington Industrial Corporation * * *.  That subsequently the sum of $ 7,500.00 was deposited by the Burlington Industrial Corporation under an escrow agreement with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  the State Highway Commission * * *.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;14. That the cost of construction of the road in dispute which ends in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c43">cul-de-sac</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">, was $ 9,984.48, and that on July 22, 1966, 96.6% of the road had been completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;15. That said road across the defendants' property and the place at which it terminates has no scenic value whatsoever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;16. Rules and Regulations of the State Highway Commission * * * established uniform standards which must be met before new secondary roads are added to the Highway System for maintenance.  Among these requirements * * * was the requirement that 'Roads less than one mile in length must have at least four occupied residences fronting the road or with direct entrance to the road.  * * *' That the road in question is less than one mile in length and that there have never been more than two occupied residences fronting upon either the driveway which existed prior to October 1, 1965, or the disputed roadway constructed by the State Highway Commission after that date.  * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;18. That a plat of a survey of part of the defendants' property was recorded on July 20, 1950, * * * and that said plat showed a division of part of said property into ten lots and an unlabeled&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  driveway leading from the west side of N. C. Highway 62 in a westerly direction to the west boundary of defendants' property * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;20. That at the time of the recordation of said plat and at no time subsequent thereto did the defendants intend any dedication of said private road to any governmental agency or to the State Highway Commission, * * *&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon these findings, the court concluded that the construction of this road is for the substantial and dominant use of Associated Transport, Inc., that any use by the general public is only incidental and conjectural and that the taking of the defendants' property is not for a public use.  The court further concluded that there had been no dedication by the defendants of any part of the property in question to the public use and the defendants were not guilty of laches.  Accordingly, the court entered judgment permanently enjoining the plaintiff from proceeding with the condemnation and appropriation of the land of the defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other things, Mr. Thornton testified:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;My home is about 200 feet from the north side of the road completed by the State Highway Commission that runs through my property.  * * * Since the road was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  completed in August of 1966, I have had occasion to observe vehicles traversing this 770 feet of road through my property.  The types of vehicles I have seen traveling over this road are Associated Transport transfer trucks and cars.  I have never counted the number of trucks traveling the road in a day, but it is a large number.  Trucks use the road 24 hours a day.  I have also observed cars going into this road from N. C. 62.  After you sit there and look at them day in and day out, you see certain cars go in and they carry two people, maybe a woman and a man, the man drops out and the car comes out with one person in it, or maybe vice versa.  * * * I observed the road in the process of construction.  I observed traffic on the road prior to August 23, 1966, the date the road was completed.  I could see the Associated Transport terminal under construction.  * * * There is no question that I knew all this was going on during the time construction was going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff highway commission improved a road on defendant landowners' property which led to a trucking terminal and was the terminal's only access to the highway.

On appeal the court reversed the order granting the injunction and remanded for a determination of damages due from defendant for the taking. The court found that the land was taken for a public use because employees, shippers, service suppliers, and freight carriers used the road to access the terminal. The court found that defendants did not give a public right of way by merely recording a map of the land, and that the terminal's purchase of the land at the end of defendants' road gave it no right to use the road.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action to declare void a resolution adopted December 29, 1966, and a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">proposed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> franchise ordinance referred to in said resolution, and to enjoin defendant from advertising for bids for such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">proposed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> franchise ordinance and from granting such franchise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A temporary restraining order was in effect until the final hearing at February 27, 1967 Civil Session, at which time the parties, waiving jury trial, agreed that the presiding judge should find the facts and enter his conclusions of law and judgment thereon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record contains no evidence except admissions in the pleadings and certain stipulated facts.  Defendant does not except to any of the findings of fact set forth in the judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judgment, after preliminary recitals, provides:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;. . . and the Court having found the following facts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1) Plaintiffs are residents of Cumberland County, North Carolina, doing business as a partnership under the trade name of 'Mrs. R. L. Harrelson &amp; Company.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2) Defendant is a duly created North Carolina municipal corporation owning and, through its duly constituted Fayetteville&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Airport Commission, operating a municipal airport, named Grannis Field, located about five miles south of defendant's city limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3) On 30 November 1965 the North Carolina Utilities Commission issued to plaintiffs Passenger Common Carrier Certificate No. B-207, printed certificate portion of which is attached to plaintiffs' Complaint.  The passenger common carrier authority set out in this Certificate was:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Docket No. B-207.  Passenger Common Carrier Authority.  From the intersection of U. S.

Reference: Docket No. B-23.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4) Since about November, 1965, plaintiffs have been conducting an airport passenger and luggage limousine service between Grannis Field and other points in Cumberland County, in and outside defendant's city limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5) Plaintiffs have never held any license, franchise, certificate or other explicit authority from defendant for such business, but have been conducting same with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the knowledge of defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;6) Plaintiffs have several thousands of dollars invested in buses and other equipment used for the conducting of said business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;7) On December 29, 1966, defendant, through its governing City Council, duly adopted a Resolution pursuant to which defendant, following public sealed bids, proposes to advertise for award a franchise for the furnishing of airport passenger and luggage limousine service to and from Grannis Field.  A true copy of this Resolution, proposed form of franchise embodied in an Ordinance, form for Advertisement for Bids, Bid Form, and Notice of Meetings of the City Council at which passage of the Franchise Ordinance were to be heard for adoption and award are attached to plaintiffs' Complaint and form a part of the record of this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;8) Such Franchise Ordinance provides, and the effect of such Ordinance would be, that no person to whom such a franchise had not been awarded could go upon Grannis Field for the purpose of engaging in such airport limousine business.  It further provides for regulation by defendant of fares; routes; the number, times and places of pickup and delivery at Grannis Field, on property of the United States&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and at other possible points; safety, insurance, and equipment standards; formula for amount of rental to be paid to defendant City by the franchisee; and for other operating controls by defendant over franchisee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;9) Plaintiffs have a property right in their said business and in said North Carolina Utilities Commission Certificate.

The trial court declared the ordinance void and the city appealed. The court held that granting an exclusive franchise for airport limousine service was within the powers of the city.

On 27 April 1965 her last will and testament was duly admitted to probate by the clerk of the Superior Court of Buncombe County, North Carolina, and is duly recorded in Will Book KKK, p. 417 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in the office of the clerk of the Superior Court of Buncombe County.  On 17 May 1965 Algie J. Fullam qualified as administrator c. t. a. of the estate of Lillian Clark Brock, and is now acting as such administrator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 22 March 1962 Deaver Dunsmore Brock, the second husband of Lillian Clark Brock, was adjudged incompetent to manage his affairs by the clerk of the Superior Court of Buncombe County.  On 7 April 1965 J. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  M.

Baley, Jr., as guardian of said incompetent, filed in his behalf a dissent from the will of Lillian Clark Brock, deceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lillian Clark Brock at the time of her death owned a farm in Leicester Township, Buncombe County, North Carolina.  In her last will and testament she devised to Deaver Dunsmore Brock a life interest in this farm, with remainder in fee to Algie J. Fullam, plaintiff administrator, and to Everett Clark (Items 2 and 11 of her last will and testament).  Also, in Item 2 of her will she bequeathed to her husband the sum of $ 10,000 cash, and her solitaire diamond ring.  This bequest and devise was dependent upon Deaver Dunsmore Brock surviving her, which in fact he did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everett Clark, a devisee under Item 2 of her last will and testament, questioned the right of the surviving husband to dissent from her last will and testament, upon the ground that no statute permitting a dissent by him had been enacted prior to the death of Lillian Clark Brock, and subsequent to the ratification on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  6 February 1964 of the constitutional amendment relevant thereto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Algie J. Fullam, individually and in his capacity as administrator c. t. a. of the estate of Lillian Clark Brock, instituted this civil action to obtain a declaratory judgment, pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 1-253&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, to have a determination of the rights, interests, and status of persons to whom bequests and devises were given in the will, and particularly advice and guidance in the administration of the estate as to the legal effect of the dissent of Deaver Dunsmore Brock, an incompetent person appearing by his general guardian J. M. Baley, Jr., from the last will and testament of Lillian Clark Brock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears that all parties who have or claim any interest which would be affected by this judgment have been made parties defendant and have been duly served with process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the hearing before Judge Martin, the plaintiff was represented by the Honorable Sam M. Cathey; the incompetent person, Deaver Dunsmore Brock, was represented by his general guardian, J. M. Baley, Jr., of the law firm of Parker, McGuire and Baley; the defendant, Bell Methodist Church of Leicester, North Carolina, was represented by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  John Geizentanner; and the defendant Everett Clark was represented by Lamar Gudger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court recited in its judgment that all the ultimate facts material to the judgment entered were admitted by the pleadings or were within the judicial notice of the court.  The court found as facts, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">9. &quot;That the General Assembly of North Carolina, in its 1963 Session enacted legislation directing submission of a constitutional amendment to a vote of the people whereby Article X, Section 6 of the State Constitution would be amended so as to eliminate said article's prohibition of male spouse's dissent as said article had theretofore been construed by the SUPREME COURT OF NORTH CAROLINA, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c43">Dudley v. Staton</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">, 257 N.C. 572 (1962), and in a separate section of said act stated that 'from and after the date of certification of the amendments set out in section 1 of this Act wherever the word &quot;spouse&quot; appears in the General Statutes with reference to testate or intestate successions, it shall apply alike to both husband and wife.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">10. &quot;That the said constitutional amendment to Article X, Section 6 of the North Carolina Constitution was submitted to a vote of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  people on January 14, 1964, and was approved, and that the results of said vote were certified by the Governor of the State of North Carolina on February 6, 1964.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">11. &quot;That the General Assembly of North Carolina in its 1965 Session enacted Chapter 849 which was to become effective on June 8, 1965.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based upon the above findings of fact the court made the following conclusions of law:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">1. &quot;That Article X, Section 6 of the Constitution of North Carolina was in force and effect throughout the year 1963, and placed it beyond the power of the General Assembly to restrict, abridge or impair the right of a married woman to dispose of her property by Will as if she were unmarried.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">2. &quot;That at the time of its enactment, Section 4.1 of Chapter 1209 of the Session Laws of 1963 was in contravention of Article X, Section 6 of the North Carolina Constitution and therefore void.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">3. &quot;That on March 14, 1965, at the time of the death of Lillian Clark Brock, Deaver Dunsmore Brock had no right to dissent to the Will of his deceased wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">4. &quot;That the paper writing (Exhibit &quot;2&quot; attached to plaintiff's complaint) purporting to be the dissent of Deaver Dunsmore Brock and executed by J. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  M. Baley, Jr., as his Guardian is void and of no legal force and effect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">7. &quot;That as result of the failure of the dissent of Deaver Dunsmore Brock under the court's conclusions 1 through 5 aforesaid, the funeral expenses of Lillian Clark Brock, deceased, shall be paid by the Administrator c. t. a. of her Estate pursuant to Item 1 of her Will.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based upon its findings of fact and conclusions of law, the court adjudged and decreed, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as follows: &quot;1. That the dissent of Deaver Dunsmore Brock is void and of no force and effect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the judgment Deaver Dunsmore Brock, an incompetent person, by and through his general guardian J. M. Baley, Jr., excepted and appealed.  We have not incorporated in the statement of facts the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and judgment of Judge Martin in respect to other matters sought in this action, for the simple reason that no party has excepted to a single one of them, and appealed.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of some six months' investigation of the plaintiff's activities as an insurance agent, the Commissioner of Insurance, acting under the authority of Chapter 58 of the General Statutes, suspended the insurance licenses of the plaintiff, charged him with some twenty-two violations, and set a time for hearing on the charges.  The notice was dated 25 January 1967, served on 26 January 1967, and fixed the date of the hearing for 6 February 1967, which, by second notice, was changed to 13 February 1967.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commissioner charged that in each of the cases the plaintiff had made false representations to insurance companies he represented, that the insured owned 100 per cent interest in certain tobacco lands in Lenoir County, when he knew that such claims were false.  He also charged that the plaintiff had received money for the losses so claimed, and that he had failed to properly apply the proceeds, and that the total amount for which the plaintiff was indebted to the insurance agencies was some $ 33,000.  Separate charges were made in each&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the twenty-two cases in which it was alleged that Elmore had made false representations with reference to an application for insurance against direct loss by hail and additional perils on tobacco crops and had wrongfully signed, or caused to be signed, the name of the applicants, whereby he obtained drafts from the insurance companies.  That he negotiated the drafts but did not deliver the proceeds to the named insured.  In each application the date of the alleged loss, the location of the acreage involved, and the name of the purported land owner was set forth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the date of the hearing, on 5 February 1967, the plaintiff filed four motions: (1) motion to sever; (2) motion for bill of particulars; (3) motion for continuance; (4) motion that stenographic record be kept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 8 February the Commissioner wired plaintiff's attorney that the motions would be heard on 13 February and suggested that he prepare to proceed with the hearing &quot;as scheduled in the event of the denial of motions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 13 February the plaintiff filed his own affidavit and the affidavit of his attorney, Thomas J. White, which in substance stated that the plaintiff had been unable to prepare for the hearing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  within the limited time allowed; that his attorney had many other obligations and engagements and was unable to work on the matter except at odd times; that his attorney was a member of the North Carolina Senate and Chairman of the Appropriations Committee of the Senate, and that his duties in that capacity, as well as a large legal practice, would prevent him from giving proper attention to the matter until the adjournment of the General Assembly in June 1967.  The Commissioner denied all of the plaintiff's motions except the one requesting that a stenographic record be kept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hearing was thereupon begun on Monday, 13 February, and while it was in progress, an order signed by his Honor J. William Copeland, Judge of the Superior Court, was served upon the Commissioner.  It restrained the Commissioner from proceeding further with the hearing &quot;and from doing any act or thing in furtherance thereof in prosecution of the charges&quot; and made the order returnable on 2 March 1967.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days later the Commissioner moved in Wake Superior Court that a hearing on Judge Copeland's order be had before the return date fixed therein, and as a result a hearing was set before Judge E. Maurice Braswell&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on 20 February 1967.  At that hearing the plaintiff and his attorney were present, and affidavits setting forth in detail his claims and position were filed.  The Commissioner filed counter-affidavits, and after a full hearing and arguments before Judge Braswell, the preliminary order was ordered dissolved; however, the Court ordered that pending the appeal that no further hearing or proceedings be had in the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the order dissolving the preliminary injunction the plaintiff appealed.  The defendant also appealed from the order staying the dissolution of the injunction pending the appeal.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action (No. 121 on our docket) instituted July 29, 1965, in which plaintiffs seek relief by writ of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">mandamus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or, alternatively, that an Annexation Ordinance of the Town of Beaufort be adjudged void </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ab initio</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 15, 1966, these plaintiffs instituted a separate action (No. 110 on our docket) under the Declaratory Judgment Act, seeking to have the same Annexation Ordinance declared void </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ab initio</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two cases were heard together.  A jury trial was waived.  The court's findings of fact in each case are based on the same stipulations and evidence.  An opinion in the subsequent separate action is being filed simultaneously herewith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Annexation Ordinance was adopted March 16, 1964, effective May 1, 1964, by the Board of Commissioners of the Town of Beaufort, after compliance with the procedural requirements prescribed in G.S. 160-453.5.  A public hearing was held March 2, 1964.  More than fourteen days prior thereto, a &quot;Report Setting Forth Plans as to Services to Areas to be Annexed,&quot; including a map showing existing municipal limits and the areas under&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  consideration for annexation, was filed in the office of the Town Clerk.  Owners of property in these areas appeared at the public meeting and expressed their opposition to adoption of the proposed Annexation Ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan filed in purported compliance with G.S. 160-453.3 is comprehensive, relating to (1) lights and water; (2) sewer; (3) police protection; (4) fire protection; (5) garbage collection; and (6) street maintenance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversy relates to the following provision of the plan:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. Sewer: The municipal sewerage system of the Town of Beaufort is based upon a gravity outfall towards the navigable waters that border the Town on the north and west; these two bodies of water are part of the White Oak River Basin and, as such, have been included in the State Stream and Sanitation study heretofore provided by the State Stream and Sanitation Act.  Due to the nuisance created by said system in depositing raw sewage in these navigable waters, the sewerage system of the Town of Beaufort has been declared to be obsolete and a source of unlawful pollution to adjacent streams or waters by the State Stream and Sanitation Committee, and whereas the General Assembly of North Carolina, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Session 1963, did amend subsection 3(b) of G.S. 160-453.3 by adding: 'provided, however that in the event the sewerage system of the municipality shall have been declared to be unfit, obsolete or a source of unlawful pollution to the adjacent streams or waterways by the State Stream Sanitation Committee, then the municipality shall not be required to extend any sewerage outfall into the area to be annexed; provided, further, that the area to be annexed shall be provided sewerage service on substantially the same basis and in the same manner as such service is provided within the rest of the municipality whenever a modernized sewerage system is created subject to the approval of the State Stream Sanitation Committee.' Whereas, the Town of Beaufort has employed an engineering firm to determine the feasibilities of a new sewerage system and that the said Tracts One and Two as herein described are included or will be included in said studies and that, when the new sewerage system as contemplated by the Town of Beaufort is constructed, said system will service the two areas as hereinabove described and that said areas will receive the same benefits in this regard as present portions of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the municipality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That it is further found that each of the areas at present are being serviced by septic tank systems which require attention in the form of pumping and other cleaning, and that large portions of the Town of Beaufort are now similarly serviced and that the Town of Beaufort has heretofore obtained equipment incidental to the pumping or cleaning of septic tanks and employs personnel for this purpose and this septic tank cleaning or pumping service will, on request of the individual owners in Tracts One and Two, be furnished said areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Latham concluded as matters of law that this action was timely and properly brought pursuant to G.S. 160-453.5(h); that plaintiffs had failed to show defendant did not comply with the &quot;Report Setting Forth Plans as to Services to Areas to be Annexed&quot;; and that the court was &quot;without authority to amend the plan for services to be provided to annexed areas and to force compliance to the plan as amended by the use of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">mandamus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot; Judgment was entered dismissing the action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff landowners challenged an order of the Superior Court of Carteret County (North Carolina), which dismissed their action seeking relief by way of a writ of mandamus compelling defendant town to construct a sewer system or, alternatively, to void ab initio an annexation ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The owners' land was attached to the town by an annexation ordinance. The annexation plan, filed in compliance with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160-453.3, provided that the annexed land would not be serviced by the sewerage system existing at the time the ordinance was adopted, as it was obsolete, but that the land would be serviced by a modernized sewerage system to be created by the town. In support of the town's non-liability to provide sewerage service, the plan referenced N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160-453.3. The trial court dismissed the owners' action seeking relief by way of writ of mandamus or, alternatively, to void the ordinance ab initio. The court reversed, holding that mandamus was an appropriate remedy. Although the owners were not able to challenge the annexation, they could compel the town to follow through with the plan insofar as it contemplated a new sewerage system. The town could not rely on N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160-453.3, as such was previously held to be unconstitutional. The landowners were entitled to the same benefits as other town residents, as the tax burden imposed on their property was the same as that imposed on property throughout the municipality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Title 1963 N.C. Sess. Laws 1189 amended N.C. Gen.

Laws 1189 did not apply to any other towns and it provided circumstances under which the town did not have to provide sewerage service to an annexed area. The court held that 1963 N.C. Sess. Laws 1189 was unconstitutional and void under N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 29 and noted that title 1963 N.C. Sess. Laws 1189 was a local act, relating to health and sanitation. However, while the court agreed with the trial court that 1963 N.C. Sess. Laws 1189 was unconstitutional and void, the court also held that the trial court erred in not dismissing the landowners' action because of their failure to file a petition, seeking review of the town's action pursuant to the annexation ordinance within 30 days as prescribed by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160-453.6. Additionally, the court held that the statutory remedy provided by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160.453.6 was the only procedure available to the landowners to prevent the annexation provided by the annexation ordinance and that the annexation was an accomplished fact.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff, Elizabeth Wright Fleek, a citizen and resident of Durham County, North Carolina, instituted this civil action in the Durham County Civil Court against her husband, John Sherwood Fleek, a resident either of Switzerland or Italy.  The plaintiff's purpose in bringing the action was to obtain an absolute divorce from the defendant on the ground the parties separated and have lived separate and apart for the statutory period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff alleged the parties were married in Durham, North Carolina on June 18, 1953; that they separated on June 17, 1963; that two children were born of the marriage, John Sherwood Fleek, Jr. and Elizabeth Wright Fleek, who, since the separation, have been in the exclusive custody of the plaintiff in Durham County, North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Service of process on the non-resident defendant was completed by publishing notice in a Durham County newspaper for the required period, and by mailing copies of the summons and complaint to the defendant at his last known addresses in Switzerland and in Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trial was had, the jury answered appropriate issues&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in favor of the plaintiff, and the Court entered judgment dissolving the bonds of matrimony between the parties; and awarding custody of the children to the plaintiff.  The plaintiff made a motion in the cause for an order that the defendant be required to pay the sum of $ 500 per month for the support of each of the children.  The plaintiff published notice in the newspaper and mailed copies to the defendant's last known addresses.  The defendant, through counsel, entered a special appearance, moved to quash the service, and to deny the motion upon the ground the Court was without power to enter an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">in personam</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> judgment in the absence of personal service of process on the defendant.  Judge Bane granted the motion to dismiss upon the grounds alleged.  The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court.  Judge Hasty, after hearing, affirmed the judgment of the Durham County Civil Court.

The trial court's judgment was affirmed. The court held that the husband was a non-resident of the state at the time of service of process was made upon him outside the state and that the judgment entered against the husband was not a judgment in personam, and that the orders adjudging the husband in contempt for failing to comply were improvidently entered and reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hobgood, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 12 September 1966 Civil Session of Alamance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff sued to enjoin the defendant from selling milk &quot;below cost, as that term is defined in the statute, for the purpose of injuring, harassing or destroying competition in violation of G.S. 106-266.21, as amended.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint alleges:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant is engaged in the retail grocery business in Alamance and nearby counties under the name of Big Bear Supermarkets and sells milk and other food products; it &quot;advertised and sold to the public a large number of half-gallons of milk at a price of 39 cents per half-gallon, plus sales tax&quot;; which price was &quot;below cost as that term is defined in G.S. 106-266.21, as amended (said milk having been purchased by defendant at a price of 55 cents per half-gallon)&quot;; such sale was &quot;for the purpose of injuring, harassing or destroying competition, to wit, others selling milk and other food products at retail and others operating supermarkets and retail grocery stores within the trading area of defendant's said stores&quot;; in furtherance of its plan so to sell milk, &quot;the defendant caused newspaper advertisements to be published in * * * newspapers&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  circulated in said counties * * * advertising the sale of half-gallon cartons of fresh milk at 39 cents&quot;; and it &quot;intends and plans to continue selling milk below cost,&quot; in violation of the said statute, and &quot;it is necessary in order to protect the public interest and in order to prevent further violations of said statute by the defendant that an injunction be issued * * * enjoining the defendant from further violations of said statute.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A temporary restraining order was issued and the defendant was ordered to appear and show cause why the injunction should not be continued to the final hearing of the matter in the superior court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the hearing on the order to show cause, the defendant filed its answer admitting that at its stores it advertised and sold to the public a large number of half-gallons of milk at a price of 39 cents per half-gallon, plus sales tax, which price was below cost, but denying that such sales were for the purpose of &quot;injuring, harassing or destroying competition.&quot; The answer also admits the publication of newspaper advertisements advertising the sale of halfgallon cartons of fresh milk at 39 cents.  As a further answer, the defendant alleges that in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such advertisements it advertised the sale of half-gallon cartons of milk, as well as other items, at less than cost as &quot;loss leaders&quot; for the purpose of attracting customers into its stores so that they would purchase other items in addition to those so advertised.  It is alleged that such advertisements and sales for such purpose are &quot;in accordance with the ordinary, usual and accepted method of merchandising by supermarkets and other retail grocery stores&quot;; and were &quot;not for the purpose of destructive competition and was not with the intent to injure, harass or destroy competition with others selling milk and other food products at retail and others operating supermarkets and retail grocery stores within the trading area of defendant's stores.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the hearing upon the order to show cause, the defendant demurred </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ore tenus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the complaint, which demurrer was overruled.  The matter was then heard upon affidavits.  The trial court entered an order containing its findings of fact and conclusions of law, and continuing the preliminary injunction in effect until the final hearing of the cause in the superior court.  It is from this order that the defendant appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court found&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the defendant is engaged in the retail grocery business and had made sales and published advertisements, as alleged in the complaint, the advertisements stating, &quot;Choice of any brand of fresh Milk -- 1/2 Gallon Carton 39 cents -- Limit One 1/2 Gal. Per Customer Please!&quot; The court also found that the defendant so sold the milk &quot;as a loss leader, for the purpose of attracting customers away from its competitors and luring them into defendant's stores; that the luring of said customers away from its competitors would naturally tend to harass or injure the defendant's competitors and the court finds that the sale of milk by defendant below cost was made for the purpose of injuring, harassing or destroying competition.&quot; The court further found: &quot;There has been a stated decrease in the number of Grade A milk producers in North Carolina in recent years.  There is a growing shortage of milk in North Carolina and in the nation.  Producer and consumer prices for milk in North Carolina are in line with average prices in the southeastern portion of the United States.&quot; It further found that &quot;the widespread use of milk as a loss leader would be likely to create a chaotic condition in the marketing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of milk which would be contrary to the public interest in view of the perishable nature of milk,&quot; and that &quot;it is in the public interest for the said injunction to be continued until the final hearing of this cause.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assignments of error brought forward into the appellant's brief, others being deemed abandoned, are: (1) The overruling of the demurrer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ore tenus;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (2) the findings and conclusions that the sale of milk as a &quot;loss leader&quot; would naturally tend to harass or injure competition and that the sales by the defendant below cost were made for the purpose of &quot;injuring, harassing or destroying competition&quot;; and (3) the signing of the order continuing the injunction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the affidavits introduced by the plaintiff shows that on July 28 and 29, 1966, the defendant's stores sold a total of 4,107 half-gallons of milk, on August 4 and 5 (the days on which the sales were made below cost), sold 14,611 half-gallons, and on August 11 and 12 sold 4,495 half-gallons.  Sales of milk by &quot;major stores competing&quot; with the defendant in the same cities totaled 8,631 half-gallons on July 28 and 29, 7,932 on August 4 and 5, and 8,543 on August 11 and 12.  That is, on the two days of &quot;loss&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  leader&quot; selling, the defendant sold approximately 10,000 half-gallons more than it sold on days when its prices were not below cost, whereas on those days its &quot;major&quot; competitors sold only some 700 half-gallons less than on the other days.  The explanation of the remaining 9,300 half-gallons of additional sales by the defendant is not indicated by the evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other affidavits introduced by the plaintiff tend to show that the defendant was advised of the provisions of the Milk Commission law following the appearance of its newspaper advertisement, and its president thereupon stated that the defendant was &quot;going to use milk as a loss leader by selling it below cost at 39 cents per half-gallon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The affidavit of Honorable James A. Graham, Commissioner of Agriculture of the State of North Carolina, States:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;[T]he North Carolina Milk Commission sets minimum prices to be paid to dairy farmers for their milk, but does not establish prices at any other level; that the law gives the Commission the power in certain situations to set the price of milk at other levels, but the Commission has never found it necessary or advisable to take control of milk prices at other levels; that producer&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  and consumer prices for milk in North Carolina are in line with average prices in the rest of the southeastern portion of the United States * * *&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This affiant, and others, expressed his opinion that the enforcement of G.S. 106-266.21 is in the public interest and that the widespread use of milk as a loss leader would create a chaotic condition which would have a depressing effect upon producer prices and cause many producers to go out of business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant introduced 15 affidavits by owners or operators of other supermarkets or retail stores of various sizes and locations in the trading area served by the defendant's stores.  Each of these stated:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;The retail sale of any food or milk product below cost as a 'loss leader' is an accepted and customary practice among supermarkets and other retail grocery stores, is not for the purpose of destructive competition with other retail grocers, and is not intended and does not injure, harass or destroy competition among other supermarkets and retail grocery stores.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c43">The retailer of milk cannot and does not compete with any distributor or producer-distributor of milk</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">.&quot; (Emphasis added.)</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each of these affiants stated that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the advertisements and sales by the defendant, of which the plaintiff complains, &quot;did </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">not</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> injure, harass or destroy competition among others selling milk and other food products at retail and particularly the business of your affiant.&quot; (Emphasis added.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff offered no affidavit from any operator or owner of any grocery store stating that the business of such affiant, or any other person, had been injured, harassed or destroyed or threatened with such injury, harassment or destruction by such advertisement and sales by the defendant.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court ordered continuing the preliminary injunction until the final hearing. Defendant appealed. The court found the demurrer ore tenus to the complaint was properly overruled as plaintiff's allegations were that defendant sold milk below cost as defined in section 106.266.21 and public interest in monopoly-free marketing of milk required injunctive relief. However, the court also held plaintiff's evidence was insufficient to support a finding that sales violated the statute as plaintiff failed to establish the requisite purpose which was a malevolent purpose so as to achieve, or approach, monopoly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant was charged in a bill of indictment with murder in the first degree of Edgar J. Wheatley on 15 May 1966.  The bill of indictment was returned by the Grand Jury at the August Term, and counsel was appointed to represent him.  Upon motion of the defendant, upon his claim that counsel had not had adequate time in which to prepare the case, it was continued and was tried at the December Term.  Prior to the trial, his attorney moved to quash the indictment for that the clerk of the superior court had excused from jury service persons who were exempt under the statute and that because of this certain qualified prospective jurors were not used in constituting the Grand Jury which indicted the defendant.  The defendant also moved that the State's witnesses be sequestered and further that a special venire of jurors be ordered from another county.  Each of the motions was denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The solicitor announced that he would not seek a verdict of murder in the first degree, but would seek a verdict of murder in the second degree or manslaughter, as the evidence might justify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  offered evidence tending to show that Addie Church went with the deceased, Ed Wheatley, to the house where the defendant Oxentine lived on 15 May 1966.  Several other persons were there, and all were drinking beer.  Addie Church testified that while they were talking that the defendant left the room and &quot;he came back in the other door and had a .22 rifle in his hands and shot, and I saw blood pouring out of Ed Wheatley.  No one had said anything to anybody else in anger.  Ed and Eloise had been teasing each other.  Ed Wheatley fell over in the floor.  Oxentine went out and then came back with the gun . . .  Ed was sitting in a chair in the kitchen when the gun was fired.  Fred was standing in the door about 15 feet away.  Ed was just sitting there.&quot; On cross examination, she said, &quot;There were no words said in the house.  This man just went in this room and got the gun and shot him down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gene Prestwood testified that he was also present.  He said that Eloise Coffey came in but didn't sit down.  &quot;She stood there for a little while and then left out through the kitchen door.  Fred got up and walked to the other room and came back in shooting a .22 rifle.  I heard two shots and I saw&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ed Wheatley fall over in the floor.  I seen a little blood on Ed's chest.  Ed was sitting beside me when the shots were fired.  He was still in the same chair, and he wasn't arguing with anyone.  There was no argument between any of us.  Fred was about 7 or 8 feet from Ed when he fired the two shots.  Fred then walked back in the front room and unloaded the gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">L. W. Tripplett, a deputy sheriff, testified that upon his arrival at the scene &quot;Ed Wheatley was dead, laying face down beside the kitchen table . . .  I found five beer cans.  One can was on the floor, turned over.  I touched Ed Wheatley, and I observed a wound on his body, and some blood.  When I arrived at the scene, Addie Church was crying, and I asked her what had happened, who had shot him, and she said, 'Fred Oxentine' . . . and Fred was back at the doorway of the other room, and he said, 'Yes, I shot him.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this point the defendant's counsel objected to the statement attributed to the defendant because it was made without the benefit of counsel and that he wasn't warned that anything he said might be used against him.  At his request, the jury was excused, and the court heard a statement by the defendant in which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he denied saying &quot;Yes, I shot him.&quot; He said that Officer Tripplett did not advise him that anything he said could be used against him and that he didn't hear the officer ask Addie Church what happened.  The court overruled the defendant's objection, following which the jury returned to the courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Paul Moss, the Coroner of Caldwell County, testified that he examined the body of Edgar J. Wheatley, that it &quot;had blood on the front part of his body and there was a small caliber bullet hole in the left chest, just barely above the level of the heart or the level of the border of the heart . . . that Wheatley was dead at the time of his examination and that the cause of his death was a small caliber bullet gunshot wound . . . that death was fairly sudden as the bullet struck some vital organ either the heart or a great blood vessel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the State's evidence, the defendant moved for judgment as of nonsuit, which was denied.  The defendant offered no evidence and rested and renewed his motion for judgment as of nonsuit, which was also denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of Guilty of Manslaughter, and the court ordered the defendant imprisoned for not less than fourteen&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (14) nor more than eighteen (18) years, from which the defendant appealed.  </SPAN></P>

When the deputy sheriff arrived, he asked this witness what happen and she stated that defendant shot him. Defendant stated that &quot;yes&quot; he shot the victim. The court affirmed the conviction, finding that defendant's objection to the excusal of jurors by the clerk of the superior court was not well founded because the persons exempted were entitled to claim such exemption from serving on the jury under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9-19, 90-45, 90-150, and 127-84. The court determined that there was no error in failing to give defendant his Miranda rights because his statement was voluntary and spontaneous and made while the officer was seeking information about what happened.

Nivens and Charles V. Bell, pursuant to Ch. 1080 of the Session Laws of 1963, the sum of $ 8,000, to be equally divided between them, for legal services rendered by them in the courts of the United States in behalf of Elmer Davis, Jr., an indigent defendant, whose sentence of death by asphyxiation, based upon a jury verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree, had been upheld by the Supreme Court of North Narolina in the case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">S. v. Davis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 253 N.C. 86, 116 S.E. 2d 365, in an opinion filed 12 October 1960, which fee of $ 8,000 was allowed them in addition to the sum of $ 1,700 formerly paid to them by Mecklenburg County by order of court for their legal services in defending the said Elmer Davis, Jr., in the courts of the State of North Carolina.  Docketed and argued as Case No. 272-L, Fall Term 1966.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The history of this case is as follows: At the 2 November 1959 Term of the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County the grand jury returned&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a true bill of indictment charging that Elmer Davis, Jr., on 20 September 1959 with force and arms at and in Mecklenburg County did unlawfully, willfully, and feloniously while perpetrating a felony, to wit, rape, kill, and murder Foy Bell Cooper.  On 10 November 1959 Francis O. Clarkson, Judge presiding over the court in Mecklenburg County, entered an order finding that the said Elmer Davis, Jr., is an indigent person charged in an indictment with the capital felony of murder in the first degree, and appointed Walter B. Nivens and Charles V. Bell to represent him &quot;in the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina.&quot; Upon this indictment the said Elmer Davis, Jr., was tried by Campbell, J., and a jury at the 7 December 1959 Regular Criminal Term of Mecklenburg County Superior Court.  Upon his arraignment defendant through his court-appointed counsel, Nivens and Bell, entered a plea of not guilty.  The jury returned for its verdict, &quot;Guilty of murder in the first degree.&quot; From a judgment of death in the manner prescribed by law, defendant appealed.  Upon his appeal the SUPREME COURT OF NORTH CAROLINA found no error in the trial below.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">S. v. Davis, supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Thereafter, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  said Nivens and Bell, court-appointed counsel for Elmer Davis, Jr., petitioned the SUPREME COURT OF NORTH CAROLINA for a rehearing, which motion was denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the denial of their petition for rehearing by the SUPREME COURT OF NORTH CAROLINA, the said Nivens and Bell procured from the North Carolina Supreme Court a stay of execution of the death sentence of Elmer Davis, Jr., and filed a petition for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> before the United States Supreme Court.  The United States Supreme Court denied the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  Mr. Justice Douglas was of the opinion that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should be granted.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Davis v. State of North Carolina</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 365 U.S. 855, 5 L. Ed. 2d 819 (20 March 1961).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, the said Nivens and Bell filed a petition in behalf of the said Elmer Davis, Jr., who was in the custody of the State of North Carolina under sentence of death, for a writ of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">habeas corpus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, Raleigh Division.  Butler, Chief Judge for the United States District Court for the Eastern District, filed an elaborate written opinion on 25 July 1961 denying the writ.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Davis v. State of North Carolina</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 196 F. Supp. 488.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Petitioners, in behalf of the said Elmer Davis, Jr., appealed to the United States Court of Appeals, which court in a majority opinion, with Haynsworth, J., dissenting, reversed Judge Butler's decision and remanded the case to the Federal District Court for a rehearing on the question of whether defendant's confession was obtained within the bounds of due process.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Davis v. State of North Carolina</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 310 F. 2d 904, decided 7 November 1962.  Upon the rehearing, pursuant to the mandate of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Butler wrote an elaborate opinion again denying the petition for a writ of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">habeas corpus.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Davis v. State of North Carolina</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 221 F. Supp. 494. The opinion was filed 10 September 1963.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The said Nivens and Bell, in behalf of the said Elmer Davis, Jr., appealed again to the United States Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, which court in a majority opinion joined in by three judges, with two dissenting, affirmed Judge Butler's decision in an opinion filed 8 December 1964.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Davis v. State of North Carolina</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 339 F. 2d 770. The said Nivens and Bell, according to a petition for the allowance of counsel fees for their appearances for the said Elmer Davis, Jr., &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the United States courts, allege that they again filed a petition for a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with the United States Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court of the United States granted the petition for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the following language:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;No. 37, Misc.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c43">Davis v. North Carolina</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">.  C. A. 4th Cir.

The case is transferred to the appellate docket.  Conrad O. Pearson for petitioner.  T. W. Bruton, Attorney General of North Carolina, and James F. Bullock, Assistant Attorney General, for respondent.  Reported below: 339 F. 2d 770.&quot; 382 U.S. 953, 15 L. Ed. 2d 358.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 30 June 1966 the Supreme Court of the United States, in an opinion written by Chief Justice Warren expressing the views of six members of the Court, held that the confession of Elmer Davis, Jr., was involuntary and inadmissible in evidence.  Mr. Justice Clark, in an opinion joined in by Mr. Justice Harlan, dissented on the ground that the findings supported the conclusion that the confession was voluntary.  The majority opinion reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and remanded the case to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  District Court to enter &quot;such orders as are appropriate and consistent with this opinion, allowing the State a reasonable time in which to retry the petitioner.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Davis v. State of North Carolina</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 384 U.S. 737, 16 L. Ed. 2d 895.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 19 July 1966 Walter B. Nivens and Charles V. Bell filed a petition in Mecklenburg County Superior Court stating in substance: Your petitioners have put in many hours in research, preparation of briefs, and perfection of appeals in the various courts of the United States (which we have set forth above); that they have incurred expenses in the amount of $ 1,758.72 in connection with their work in the Federal courts; that they have sought and obtained the assistance of another attorney in doing research; and that they are of the opinion that the reasonable value of their services rendered in all of these proceedings in the Federal courts, aside from the outlay of expenses, amounted to $ 30,000.  Wherefore, they prayed the State court to enter an order that they be reimbursed for their expenses in the amount of $ 1,758.72 and be allowed attorney fees of $ 15,000 each.  They filed as an exhibit to their petition an itemized statement of their alleged expenses&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in representing Elmer Davis, Jr., in the Federal courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State of North Carolina filed an answer to the petition of Nivens and Bell for expenses and counsel fees for their appearances for Elmer Davis, Jr., in the United States courts, in which it alleges in substance: That the State of North Carolina is not liable for and is not authorized by law to pay any counsel fees and expenses to any attorney for services performed in the United States courts; that petitioners Nivens and Bell have been compensated for their legal services in behalf of the defendant in both the Superior and Supreme Courts of North Carolina by the payment to them of $ 1,700 as fees by Mecklenburg County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The County of Mecklenburg filed an answer to the request of Nivens and Bell for expenses and counsel fees in the United States courts, in which it alleges in substance: That it has paid to Nivens and Bell by order of court the sum of $ 1,700 for legal services rendered by them to Elmer Davis, Jr., in his trial in the Superior Court, the SUPREME COURT OF NORTH CAROLINA, and on a motion for rehearing in the State Supreme Court; that since the enactment of Ch. 1080 of the Session Laws of 1963, the State of North&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Carolina is responsible for the payment of legal fees for indigent defendants charged with crime in the State courts; and that it is not responsible, certainly since the legislation of 1963, for the payment of counsel fees for an indigent defendant in the United States courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 13 October 1966 McLean, J., allowed petitioners Nivens and Bell to amend their petition for counsel fees to allege: &quot;That the failure to allow these petitioners attorney fees for the defendant herein for their services expended in the Federal Courts of the United States is a denial of their rights under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and a deprivation of their rights under the Constitution of North Carolina.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge McLean on 14 October 1966 heard the petition of the said Nivens and Bell for an allowance of attorney fees for their representation of Elmer Davis, Jr., in the United States courts.  He entered a judgment wherein, after reciting the history of the case as we have set forth above, he stated in substance: That the State of North Carolina elected not to retry Elmer Davis, Jr., for the rape and murder of Foy Bell Cooper, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and he was thereafter ordered released from the State Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina, by the Honorable Algernon Butler, Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina; that the Attorney General's office and the solicitor of the Mecklenburg solicitorial district represented the State of North Carolina in the United States courts, that it is stipulated by all the parties that the expenses incurred by the petitioners herein in representing the defendant Davis in the courts of the United States amounted to $ 1,758.72; and that during all the proceedings Elmer Davis, Jr., was an indigent.  When Nivens and Bell were appointed to represent Elmer Davis, Jr., Mecklenburg County was liable to pay them reasonable attorney fees, and that Mecklenburg County did pay these petitioners the sum of $ 1,700 for their services, and that since 21 June 1963 the responsibility for paying attorney fees for indigent defendants was placed upon the State of North Carolina pursuant to the provisions of Ch. 1080 of the Session Laws of 1963.  This case originated in the North Carolina State courts and hence the State of North Carolina is liable for payment of attorney&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fees due these petitioners; that the State of North Carolina paid all costs assessed by the government which covered the costs in the United States District Court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, and the United States Supreme Court in the amount of $ 3,700; that a refusal to pay these petitioners their fees for representing Elmer Davis, Jr., in the Federal courts is a denial of their rights under the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and a deprivation of their rights under the Constitution of North Carolina.  Wherefore, Judge McLean ordered and decreed that the State of North Carolina pay to petitioners Nivens and Bell &quot;out of the Indigent Defense Fund established pursuant to Chapter 1080 of the General Session Laws of 1963&quot; the sum of $ 8,000 for their appearances for the defendant Davis in the United States courts, which amount is to be equally divided between the petitioners herein, and said amount is allowed in addition to the $ 1,700 heretofore paid them by Mecklenburg County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 14 October 1966 McLean, J., entered an order staying the execution of his order for the payment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of counsel fees to Nivens and Bell until the State of North Carolina could have his order for the payment of counsel fees reviewed by the Supreme Court, on condition that the State of North Carolina file application for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> within 15 days from 14 October 1966.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 20 October 1966 the Attorney General of the State of North Carolina filed a petition for a writ of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for a review by the Supreme Court of Judge McLean's order ordering the payment of $ 8,000 for counsel fees to the petitioners.  We allowed the petition for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on 4 November 1966.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal prosecution based on a warrant issued May 22, 1965, by &quot;R. F. Johnson, Desk Officer,&quot; on affidavit of C. G. Smith, a Raleigh Police Officer, charging that defendant, on said date, operated an automobile on designated public streets of Raleigh while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.  After trial and conviction in the City Court of Raleigh, defendant appealed from the judgment there pronounced to the superior court for trial </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a trial in superior court on November 16, 1965, the jury was unable to agree on a verdict and a mistrial was ordered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the case came on for (second) trial on October 13, 1966, defendant's counsel moved &quot;to quash the warrant.&quot; Judge Braswell elected, in his discretion, to entertain the motion; and, after consideration thereof, entered an order which, after recitals, provides:</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant was tried upon a charge of driving under the influence. The jury could not reach a verdict, and a mistrial was declared. When the cause for a second trial, defendant moved to quash the warrant. Defendant challenged the arrest warrant because it was issued by a desk officer instead of by a justice of the peace. The trial court allowed defendant's motion and dismissed the warrant on the ground that the statutes purporting to confer authority to issue arrest warrants on desk officers, 1963 N.C. Sess. Laws 1093 and 1963 N.C. Sess. Laws 1261, were unconstitutional.. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that 1963 N.C. Sess. Laws 1093 and 1963 N.C. Sess. Laws 1261were invalid for failure to meet the requirements of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. A desk officer appointed by his chief of police, as provided in the statutes, did not have the status of a neutral and detached magistrate when considering an affidavit for an arrest warrant.</SPAN></P>

Docketed and argued as Case No. 115, Fall Term 1966.  Docketed as Case No. 123, Spring Term 1967.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action brought by plaintiffs, citizens and residents of Carteret County, on behalf of themselves severally and jointly and on behalf of all others similarly situated, under the provisions of the North Carolina Declaratory Judgment Act.  G.S. 1-253&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants are Carteret County, the members of its Board of County Commissioners, the members of its Board of Elections, and the Attorney General of the State of North Carolina, who was made a party pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 1-260.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs seek to have declared unconstitutional two Acts of the North Carolina General Assembly, to wit: Ch. 1043 of the Session Laws of 1963 entitled, &quot;An Act to Provide for the Nomination and Election of the Board of County Commissions (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) of Carteret County,&quot; and Ch. 723 of the Session Laws of 1965 entitled, &quot;An Act to Amend Chapter 1043, Session&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Laws of 1963, Relating to the Nomination and Election of the County Commissioners of Carteret County,&quot; and for an order of court declaring the present Board of County Commissioners of Carteret County to be unlawfully and improperly constituted, and further for an order of court directing primary and general elections to be held immediately to elect five County Commissioners from Carteret County pursuant to law.  The relief demanded is based upon the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees to plaintiffs due process of law and equal protection under the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ch. 1043 of the 1963 Session Laws is entitled, &quot;An Act to Provide for the Nomination and Election of the Board of County Commissions (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) of Carteret County.&quot; The Act established four political districts in Carteret County and provided for the election of five members of the Board of County Commissioners.  It became effective beginning with the 1964 primary.  Under its provisions, candidates are nominated in the primary by the qualified voters of their respective districts.  At the general election, the vote is county-wide.  The term of office established by the Act was two years, to begin the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  first Monday in December, 1964.  The complaint alleges in substance: Pursuant to the provisions of this Act, the defendants herein designated the &quot;Board of County Commissioners of Carteret County&quot; were nominated in their respective districts and elected in the general election following, and assumed the office of County Commissioners in December, 1964.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint alleges that the Board of County Commissioners of Carteret County procured the enactment by the General Assembly of North Carolina of Ch. 723 of the 1965 Session Laws to amend Ch. 1043 of the 1963 Session Laws.  It made certain changes in the geographical boundaries of the political districts established by the 1963 Act, changed the term of office of members of the Board of County Commissioners of Carteret County from two to four years, effective as of the 1968 general election, and extended the terms of office of the members of the Board elected in 1964 for two additional years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs allege that under the provisions of the above Acts, according to the last official United States Census, District 1, which is authorized two Commissioners, has a population of 13,556 or 43.81 per cent of the total county population, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  District 2 has a population of 4,429 or 14.31 per cent of the county population, District 3 has a population of 7,219 persons or 23.33 per cent of the county population, and that District 4 contains 5,736 persons or 18.54 per cent of the county total.  They allege that this is improper apportionment under which the vote of a resident of District 2 is 1.63 times greater than that of a resident of District 3.  Plaintiffs' complaint is directed to the alleged unequal representation or improper apportionment resulting from the above two Acts of the General Assembly, thereby allegedly depriving them of due process of law and equal protection of the law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and further to the extension of the terms of office of the members of the Board of County Commissioners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;That an action was instituted by the plaintiffs herein in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina against the defendants herein named for causes as hereinabove set forth, said action being predicated upon the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. 2201-2202, to which complaint&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  the defendants County Commissioners and County Board of Elections answers and did file, as an element of their answer, a resolution of the County Board of Commissioners adopted at their regular meeting on the first Monday in February, 1966, which resolution, in effect, found that the previous apportionment of commissioner districts in Carteret County were denied equal representation on the Board of County Commissioners and that, further, said defendants, County Board of Commissioners, redistricted said county, creating new districts.  That said resolution has been made a part of the minutes of the defendants, County Board of Commissioners, which minutes are, by reference, incorporated herein and made a part hereof.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alleged minutes are not in the record before us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paragraph 13 of the complaint alleges:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;That the said Commissioners as named herein are still holding office and, despite the fact that they have found themselves to have been elected under improperly created districts, they are still attempting to hold office accordingly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On motion of the defendants, with the exception of the Attorney General of North Carolina, Bone, J., struck out paragraph 14 of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  complaint, which alleges:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;That the said action filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina has resulted in an opinion and order by the Hon.

The Court further ordered that the Court shall retain jurisdiction until such time as a final order can be entered in the State court system (North Carolina).  Therefore, the status of the defendants, County Commissioners, has not been determined and is still undetermined.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Docketed and argued as No. 766 at Fall Term 1966.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action brought under the Declaratory Judgment Act ( G.S. 1-253 through 1-267) to have declared invalid and void a referendum election conducted in the City of Reidsville, County of Rockingham, to determine whether liquor stores might be established within the City of Reidsville, and further to have declared unconstitutional Chapter 650 of the 1965 Session Laws of North Carolina: An Act To Allow The City Council And The Qualified Voters Of The City Of Reidsville To Determine Whether Or Not Alcoholic Beverage Control Stores Shall Be Established In Said City, And To Prescribe The Disposition Of The Net Funds Thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chapter 650 of the 1965 Session Laws was ratified on 20 May 1965, to become effective 1 July 1965.  The Act is summarized, and in pertinent part quoted, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 1 provides that upon petition of fifteen percent of the qualified voters who voted in the last preceding election for City Council members, the City Council of the City of Reidsville may hold an election on the question of whether or not City Alcoholic&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Beverage Control Stores may be operated within the City of Reidsville, and that such election shall be conducted pursuant to the same rules and regulations applicable to general elections for the City Council of the City of Reidsville, with the cost of the election to be borne by the general funds of the City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 3 provides for the establishment and maintaining of a City Board of Alcoholic Control in the event the vote is in favor of authorization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 4 provides that the City Board shall have all the powers and duties imposed by G.S. 18-45 on County Boards; shall be subject to the same powers and authority of the State Board as are County Boards under G.S. 18-39; and the operation of any City Alcoholic Beverage Control Stores shall be subject to and in pursuance of the provisions of Article 3 of Chapter 18 of the General Statutes, except where in conflict with this Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 5 provides for the disbursement of the net profits derived from operation of Alcoholic Beverage Control Stores within the City of Reidsville.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Section 6.  In the event the County Commissioners of Rockingham County call an election on the question of whether or not Alcoholic Beverage Control&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  Stores shall be established in the county and before an election is held in the City of Reidsville under the provisions of this Act, and if a majority of the voters in the City of Reidsville who vote in the county election vote against establishing liquor stores in Rockingham County, then no election shall be held under the authority of this Act within 3 years after the date of the county election.  . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A county-wide election was conducted in Rockingham County on 27 July 1965, wherein a majority of the voters voted against the establishment of liquor stores in Rockingham County.  Five of the thirty precincts within the county lie partially within and partially without the city limits of Reidsville.  One of the thirty lies wholly within the city limits.  The majority of the aggregate vote of these six precincts was against the establishment of an ABC system, the vote being 1825 to 1786.  However, as a result of the manner in which the election was conducted, it was (and is) impossible to determine how a majority of the voters </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">within the City of Reidsville</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cast their vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 23 October 1965 a municipal election was conducted within the City of Reidsville, where only those&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  registered voters who resided within the city limits were allowed to vote.  The result of the election was 1,659 in favor of the establishment of liquor stores in the City of Reidsville and 1,628 opposed to liquor stores within the City of Reidsville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to the &quot;Reidsville Act&quot;, an Alcoholic Beverage Control Board was subsequently appointed and an Alcoholic Beverage Control system put in operation.  Thereafter, plaintiff brought this action, including as defendants the City of Reidsville and the members of the City of Reidsville Alcoholic Beverage Control Board.  Trial by jury was waived by consent of the parties, and the case came on for trial on the pleadings, affidavits, and stipulated facts.  The trial court rendered judgment in favor of defendants.  Plaintiff appeals.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant taxpayer sought review of a judgment from the Regular Civil Session of Rockingham (North Carolina), which was in favor of appellees, a city and the members of the city's alcohol beverage commission. The taxpayer had brought a civil action under the Declaratory Judgment Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-253 through -267.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">A county-wide election was conducted and a majority of the voters voted against the establishment of liquor stores in the county. Some of the precincts were both in the county and in the city, and one was solely in the city, but the vote total in the city could not be tabulated. Then a municipal election was held in the city and the voters voted to permit liquor stores in the city. The taxpayer claimed that the vote in the city was unlawful because 1965 N.C. Sess. Laws 650, &sect; 6 provided that no election could be held in the city on this question for three years after an election in the county where a majority of the city voters voted against the establishment of liquor store. The court affirmed the trial court, holding that it was impossible to determine if a majority of the city residents had voted &quot;no&quot; in the earlier county election. The court further held that that 1965 N.C. Sess. Laws 650, &sect; 6 did not violate N.C. Const. art II, &sect; 29, because it did not deal with local laws that regulated the trade of a business. Rather, the sale of intoxicating liquors by the state was not a trade, but was a valid exercise of the state's police powers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Original plaintiffs instituted this action for injunctive relief on August 6, 1964, and then obtained an order extending the time for filing complaint.  On August 19, 1964, they filed a complaint and an affidavit and motion for a temporary restraining order; and on that date Judge Mallard signed an order temporarily restraining defendant &quot;from exercising the option held by it from M. A. Abernethy to acquire, or acquiring, a 1.6-acre tract of land situate on the east side of North Columbia Street in the Town of Chapel Hill and from using or attempting to use said property for the location of a public housing project,&quot; and fixing the time and place for a hearing to determine whether the temporary order should be continued until final determination of the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 3, 1964, Judge Mallard signed an order which, after reciting a hearing on a motion of defendant to strike portions of said complaint, (1) struck designated portions thereof and allowed plaintiffs twenty days to file an amended complaint, and (2) fixed a new time and place for the hearing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to determine whether the restraining order should be continued </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">pendente lite</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on September 22, 1964, alleging therein, stated separately, a cause of action and a &quot;further cause of action,&quot; referred to hereafter as first cause of action and second cause of action, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matters set forth in the following numbered paragraphs (our numbering) are alleged in both causes of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was created and organized pursuant to the provisions of G.S. Chapter 157.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiffs reside and own property within the residential area of Chapel Hill known as Noble Heights, a subdivision bounded on the west by Pritchard Avenue, on the north by Noble Street and on the east by North Columbia Street.  Noble Street, approximately 100 yards long, &quot;extends only between North Columbia Street and Pritchard Avenue.&quot; Neither North Columbia Street nor Pritchard Avenue is a through street, each being a narrow, paved residential street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The property of (original) plaintiffs is located on Noble Street or Pritchard Avenue &quot;within a distance of 200 to 400 feet of the Abernethy property.&quot; &quot;(T)he residences of the (original) plaintiffs and practically&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  all of the structures located within and adjacent to this area are privately owned and occupied single-family residential structures, the area being almost exclusively developed and occupied by private homes, with the exception of the Abernethy site.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Many others reside and own property within Noble Heights and the area adjacent thereto whose property &quot;is situated in as close proximity to the . . .  Abernethy property as is the plaintiffs', and whose interest in this cause is similar to that of the plaintiffs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the matters set forth in the above numbered paragraphs, allegations of the first cause of action continue as set forth below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surveys made by or for defendant reveal that the areas of Chapel Hill in which substandard, unsafe and unsanitary dwelling structures were located and where safe and sanitary dwelling accomodations were needed were &quot;in the western and northwestern area of the Town of Chapel Hill, being the areas occupied by members of the Negro race.&quot; Subsequent to these survey findings, defendant &quot;selected and approved several sites in the western and northwestern sections of Chapel Hill, which sites consisted of improved and unimproved real estate, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  majority of the improved being substandard and unsanitary; that at least two of said sites were selected and approved, each being in the area where the need for adequate housing existed and in areas which would be improved by the construction of public housing facilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paragraphs IX and X, stricken by an order of Judge Mallard dated October 8, 1964, are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;IX. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and upon such information and belief, allege that such sites were thereafter submitted for approval to the Public Housing Authority but that said Authority declined to approve said sites and its representatives, after conferring with various persons, groups and organizations in the community, rejected them and directed that they not be approved since the areas in which they were located were not substantial developed residential areas of the community, would not assure racial integration, and would not serve the ends sought to be accomplished by such various other persons, groups and organizations whose aims were not those of the Housing Authorities Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;X. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and upon such information and belief, allege that subsequent to the action of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Public Housing Authority, the Chapel Hill Housing Authority then considered sites on the basis of what the Public Housing Authority would approve, rather than those where better housing was needed, such sites being within the well-developed residential areas of Chapel Hill and in those areas occupied by members of the Caucasian race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Public Housing Authority &quot;advised that it would approve a site previously selected by the Authority in the western section of Chapel Hill and adjacent thereto if incorporated within the town and if the local Authority would approve, select and acquire the 1.6-acre (Abernethy) tract located on North Columbia Street adjacent to the Noble Heights area . . . and any other site selected through approval of the Public Housing Authority.&quot; In June 1964, defendant &quot;agreed to approve, select, and acquire both such sites, which the Public Housing Authority would approve and any other property satisfactory to the Public Housing Authority and which it would approve for the purpose of constructing low rental public housing without consideration or regard for the interests of the community, the character of the area in which such site might be located, the need&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for low rental public housing in the area, the effect of such selection, acquisition, and development on the social, economic, political or practical interest of the community or its citizens, residents or property owners, the well-being, harmony, welfare, health, happiness of the residents of the area and the well-being and best interests of the tenants and without regard to whether such site were a fit or proper site for the construction of low rental public housing, the sole consideration being the approval or disapproval of the Federal Public Housing Authority, or its representatives or agents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to the blanket authorization to acquire sites which the Public Housing Authority would approve, including the Abernethy site, defendant, during the month of July 1964, &quot;procured from one M. A. Abernethy an option to purchase the 1.6-acre tract located on North Columbia Street at the intersection of Noble Street adjacent to the Noble Heights area as hereinbefore described, for the purpose of constructing thereon low rental public housing, although it would not eliminate a single occupied slum structure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant selected and has attempted to acquire the Abernethy tract wholly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by reason of the external pressures applied by the Public Housing Authority and by persons, groups and organizations </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">&quot;desirous of integrating the races in housing within the corporate limits of the Town of Chapel Hill,&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and not on account of its being a proper location for public housing.  Defendant has heretofore approved and abandoned &quot;many previous prospective sites.&quot; Although the Abernethy site involved &quot;is an insubstantial portion of the over-all public housing project proposed for Chapel Hill and is not connected with any other prospective site,&quot; the Public Housing Authority and defendant &quot;have taken the position that unless this site is acquired and developed, there will be no public housing in the Chapel Hill community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Abernethy site consists primarily of vacant land in a well developed residential neighborhood in which the structures are substantial, safe, sanitary and well above minimum standards.  Location of low cost public housing apartment units in this &quot;already densely populated&quot; area would cause congestion, increase traffic hazards and in general &quot;greatly devalue&quot; the surrounding property.  Within a few hundred yards, with different access, areas are available&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to defendant where there is a need for adequate housing facilities; and in these areas construction of low cost public housing apartment units will enhance the value of the surrounding property.  Defendant's selection of the Abernethy site is arbitrary, capricious and constitutes an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paragraph XVIII, stricken by an order of Judge Mallard dated November 4, 1964, is as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That plaintiffs are informed and believe that the actions of the Public Housing Authority in directing the selection of sites through approval or disapproval has been controlled, influenced and directed on the basis of integration of the races rather than a desire to provide low rental public housing for those in need and/or the elimination of the slum areas of the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Abernethy property is the only site defendant &quot;purports to select and acquire which would have the effect of placing low rental public housing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">in an area occupied by members of the Caucasian race and in which enforced integration of the races would occur and</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in an area which would be down graded or depreciated in value through the construction of such facilities, or in which the existing structures are adequate, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  safe, sanitary and equal to or superior to those to be provided by public housing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant &quot;persists in its attempts to acquire the Abernethy property solely by reason of the dictates of the Public Housing Authority </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">and the pressures by those persons desiring to convert public housing into an instrument of integration of the races</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and not the purposes for which it is properly used of improving the standards of an area and affording decent, safe and sanitary housing accommodations for persons of low income.&quot; Defendant has abdicated the discretion vested in it by law, basing its determination of sites &quot;on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">race factors and</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> other extraneous factors&quot; and not on the basis of whether it is a proper and suitable site for public housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The construction of low rental public housing apartments on the Abernethy property will substantially change the character of the neighborhood, render plaintiffs' properties less desirable for residential purposes, depreciate the value of plaintiffs' properties, etc., and thereby cause plaintiffs to suffer irreparable injury for which they have no adequate remedy at law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the matters set forth in the above numbered paragraphs, allegations&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the second cause of action continue as set forth below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July 1964, defendant procured from M. A. Abernethy an option to purchase said 1.6-acre tract.  Prior thereto, two members of defendant had resigned and have not, since June 1964, acted as members of defendant.  A third member of defendant, who has stated his intention to resign, was &quot;without the continental United States&quot; when the option was obtained.  Under G.S. Chapter 157, defendant consists of five members; and no meeting, with a quorum present, was held to approve the option price, to authorize the exercise of the option or to acquire the property pursuant to the option.  The agents of defendant, without authority, &quot;have arbitrarily proceeded to attempt to exercise the option and acquire the Abernethy property.&quot; There being no authorization therefor, said action was arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allegations in the second cause of action, as to irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law, are substantially the same as those in the first cause of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon motion of defendant, Judge Mallard struck from the complaint Paragraphs IX, X and XVIII and the phrases italicized above from Paragraphs XIV, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  XIX, XXI and XXII.  Plaintiffs excepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By order of October 8, 1964, Judge Mallard </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">vacated and dissolved</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the portion of the temporary restraining order of August 19, 1964, that enjoined defendant from exercising the option, but </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">continued until the final hearing</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the portion of said restraining order that enjoined the defendant from &quot;using or attempting to use&quot; said property.  Plaintiffs excepted to the first part of the order; defendant to the latter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant filed answer on November 6, 1964.  The record contains an &quot;Order of Mistrial&quot; entered by Judge Braswell at March Civil Session 1965.  This order indicates that, after the jury had been selected and impaneled, the presiding judge, in the exercise of his discretion and on grounds not pertinent to this appeal, withdrew a juror and ordered a mistrial, continuing in effect the temporary restraining order of August 19, 1964, as modified by the order of October 8, 1964.  By order of September 27, 1965, Judge Johnson, in accordance with their petitions, ordered that additional plaintiffs be made parties in this cause; and, as permitted by Judge Johnson's order, these additional plaintiffs filed complaints in which they adopted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as their own the amended complaint of original plaintiffs.  Defendant answered these complaints by adopting in respect of the additional plaintiffs its answer to the amended complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff property owners challenged a decision of an Orange County trial court (North Carolina), which sustained the demurrer ore tenus that was filed by defendant housing authority. The restraining order that was issued remained in force pending appeal. The owners had sought to restrain the housing authority from exercising its option to acquire a tract of land and from using or attempting to construct a housing project on the land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The owners based their alleged right to maintain this action solely on their status as residents and property owners. Their alleged grievance was that the construction by the housing authority of low rental public housing apartments would seriously and adversely affect the desirability of their property for residential use and substantially depreciate its value. The court found that under the facts as alleged, the owners did not have a right to restrain the housing authority or any individual from acquiring the tract of land and constructing low rental apartment units thereon. Under the Housing Authorities Law, the housing authority had wide latitude and discretion in the selection and location for such a project. The housing authority's primary objective was to make low rental public housing available to persons who were living in substandard, unsafe, and unsanitary dwelling structures. The complaint alleged no facts sufficient to show the selection of the tract was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. Finally, the owners could not challenge the internal affairs and functioning of the housing authority commission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hasty, Special Judge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, October 10, 1966 Non-Jury Session of Guilford, Greensboro Division, docketed and argued as No. 698 at Fall Term 1966.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action for injunctive relief, instituted June 28, 1966, heard below on defendants' demurrer to complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff alleged in substance, except where quoted, the matters set forth in the following numbered (our numbering) paragraphs:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff and individual defendants are residents of Guilford County, &quot;a body corporate and politic.&quot; Defendants Kennedy and Cox are Inspections Director and Planning Director, respectively, of Guilford County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiff is the owner of a described tract of land in said county containing 4.5 acres, more or less, located &quot;approximately 7,000 feet from the northern end of Runway No. 5-23 of the airport operated by the Greensboro-High Point Airport Authority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A two-story frame dwelling and a one-story cinder block building are located on said property.  &quot;For approximately one year prior to June 8, 1966,&quot; plaintiff and his family resided in said dwelling; and plaintiff, by his own efforts and at substantial expense, had renovated said cinder block building for use as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a woodworking shop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Airport Authority has maintained Runway No. 5-23 for many years for the purpose of accommodating aircraft during takeoff and landing; and, &quot;(u)ntil some time in 1965,&quot; such aircraft passed directly over said property without unreasonable and oppressive interference with the use thereof.  In recent months, however, &quot;the Airport Authority </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">has announced its intention</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to extend the runway 2000 feet northeasterly and the approach 2700 feet from the end thereof, to accommodate larger jet aircraft.&quot; (Our italics.) Now, &quot;larger and noisier aircraft are using the runway; the frequency of such flights has vastly increased; the aircraft have begun to fly over the property at lower altitudes and interference with the use and enjoyment of surrounding real estate in general and with plaintiff's property in particular has been much increased.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. &quot;Aircraft using Runway 5-23 now pass directly over plaintiff's real property at altitudes substantially less than 150 feet, at all hours of the day and night.  The landing lights of such aircraft brightly illuminate the property during the evening and morning hours; the noise and wind generated by their engines cause plaintiff's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  buildings to vibrate, windows to rattle and crack and the mortar joints and plaster to separate.  Such flights have placed plaintiff and his family in fear of bodily harm, have repeatedly startled and awakened them from sleep, and have caused them great inconvenience and embarrassment by disruption of conversation and television reception.&quot; On account of these conditions, on June 7, 1966, plaintiff and his family were forced to move their residence from said premises.  The cinder block building can be used for no practical purpose.  Most of the land &quot;is now lying fallow.&quot; The flights of aircraft have &quot;rendered the property useless for development as residential property and impractical for development as a farm (the only uses permitted under Zoning Regulations), and thus substantially (have) impaired the value of the real estate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Under zoning regulations adopted in 1964 by the Board of Commissioners of Guilford County, a portion of plaintiff's property fronting on State Road No. 2137 is in the highest classification of the Guilford County Zoning Ordinance, that is, it is restricted to use for a one-family residence.  The portion so restricted includes the dwelling, the yard used&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  therewith, and a small portion of the cinder block building.  The remaining portion, including the greater part of the cinder block building, is zoned for agricultural purposes.  The cinder block building cannot be used as a residence and no </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">bona fide</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agricultural use thereof is practicable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. In February 1966, plaintiff's application to the Guilford County Inspections Department for an electrical permit so that the cinder block building could be used as a woodworking shop was denied because that use was prohibited by said zoning restrictions.  Advised to do so by defendant Kennedy, plaintiff filed an application that his property be rezoned to permit its use for industrial purposes.  At the hearing before the Guilford County Planning Board, defendant Cox opposed plaintiff's said application on the ground the Planning Department did not &quot;know the long-range needs of the airport, in regard to the road leading to the property,&quot; and the Planning Board denied plaintiff's application.  Plaintiff appealed to the Board of County Commissioners.  &quot;In the interim, all individuals owning property fronting on public road 2137, and adjacent to that of plaintiff, and all property owners who&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  could conceivably be affected by the requested zoning change, joined in plaintiff's petition to have the property rezoned.  The Guilford County Board of Commissioners nevertheless denied the request for rezoning on June 6, 1966.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. &quot;Because of the close proximity of aircraft on takeoff and landing, plaintiff's property is wholly unsuitable for development restricted to the uses permitted by zoning.&quot; Under present conditions, &quot;the zoning of plaintiff's property for single-family residence and agricultural uses is an unreasonable, capricious, confiscatory and arbitrary action of the zoning authority in that it renders development of plaintiff's property a practical impossibility&quot;; and &quot;(t)he Zoning Ordinance is therefore invalid with respect to plaintiff's property.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Plaintiff's property has already been damaged by defendants' arbitrary and capricious actions, and will be further depreciated in value, in violation of plaintiff's constitutional rights, if Guilford County continues to enforce the zoning regulations as to plaintiff's property; and that plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff prays &quot;(a) permanent injunction restraining defendants and all personnel under&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  their control from enforcing the Zoning Ordinance as to plaintiff's property herein described.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants filed a joint demurrer, asserting therein the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court entered an order sustaining said demurrer.  Plaintiff excepted and appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff property owner challenged a judgment of the Guilford County Superior Court, Greensboro Division (North Carolina), which granted a demurrer filed by defendants, Guilford County, the Inspections Director, and the Planning Director, in an action seeking a permanent injunction restraining defendants and all personnel under their control from enforcing a Zoning Ordinance as to the owner's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The owner held title to a tract of land that was near an airport operated by the Airport Authority. Aircraft using a runway passed directly over the owner's home, so the owner moved his family from the property. The owner submitted an application to the county for an electrical permit in order to use a cinder block building on the property as a shop. The county denied the request because zoning restrictions only allowed residences. The owner filed an application to rezone his property, but the Planning Board denied the application. The owner appealed to the Board of County Commissioners, which denied the request for rezoning, but the owner never applied to the board of adjustment for relief. N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 153-266.17 authorized a homeowner to appeal to the board of adjustment. The court held that the owner could not institute and maintain an action in the superior court to enjoin the county from enforcement of the zoning regulations to his property because the procedure prescribed by statute gave the owner an adequate remedy at law. Therefore, the trial court properly granted the demurrer to the complaint.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An indictment in proper form charging the defendant with murder was returned &quot;a true bill&quot; by the grand jury.  Upon motion of the defendant, the court entered its judgment quashing the indictment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ground upon which the motion was made was that the Clerk has regularly and systematically exempted from service upon the grand jury and the petit jury those persons who applied to him for such exemption and who were declared entitled to such exemption by the following sections of the General Statutes of North Carolina: G.S. 9-19, 90-45, 90-150, and 127-84; prior to the selection of the grand jury which returned this bill of indictment, the Clerk exempted from service, pursuant to such statutes, prospective grand jurors who were qualified to serve as such within the meaning of the Constitution of North Carolina, Article I, &sect; 13; similarly qualified persons have been so exempted by the Clerk from service upon each petit jury called to serve at a criminal session of the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County since the return of the indictment against the defendant by the grand&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  jury; and the said statutes granting such exemption are in violation of the Constitution of North Carolina, Article I, &sect;&sect; 7 and 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The motion to quash was heard upon a stipulation of facts, which may be summarized as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At all times pertinent to this appeal, the selection of the names of persons to serve as jurors in the criminal courts of Mecklenburg County has been made in accordance with the procedure prescribed in the General Statutes.  The Clerk has regularly and systematically exempted from jury duty those persons who have applied therefor to him and who qualify for such exemption under one or more of the above statutes.  Members of the grand jury are selected from a list of names of persons called to serve on criminal jury duty after the names of persons so excused by the Clerk have been removed.  Nine members of the grand jury, which returned the indictment against this defendant, were drawn from the list of jurors for the 3 January 1966 criminal session and nine were drawn from the list for the 4 April criminal session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twelve persons whose names were originally on the list for the 3 January session were found to be exempt and their names were removed before the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  grand jury which indicted the defendant was chosen.  Of these, nine were so exempted on the ground that they were mothers of children under the age of 12 years, one because she was needed to care for her sick husband, one because he was a city fireman, and one because he was a druggist.  Seventeen persons were so exempted and excluded from the list for the 4 April session.  Of these, 12 were so exempted because they were mothers of children under the age of 12 years, one because he was a city fireman, two because they were registered nurses, one because he was a doctor, and one because she was a minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The indictment against this defendant was returnable at the 6 June 1966 session.  A total of 63 persons were so exempted from the list of jurors at that session and subsequent sessions, to and including the session of 5 September 1966.  Of these, 45 were exempted because they were mothers with children under the age of 12 years, five because they were registered nurses, one because he was an attorney at law, one because he was a railroad conductor, one because he was a printer, two because they were doctors, one because he was a railroad engineer, one because he was a linotype operator, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  two because they were volunteer firemen, one because he was a minister, one because he was a member of the North Carolina Air National Guard, one because he was a train dispatcher, and one because he was a city fireman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In support of the motion, William L. Stagg, attorney for the defendant, filed his affidavit, which is not controverted and which we treat as an addition to the stipulated facts.  According to this affidavit, there reside in Mecklenburg County approximately the following numbers of persons who are engaged in occupations whose members are so exempt from jury service by the above statutes:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action for damages for personal injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff alleges that, on December 21, 1959, he entered defendant Hospital as a paying patient for the treatment of an infection; that while he was there, a hospital nurse negligently injected penicillin or some other drug &quot;into or adjacent to the radial nerve&quot; in his left arm; and that the injection resulted in the permanent paralysis and loss of use of the arm and hand.  There is no allegation that defendant failed to use due care in the selection and retention of the nurses who attended him.  Defendant, answering, denies all allegations of negligence and alleges: (1) that it is a nonstock, nonprofit, charitable corporation organized and operated for the treatment of the sick and injured; (2) that it &quot;is and always has been an institution of purely public charity for the purpose of rendering free hospital services to the sick and injured who are financially unable to pay for the same&quot;; (3) that any profits arising from its revenues are put back into the hospital and used&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for the purposes for which it was incorporated; and (4) that as a charitable institution it is exempt by law from liability for injuries resulting from the negligent acts of its employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties agreed that defendant's allegations of charitable immunity should be treated as a plea in bar and determined by the judge without a jury.  Judge Campbell heard the matter upon stipulations which included, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the following: (1) Patients are charged for services rendered on the basis of fixed schedules.  (2) When bills are not paid the hospital undertakes to collect from patients, but it never undertakes to secure collections from an indigent person other than through charitable sources.  (3) The hospital accepts indigent cases &quot;indefinite in number and to the extent of available space&quot; regardless of ability to pay -- no one needing emergency treatment is denied hospitalization.  (4) During the year 1959, defendant's scheduled charges for services rendered indigent patients certified by the Rowan County Welfare Department totaled $ 46,162.52, of which Rowan County paid only $ 32,505.48, the hospital absorbing the balance.  Costs of services rendered to indigents who were not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  certified by the Welfare Department were borne by the hospital.  (5) All funds received by the hospital from any source have at all times been used only to care for the sick and injured, including indigent persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the stipulations, Judge Campbell found that Rowan Memorial Hospital has always been operated as &quot;a nonprofit, community, voluntary hospital&quot;; that in the year of plaintiff's alleged injury (1959), defendant had income in excess of expenses; that the major share of its operating funds is derived from charges made for the care and treatment of paying patients; that no part of defendant Hospital's income in excess of expenses has ever been diverted to private gain, but all such funds are put back into the Hospital's resources.  From these facts the court concluded that, &quot;under and by authority of the case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Williams v.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff injured party sought review of the judgment of the trial court (North Carolina), dismissing his action for negligence for personal injury against defendant hospital, based on the finding that hospital was a charitable organization that had immunity from liability for injuries to patients from the negligence of its employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">On review, the court held that the rule of charitable immunity from liability for the negligent acts of servants was an exception to the general principle of liability that could no longer properly be applied to hospitals, thereby overruling Williams v. Randolph Hospital Inc., 237 N.C. 387, 75 S.E.2d 303 (1953) and Williams v. Union County Hospital Ass'n, 234 N.C. 536, 67 S.E.2d 662 (1951). The trial court's finding that hospital was a charitable institution was not supported by the facts, inasmuch as paying patients provided the major share of hospital's operating funds and large payments were made by governmental agencies on behalf of charity patients. The court found that hospital was liable for the negligence of its employees acting within the scope and course of their employment just as was any other corporate employer. Because hospitals had relied upon the old rule of immunity and may not have adequately protected themselves with liability insurance, the rule of liability applied only to this case and to those causes of action arising after January 20, 1967, the filing date of the opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendants from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Riddle, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, April 1966 Special Criminal Session of Mecklenburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action by plaintiff, a corporation engaged in the restaurant business, in behalf of itself and seventeen other restaurants operating in Mecklenburg County, to enjoin the City of Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board of the State of North Carolina, and the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board of Mecklenburg County from enforcing the Turlington Act as amended by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act of 1937 (ABC Act).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except as quoted, the allegations of plaintiffs' complaint and amended complaint are summarized as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mecklenburg County has elected to come under the ABC Act.  The Attorney General, on March 31, 1966, advised the judge of the Recorder's Court of Charlotte that neither the Turlington Act nor the ABC Act permits one to possess strong alcoholic beverages at any place within &quot;a wet territory&quot; other than in one's dwelling as provided in G.S. 18-11 &quot;and while being transported to one's dwelling as provided by law.&quot; Defendants have announced their intention to begin the immediate enforcement of the ABC Act in accordance with this interpretation, which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is an erroneous one and contrary to the interpretation which defendants have given the law for a period of nineteen years or more.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;That since the passage of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act of 1937 it has become common practice in the City of Charlotte, County of Mecklenburg, and the State of North Carolina to condone, permit, sanction, encourage, and allow persons to take intoxicating liquor into public places, such as owned by the plaintiffs to wit: restaurants, night clubs, country clubs, Veterans' clubs, Elks Clubs, and others, and consume same provided that same was not openly displayed on the table and provided same was in a 'brown (or other color) bag', brief case, pocket, or other means of obscuring same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;That for a period of 19 years or more, the laws have been enforced in this County by the defendants pursuant to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act.  That these plaintiffs commend the defendants for their successful enforcement of said act; even though the defendants have required that the plaintiffs' customers conceal their tax-paid alcoholic beverages in 'Brown bags' underneath their tables at restaurants, night clubs, bottle clubs, country clubs, etc., much to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  inconvenience of these plaintiffs as citizens and their customers.  . . . (T)he plaintiffs being law abiding citizens have complied or attempted to comply with the defendants' request, require their customers to keep the bottles in 'brown bags' or otherwise concealed and under the table of the said customer.  On this point the defendant must admit that the plaintiffs have been overly cooperative.  . . . (S)uch successful enforcement of the laws by the defendants and such wonderful cooperation by the plaintiffs allowed our community to prosper.  . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The enforcement contemplated by defendants would be an interference with plaintiffs' individual liberty and would deprive them of their rights under Sections 1 and 17 of Article I of the North Carolina Constitution to earn a livelihood for that it would either force plaintiffs out of business or cause them to lose &quot;considerable business.&quot; Plaintiffs and others similarly situated have no adequate remedy at law for that actions at law would subject them to (1) inconveniences, fines and penalties; (2) criminal actions; (3) the loss of their beer and wine licenses; and (4) the necessity to &quot;police&quot; their patrons.  Plaintiffs pray both&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a temporary and a permanent injunction prohibiting defendants from enforcing the law according to their announced intentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 7, 1966, Judge Riddle signed an order directing defendants to show cause on April 18, 1966, why the temporary injunction requested by plaintiffs should not be granted.  At the appointed time, the matter came on for hearing.  Two restaurateurs, testifying for plaintiffs, said that since defendants had announced the new policy, their businesses had declined $ 2,000.00 a week; that 90% of their patrons &quot;used setups and consumed alcoholic beverages other than beer and wine while at the restaurants.&quot; A third said that his business had declined 15% to 20% with a resulting loss of $ 300.00 to $ 400.00 a week.  Each proprietor said that his restaurant had a beer license; that he allowed customers to bring tax-paid whiskey in bags onto his premises for consumption before or during their meal; and that it would be impossible to prevent the practice unless patrons were &quot;harassed, frisked, or searched&quot; and unless the restaurant had &quot;a force of ten to every ten tables.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the foregoing testimony, the verified complaint was introduced as an affidavit. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The court also permitted, over defendants' objection, the affidavit of Frank Snepp, Esquire, a Charlotte attorney and a member of the North Carolina General Assembly during its 1959 regular session.  Mr. Snepp averred that the purpose of Section 2 of Chapter 745 of the 1959 Session Laws, which chapter amended General Statutes &sect; 18-78.1(5), was &quot;to allow the holders of beer and wine permits to permit patrons to enter on their premises with tax-paid whiskey and to possess and consume it there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of plaintiffs' evidence, defendants moved that the action be dismissed for a lack of equity.  The judge denied the motion and entered an order in which he found, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, (a) that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated have and will suffer severe and irreparable economic loss, injury and hardship by the enforcement of the law as enunciated by the State Alcoholic Beverage Control Board and the Attorney General's opinion of March 31, 1966; (b) the plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law and &quot;equitable relief is the only real relief which is available to them.&quot; The judge concluded as a matter of law that, in the so-called conforming, or wet, jurisdictions:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(A) judicial interpretation of the Turlington Act as modified by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act of 1937, as amended from time to time, (a) does not prohibit the possession of tax-paid alcoholic beverages not in the purchaser's homes or being transported by the purchaser as permitted by law, and not being displayed at athletic contests or places similar to athletic contests; and, (b) that there is no violation of the criminal laws of the State of North Carolina when members of bona fide private clubs maintain on their private premises, in individual private lockers, small quantities of alcoholic beverages, for their sole use, from time to time, for such persons on said private premises, so long as (1) such member lawfully acquired the alcoholic beverage in question; (2) such member had the sole control over the private locker and its contents; and (3) the said alcoholic beverages were kept for the sole use of the member and not for the sale, exchange, distribution or division among the members of the club or other persons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to the foregoing findings and conclusions, Judge Riddle, &quot;in his equitable jurisdictions,&quot; restrained defendants, pending further orders of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  court, from<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;arresting, charging, or in any manner interfering with plaintiffs or any person in Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, or in any other wet or conforming area that has elected to come under the provisions of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act of 1937 (G.S. 18-36&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c43">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">), for the consumption, display or possession for his own personal use of tax-paid alcoholic beverages, except insofar as such consumption, display or possession for his own personal use is expressly prohibited by the provisions of the said Alcoholic Beverage Control Act of 1937, including the prohibitions contained in G.S. 18-47 and G.S. 18-51.  . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">In the action for equitable relief, defendants, city and county alcoholic beverage commission officials, appealed from the decision of the Special Criminal Session of Mecklenburg (North Carolina), which prevented them from enforcing the Turlington Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 18-1 through 18-30, and the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act of 1937 (ABC Act), N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 18-36 through 18-62, as to plaintiff restaurant owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The restaurant owners sought an injunction on the basis that enforcement of the alcoholic beverage laws by the city and county officials would interfere with individual liberty and would deprive them of the right under N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, 17 to earn a livelihood. They claimed they would lose considerable business if the alcoholic beverage law was enforced, and they had no adequate remedy at law. The trial court denied a motion to dismiss the action for lack of equity, and it found that enforcement of the disputed law would result in severe and irreparable economic loss, injury, and hardship warranting equitable relief. On appeal, the court reversed, noting that the restaurant owners did not question the validity of the Turlington Act or the ABC Act, but only the interpretation of the law. The court held it was a fundamental rule that equity would not interfere to prevent the enforcement of the criminal law, and the constitutional right to earn a livelihood was not infringed by either the Turlington Act or the ABC Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court reversed the order preventing city and county alcoholic beverage officials from applying the alcoholic beverage restrictions on the restaurant owners.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Falls, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, February 7, 1966 Session of Buncombe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the February 1965 Session, in cases numbered 65-99, 65-100, and 65-100A, defendant was indicted in three separate bills, each charging him with forging and uttering a specific check.  When these cases were called for trial at the April 1965 Session before Campbell, J., defendant, through his court-appointed counsel, Melvin K. Elias, entered a plea of guilty to the charges contained in each indictment.  The cases were consolidated for judgment and defendant was sentenced to a term of 18-24 months in the State's Prison.  Thereafter, without advising Mr. Elias of his intentions, defendant, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">in propria persona</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, filed a paper writing which he labeled &quot;Petition for Issuance of Writ of Review in Forma Pauperis Under N. C. General Statutes 15-217 through 15-222.&quot; This petition was mainly a collection of the assorted phrases which have become a part of prison vernacular -- and which the inmates hope will have the magical effect of open sesame -- but it also contained an allegation that defendant first saw his attorney, Mr. Elias, at the time his case was called for trial.  Defendant's prayer for relief was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that he be given an opportunity to prove that &quot;his trial was both unfair and unconstitutional.&quot; He did not specifically request either that he be granted a new trial or that he be released from imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 27, 1965, Martin, J., &quot;after considering said petition and the record in this case,&quot; found that defendant's plea of guilty was voluntarily made with full knowledge of its possible consequences, and dismissed his petition.  Defendant was not present and was not represented by counsel at the time the judge considered and dismissed his petition.  Almost immediately thereafter, defendant wrote out a &quot;Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus&quot; in which he alleged that the indictments upon which he had been tried were illegal because they (1) were not numbered, (2) failed to cite the section number of the statute he was alleged to have violated, and (3) failed to allege &quot;any facts or circumstances concerning any statutes of law.&quot; His prayer for relief was that he be released from &quot;illegal imprisonment.&quot; This petition also came on to be heard before Judge Martin, who reappointed Mr. Elias to represent defendant.  Judge Martin treated the second petition as also having been filed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under G.S. 15-217&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On October 29, 1965, Judge Martin vacated the judgment that defendant be imprisoned for 18-24 months and ordered a new trial in each of the three cases upon the ground that defendant had not had the timely assistance of counsel at the preliminary hearing before the magistrate -- an averment not contained in the petition for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">habeas corpus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  Within the time permitted by G.S. 15-222, defendant, again </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">in propria persona</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, petitioned this Court for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to review the order of October 29, 1965.  He alleged that the judge erred (1) in not ordering his release upon the grounds set out in the petition and (2) in ordering a new trial when he sought only his discharge from imprisonment.  On November 9, 1965, we denied </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 8, 1966, the solicitor put defendant on trial again in Case No. 65-100.  Before the jury was impaneled, defendant objected to a retrial on the ground (1) that he had never requested a retrial but, on the contrary, had objected to the order directing a new trial and had attempted to appeal from it; and (2) that a retrial would violate his constitutional right not to be twice put in jeopardy for the same offense. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He entered a formal plea of former jeopardy, which the court overruled.  Defendant excepted, and the trial proceeded upon his plea of not guilty.  The State offered evidence; defendant offered none.  The verdict was guilty of uttering a forged instrument and not guilty of forgery.  From the judgment that he be confined in the State's Prison for not less than three nor more than five years, defendant appeals.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant pleaded guilty to and was sentenced to 18 to 24 months' imprisonment for forging and uttering three checks. He sought release from imprisonment in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. A new trial was ordered. Defendant appealed from the resulting judgment of the Buncombe County Superior Court (North Carolina), which overruled his plea of former jeopardy, found him guilty, and sentenced him to three to five years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">After being sentenced to 18 to 24 months pursuant to his guilty plea to the forgery charges, defendant filed an initial petition for relief based on his contention that he did not have time to confer with counsel before entering a plea. That petition was dismissed. His subsequent petition for a writ of habeas corpus sought release from imprisonment, but a new trial was ordered instead. His petition for a writ of certiorari to review that decision was denied; after a second trial, defendant received a longer sentence. In vacating that judgment, the court reasoned that a new trial was not granted at defendant's request but was ordered over his protest. In denying his earlier petition for a writ of certiorari, the court inadvertently overlooked his contention that it was error to order a new trial over his protest. Defendant did not seek a new trial and did not waive the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy under N.C. Const. art I, &sect; 17. Therefore, the superior court had no authority to vacate the sentence of 18 to 24 months and to order a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court vacated the judgment and remanded the matter to the superior court with instructions to reinstate the sentence of 18-24 months for defendant to complete the unserved portion of it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff is the owner of a house and lot at 1449 S. Church Street, in the city of Charlotte.  In his complaint he describes it as a one-story frame duplex house, with electricity, two bathrooms, connected to City sewer system, with hot and cold running water and gas heat.  He claims it was re-roofed in 1960, and was at all times maintained up to the existing standards for housing and repaired as authorized by building permits issued by the defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Needless to say, as appears in the complaint, the City does not accept the above as an accurate description, but describes it as in a &quot;dangerous condition * * * open and unoccupied * * * dangerous to the health or lives of the general public and persons passing near or living in the vicinity * * * (it) presents a hazard to children who may play in and around it and endangers the security of adjoining property by being open to vagrants.&quot; It is in an area which has been set aside for redevelopment, and on 12 April, 1963, the building inspector of the City of Charlotte notified the plaintiff that the house was in a dangerous&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  condition that required correction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 24 March, 1964, the defendants notified the plaintiff that since the house was dangerous to the health or lives of the general public, and represented a hazard to children, and that nothing had been accomplished toward correcting the dangerous defects and to render the building safe, it was declared unsafe and condemned and the plaintiff was ordered to remove it within 30 days from the date of that letter.  Having failed to comply with the orders of the city, the defendant Jamison swore out a warrant against the plaintiff on 23 June, 1964, charging him with wilfully violating Sec. 5-4(c) of the Code of the City of Charlotte by renovating and repairing his residence located at 1449 S. Church Street without first making application and obtaining a written permit therefor from the building inspection department of the city.  He was convicted on this charge in the City Recorder's court, appealed to the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County, where he was again convicted, and from a 30-day sentence suspended upon certain conditions, he appealed to this Court.  No error was found and the opinion was recorded in 265 N.C. at page 482. The plaintiff further&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appealed from that decision to the Supreme Court of the United States, where the matter is now pending as far as the record discloses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 23 July, 1964, the plaintiff instituted an action similar to this and against the same parties, in which he sought to have ordinances of the city of Charlotte which provide against alteration or repairs of structures without first obtaining a written permit from the inspection department declared unconstitutional, and for a perpetual injunction against the city to enforce said ordinances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Clark of the Superior Court restrained the city from demolishing the building until the final determination of the action but refused to issue a temporary restraining order against the enforcement of the provisions of the building code.  The plaintiff appealed from that decision, which was affirmed by this Court at the Fall Term, 1964.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Walker v. City of Charlotte</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 262 N.C. 697, 138 S.E. 2d 501. That litigation was later terminated -- this record shows no more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The present action was instituted by the plaintiff against the City of Charlotte on 19 November, 1965, in which he seeks to have the Court declare (1) that those parts of the Charlotte City Charter&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  referred to above are void and unconstitutional and in conflict with and an abridgement of his rights under the North Carolina Constitution and of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U. S. Constitution; (2) that G.S. 160-151 referred to in his complaint should be declared unconstitutional; (3) that the Court declare portions of the building code of the City of Charlotte unconstitutional; (4) that the Order of 24 March, 1964, directing him to remove his residence be declared void and of no legal effect; (5) that a perpetual injunction issue enjoining and restraining the defendants from enforcing the provisions referred to above.  The City demurred to the plaintiff's complaint on the grounds that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action in that the plaintiff has completely failed to show such circumstances as to warrant the exercise by equity of its injunctive power, and in that it is manifest that a court of law in a criminal prosecution can and will afford an adequate legal remedy to test the constitutionality of the State statutes and municipal ordinances challenged in the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the hearing, Judge Jackson held that the complaint does not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for the reasons sought, sustained the demurrer and dismissed the action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff property owner sought review of a decision of the Mecklenburg County Superior Court (North Carolina), which sustained the demurrer of defendants, a city and its superintendent of building inspection, and dismissed his action to have a statute and certain portions of the city's building code declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The owner's property was condemned due to unsafe conditions. When the owner failed to comply with the orders of the city to remove the unsafe building, the superintendent swore out a warrant against him charging him with wilfully violating a city ordinance. The court ruled that the trial court erred in sustaining defendants' demurrer because a demurrer did not lie in a case brought under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-253-267, the Declaratory Judgment Act, where a justiciable controversy was alleged. The test of the sufficiency of the owner's complaint was not whether the complaint showed that he was entitled to the declaration of rights in accordance with his theory, but whether he was entitled to a declaration of rights at all. Thus, even if the owner was on the wrong side of the controversy, because he stated the existence of a controversy that should have been settled, he stated a cause of suit for a declaratory judgment. Because his complaint in a proceeding for a declaratory judgment stated a justiciable controversy, defendants' demurrer should have been overruled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court found error in the trial court's decision and remanded the case. Defendants were allowed 30 days from the filing of the opinion in which to answer the complaint. The trial court was directed thereupon to adjudicate the questions presented by appropriate decree.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1933 the Legislature enacted several statutes which authorized the leasing of oyster beds by the Board of Conservation &amp; Development to citizens of the State.  Those pertaining to this action were G.S. 113-176, 181, 182, 183 and 184.  They provided in substance that the Board should have power to lease to any citizen of the State &quot;any bottom of the waters of the State not a natural oyster bed&quot; for 20 years, the rental to be at the rate of 50 cents per acre per year for the first 10 years, and one dollar per acre per year for the next 10 years of the lease, payable annually.  The leases were to be heritable and transferable and were to be for a period of 20 years.  At the expiration of the first lease the lessee was entitled to successive leases on the same terms as applied to the last 10 years of the first lease, for a period not exceeding 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 20 January, 1953, the plaintiff Earl Oglesby leased a 10-acre section of the bottom of Newport River, Carteret County, for a 20-year period, with the right of renewal referred to in the statute.  The plaintiff complied with his responsibilities&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under the lease, paying the lease price each year and cultivating the river bottom in appropriate manner.  Prior to April 1st, 1965, he offered the sum of $ 10 as rental for the succeeding year.  This was declined by the State under the authority of legislation enacted by the 1965 General Assembly which amended part of the statutes referred to above and added other provisions, among which was one that anyone who deemed himself damaged may apply to the Industrial Commission for the award of such damages as he may prove.  The 1965 act permitted a charge of five dollars per acre per year for the lands in question, and the Board required payment of that amount, or a total of $ 50 instead of the $ 10 tendered.  Plaintiff refused to pay the larger amount and brought this action to obtain a declaratory judgment to the effect that the 1965 act was unconstitutional in that it impaired his contractual rights and also sought an injunction to prevent the Board from cancelling his lease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Superior Court upheld his position, declared the act unconstitutional as it relates to the plaintiff, and required the Board to &quot;comply and abide by said lease to the same extent as if the 1965 legislation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had not been enacted.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 113-176, -181, -182, -183, and -184 (1933) allowed the Board of Conservation &amp; Development to lease oyster beds for a specific amount, with the leases renewable for 20 years. In 1965, the provisions were amended to increase the rental rate, and the lessee refused to pay the increased rate. The trial court found that the amendment impaired the lessee's contractual rights and enjoined the Board from cancelling his lease. On appeal, the court found that the trial court properly found the amendment to be an unconstitutional impairment of contract rights. Although an individual had no vested right in a continuance of statutory law, the lessee was relying upon a contract duly and legally executed by the State, and the State was not at liberty to violate that contract by subsequent legislation. The State had made an absolute grant for a period of 20 years, and that grant could not be defeated. The lessee was entitled to the successive leases on the same terms as originally provided.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal prosecutions on warrants, tried </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the superior court after appeal by defendants from convictions and judgments of the Gates County Recorder's Court.  Each of the three appellants was charged in a separate warrant.  The three cases were consolidated for trial, judgment and appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One warrant charges that Vaughan, on or about December 18, 1965, &quot;did unlawfully and willfully hunt deer by aid of an artificial light after sunset and before sunrise with the aid of an artificial light on a highway, G.S. 113-104, G.S. 113-109, against the form of the Statute,&quot; etc.  In the warrants as to Catena and Smith, &quot;G.S. 113-109&quot; is omitted; otherwise, these warrants contain allegations identical to those in the Vaughan warrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants having pleaded not guilty, a jury was selected, sworn and empaneled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State offered evidence which, in brief summary, tends to show: The car occupied by the three defendants entered North Carolina from Virginia and parked on the highway next to a rye grain field.  Someone in the car raked the field at least twice with a strong light that threw a beam more&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  than fifty feet.  A loaded rifle and several hunting knives were in the car.  A quilt and deer hair were in the trunk (boot) of the car.  The incident occurred shortly after midnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the State's evidence, defendants moved for judgment as in case of nonsuit.  The record shows: &quot;The Court ruled that the State proved a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">prima facie</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case pursuant to G.S. 113-109(b), but holds that said Section establishes a standard for a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">prima facie</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case that is so vague as to render it unconstitutional.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State excepted &quot;(t)o the entry of the foregoing judgment in each case,&quot; and gave notice of appeal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The State appealed from judgments entered by the Criminal Session of Gates County Superior Court (North Carolina) granting nonsuits to defendants on charges that they violated N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 113-109(b) on the grounds that part of the statute defining the offense established a standard for a prima facie case that was so vague as to render it unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendants were charged under a law that outlawed certain deer hunting methods. A de novo trial in the superior court, held after defendants appealed from convictions by a recorder's court, resulted in judgments granting defense motions for nonsuit on the grounds that the portion of the statute that established a standard for a prima facie case was so vague as to render it unconstitutional. The State appealed, but the court granted defense motions to dismiss. In so ruling, the court noted that the sufficiency of the State's evidence on the offense itself was not at issue. Rather, the question was whether the State was entitled to appeal. Relying on N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-179, which delineated the six specific situations in which the State was entitled to appeal and was required to be strictly construed against an appeal, the court found that it was not so entitled. This was because the superior court found in favor of defendants on the issue of their guilt. Moreover, a 1945 amendment to &sect; 15-179 did not authorize an appeal from a judgment of a nonsuit even if such judgment was based in part on a ruling that a statute purporting to create a rule of evidence was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiffs from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Gambill, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, January 1966 Civil Session of Moore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs are citizens and taxpayers of Moore County, and residents of the Southern Pines School Administrative Unit and the Pinehurst School Administrative Unit, respectively.  They brought this suit for a determination that Chapter 1051 of the Session Laws of 1965 is unconstitutional and void, and for the issuance of an injunction enjoining the defendants from proceeding with the holding of an election pursuant to such Act and from doing or performing any other act or thing pursuant thereto.  They sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the holding of the election provided for under the Act, but this was denied and the election was held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, the matter came on for final hearing before the judge, without a jury, it being stipulated that the court might find the facts, enter its conclusions of law, and render judgment upon the basis of the pleadings and the stipulations of the parties.  Upon such hearing, the court below entered its judgment, reciting findings of fact and conclusions of law.  It adjudged the Act constitutional, ruled that the members of the Moore County Board of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Education, appointed pursuant to the Act, were duly appointed, qualified and acting, denied the injunctive relief prayed for and ordered the action retired from the civil issue docket, the plaintiffs to pay the cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From this judgment the plaintiffs appeal, assigning a large number of alleged errors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Act in question was adopted by the General Assembly on 14 June 1965.  At that time, the county was divided into three School Administrative Units -- Southern Pines, Pinehurst, and the Moore County Administrative Unit, the last including all of the county except the areas within the two city units.  For many years prior to 1 April 1965, the Moore County School Administrative Unit included thirteen school attendance districts, nine with reference to the schools attended by white children and four with reference to schools attended by Negro children, the four overlapping and including all the area included in the nine.  These school attendance districts had been created by the State Board of Education, from time to time, at the request of the then Moore County Board of Education.  On 1 April 1965, acting upon the petition of the then Moore County Board of Education, the State Board&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Education abolished all county school districts previously established in the Moore County School Administrative Unit, so that on and after 1 April 1965, there was only one school attendance district in the Moore County Administrative Unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the passage of the Act in question, a valid school supplement tax was levied and collected upon property within the Southern Pines School Administrative Unit, pursuant to the vote of the people therein in elections held in prior years.  Similarly, a valid school supplement tax was in effect, levied and collected upon property in the Pinehurst School Administrative Unit.  School supplement taxes were also then in effect, levied and collected upon property in the Aberdeen School District and in the West End School District, these districts being within the Moore County School Administrative Unit.  There was no school supplement tax in effect in any other district of that unit.  The rates of these school supplement taxes varied as between the several units or districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On or about 23 August 1963, bonds were issued, pursuant to a bond order adopted by the County Board of Commissioners, in the total amount of Three Million Dollars, for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the erection in each of the three administrative units of various new school buildings and additions to and improvements of existing school buildings.  The bond order provided that, of the total, $ 2,195,700 &quot;shall be used to finance the cost of erecting such new buildings or reconstructing or enlarging such existing buildings in the Moore County School Administrative Unit or to finance the cost of acquiring lands or furnishings or equipment necessary for such purposes,&quot; $ 249,600 &quot;shall be used&quot; for such purposes in the Pinehurst City School Administrative Unit, and $ 554,700 &quot;shall be used&quot; for such purposes in the Southern Pines City School Administrative Unit.  The order also provided for the annual levy and collecting of a tax sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on such bonds.  The order was to take effect when approved by the voters of the county at an election, which was held and at which the bond issue was approved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1943 the General Assembly adopted &quot;an Act creating five districts for the nomination of members of the Board of Education of Moore County.&quot; Chapter 76 of the Session Laws of 1943.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A summary of the Act of 1965, Chapter 1051 of the Session Laws of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1965, the object of the plaintiffs' attack, is set forth in the opinion.  In brief, that Act provided for the holding of an election in Moore County to determine (1) whether the Southern Pines, Pinehurst and Moore County School Administrative Units should be merged, and (2) whether the Board of Commissioners of Moore County should be authorized to levy a county-wide school supplement tax not to exceed the annual rate of thirty cents per one hundred dollars of assessed property valuation.  The election was held.  The merger was approved by a majority vote.  The tax was rejected by a majority vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereupon, the Board of Commissioners of the County appointed a new Moore County Board of Education, consisting of seven members, one from each of the five districts referred to in the 1943 Statute, including a member of the Board for the County Administrative Unit, and two at large, one of these, at the time of appointment to the new County Board of Education, being a member of the Board of Education for the Pinehurst Administrative Unit and the other being a member of the Board of Education for the Southern Pines Administrative Unit.  These seven members thereupon took their oaths of office&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as members of the Moore County Board of Education.  This seven member Board thereupon elected its chairman from its membership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Moore County Administrative Unit has $ 717,000, remaining from its share of the proceeds of the 1963 bond issue, plus $ 613,000, allotted to it from State funds, making a total of $ 1,330,000 now in its hands available for school building construction.  Within the past two years it constructed two high schools in the northern part of the county, each adequate to accommodate 900 students, and each costing approximately $ 1,300,000.  The Pinehurst and Southern Pines Administrative Units have substantial funds remaining from their respective shares of the bond issue and of the allotment of State funds.  The funds so available to the Moore County Administrative Unit would be sufficient to construct a high school building, adequate to accommodate all high school pupils residing within the area of that unit and not presently accommodated at the other two new high school buildings and those funds, plus the funds so remaining in the hands of the Pinehurst and Southern Pines Units, would be sufficient to construct a consolidated high school building, adequate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to take care of the high school pupils from those units as well, according to the evidence offered by the defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The substance of the plaintiffs' complaint is that, Chapter 1051, Session Laws of 1965, is &quot;invalid, unconstitutional, and void&quot; because: (1) Its provisions for the appointment and election of the members of the new County Board of Education are vague and meaningless so that they cannot be carried into effect; (2) the residents of the Pinehurst and Southern Pines Administrative Units are not afforded representation on the new Board comparable to that afforded the residents of the area of the Moore County School Administrative Unit; (3) the Act provides authority in the Board to condemn a site for a new high school extending to a total of 75 acres, which is contrary to the general law contained in G.S. 115-125; (4) the provisions of the Act for the continuation of school supplement taxes, heretofore authorized, constitute an unlawful, unequal and unconstitutional taxation of the residents of the areas in which such taxes were previously adopted; (5) the Act violates Article II, Section 29, of the North Carolina Constitution in that it is a special or local act establishing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a school district or changing the lines thereof; (6) the provision requiring that one member of the Board of Education of each of the existing administrative units be a member of the new County Board of Education violates the provisions of Article XIV, Section 7, of the North Carolina Constitution relating to dual office holding; and (7) the newly constituted County Board of Education does not have sufficient funds to build an adequate consolidated high school as directed in the Act and intends, unlawfully, to use proceeds of the 1963 bond issue for such purpose.  The answer alleges that the defendants have available sufficient funds for the implementation of all provisions of the 1965 Act with reference to the construction of schools.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff taxpayers appealed the judgment of the trial court (North Carolina), which denied injunctive relief and held that members of the county board of education were duly elected under the 1965 Act, Chapter 1051 of the Session Laws of 1965.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The taxpayers contended that the 1965 Act, Chapter 1051 of the Session Laws of 1965 (Act), was unconstitutional because it was too loosely and obscurely drawn as to be incapable of enforcement. The taxpayers sought to have the entire Act declared invalid. Pursuant to the Act, the county board of education held an election. The county board of education sought to levy school supplement taxes and to issue bonds for the construction of new school buildings and expenses. The court disagreed with the taxpayers that the county school board exceeded its authority under the Act and held that the Act's meaning could be ascertained from its own terms when read in the light of existing statutes that were considered by the legislature. Where the general scope and purpose of a statute was constitutional, the entire statute would not be declared void because some minor provisions were ambiguous and unconstitutional. Rather, the unconstitutional portions could be stricken out. Thus, the court held that the Act was not void on the ground of vagueness and uncertainty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court affirmed that the county school board's members were duly elected and served under the authority of the Act. All of the taxpayers' other assignments of error regarding the admissibility of evidence were without merit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs, as citizens and taxpayers of Beaufort County, brought this action on April 22, 1966, (1) to restrain defendant Beaufort County Board of Education (School Board), from expending any money of Beaufort County for the purpose of constructing a centrally located building to consolidate and house the student bodies of the John A.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May 1960, defendant School Board and the Board of Education for the Washington City School Administrative Unit jointly requested the Division of School Planning of the State Department of Public Instruction to survey all the schools in Beaufort County and to make long-range recommendations for the improvement of the two school systems.  In consequence, a survey committee was commissioned.  It made its report on October 22, 1962, and, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, recommended that immediate steps be taken to build a consolidated high school on the north side of the Pamlico River, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">i.e.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in District III.  On April 14, 1964, defendant School Board and the Washington City Board passed a joint resolution requesting defendant Commissioners to authorize a bond issue in the amount of $ 1,400,000.00 for school construction, 52.96% to be allotted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the County Administrative Unit and the remaining 47.04% to the Washington City Administrative Unit.  These percentages corresponded to the number of students in the two units.  Pursuant to the request of the two School Boards, at the meeting of defendant Commissioners, on September 8, 1964, a bond order was introduced authorizing the bond issue requested.  At the same meeting defendant Commissioners scheduled a public hearing on the bond issue for September 22, 1964.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 11, 1964, defendant School Board adopted a resolution showing the &quot;allocation of funds for school building projects&quot; which it would make if the Beaufort County bond order and the State bond issue (authorized by Pub. L. 1963, ch. 1079), were approved by the voters.  The proposed allocations were:</SPAN></P>

Defendants, in their brief, concede that the preelection publicity indicated that the allocation of $ 780,000.00 for &quot;Central High School on the north side of the river&quot; was for a consolidated high school which would house only white students from the Pantego, Bath, and Wilkinson high schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the public hearing on September 22, 1964, the allocation of funds made by defendant School Board on September 11th was publicized, explained, and debated.  Following the hearing, defendant Commissioners enacted the bond order authorizing the issuance of school bonds in the amount of $ 1,400,000.00, pursuant to the County Finance Act.  The order stated the objects for which the bonds were to be issued as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Section 1. The Board of Commissioners of the County of Beaufort has ascertained and hereby determines that it is necessary to erect in the Beaufort County Administrative Unit and in the Washington City School Administrative Unit, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  several new buildings to be used as school houses, school garages, physical education and vocational education buildings, lunchrooms and other school plant facilities, and to reconstruct and enlarge, by the erection of additions, several existing buildings located in such Units and used for such purposes, and to acquire land and furnishings and equipment necessary for such new or reconstructed or enlarged buildings, in order to enable the County of Beaufort as an administrative agency of the public school system of the State of North Carolina, to maintain public schools in said school administrative units for the nine months' school term prescribed by law, and that it will be necessary to expend for such purposes not less than $ 1,400,000 in addition to other moneys which have been made available therefor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 3 of the order allotted $ 741,580.00 to the Beaufort County School Administrative Unit and $ 658,420.00 to the Washington City School Administrative Unit.  Notice of the bond order and the election to be held on November 3, 1964 (the same day as the referendum on the State bond election), were thereafter duly published.  In an effort to secure the voters' approval of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the bonds, prior to November 3rd, defendant School Board &quot;distributed to interested citizens&quot; a mimeographed bulletin containing, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the allocation made by it on September 11, 1964.  The bulletin also contained questions and answers of interest to the taxpayers, one of which was:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Q. If the Bath, John A. Wilkinson, and Pantego High Schools are consolidated, will the present school building facilities and equipment in those schools continue to be used?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">A. Yes.  Each school will remain an elementary school and have grades from one through eight in it.  There will be a principal of each school who can devote his entire leadership and professional talent to the improvement of instruction in the elementary grades.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant School Board likewise caused the publication of sample ballots, and urged the electorate to vote Yes for both the state and county bond issues.  The ballot for the county bond issue was phrased in the same general language of the bond order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the referendum, both state and county bond issues were approved by a better than three-to-one majority of the votes cast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 2, 1964, the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 became law.  Title&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  VI of the Act (78 Stat. 252, 42 U.S.C.A. &sect;&sect; 2000d through 2000d-4) authorizes and directs each Federal agency empowered to extend financial assistance to any program or activity to issue rules, regulations or orders of general application, to the end that no persons &quot;be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance,&quot; on the ground of race, color, or national origin.  Compliance with such rules and regulations &quot;may be effected (1) by the termination of or refusal to grant or to continue assistance under such program . . . or (2) by any other means authorized by law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 20, 1965, defendant School Board, in an official session, adopted a plan for compliance with Title VI of the Act.  The plan contained, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the following:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;District III.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">A central consolidated high school plant will be constructed in the approximate geographic center of this district . . . and all high school children therein will be assigned to this high school for the 1966-67 school year and each year thereafter.  An appropriation has been made for the construction of this high&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  school plant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This plan departed from the pre-referendum allocation of September 11, 1964, in that, instead of consolidating only the three white high schools, it proposed to consolidate all of the five high schools in District III into one central high school for the children of both races.  In an official session on August 24, 1965, the School Board unanimously resolved:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;That the $ 105,000.00 allocated for additional construction at the Beaufort County High School and the $ 90,000.00 allocated to build additional facilities at the Belhaven High School be added to the allocation of the $ 780,000.00 previously planned for the construction for the central consolidated high school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Board of Education, on November 4, 1965, approved defendant School Board's &quot;School Improvement Program,&quot; which included the consolidation of all five high schools in District III.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 5, 1966, defendant School Board, in compliance with G.S. 115-76, conducted a public hearing on the proposal to consolidate the five high schools.  Present at the hearing as a representative of the State Board of Education was Dr. J. L. Pierce, Director of the Division of School Planning. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The next day, the superintendent of the Beaufort County Schools requested the State Board of Education to join the County Board in approving the proposed consolidation.  He was informed by the Assistant Superintendent of the State Department of Public Instruction that the State Board, at its meeting on November 4, 1965, had approved the long-range plan for the consolidation of these high schools as proposed by the Beaufort County Board of Education and recommended by the State Review Panel, and that no further action was necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 9, 1966, defendant School Board enacted and submitted to defendant Commissioners a resolution requesting their approval of the plan to omit the improvements originally intended for the Beaufort County and Belhaven high schools and to use these funds to finance an enlarged Central High School with a capacity of 900 pupils instead of 600.  With reference to this request, the complaint alleges &quot;that the Board of County Commissioners refused to endorse the revision as requested by the defendant Board of Education and took no action whatever on the request.&quot; In his judgment, Judge Mintz found as a fact that defendant Commissioners &quot;in session on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  March 7, 1966, upon the counsel of Mr. L. H. Ross, informed the Board of Education that the bond order for the County School Bond Funds has sufficient latitude to enable the Board of Education to apply the funds to School building construction according to needs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 8, 1966, defendant School Board unanimously adopted a resolution which recited that the original plan to consolidate only the Bath, Wilkinson, and Pantego high schools had to be abandoned when the School Board was required to make a plan for compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; that compliance with the Act required the consolidation of all five high schools in District III, and necessitated the transfer of the funds previously earmarked for Beaufort County High School and Belhaven High School to the Central High School project; that the State Board of Education had approved the building plans for the Central High School; that, at the public hearing on January 5, 1966, &quot;the objections presented were not sufficiently valid to alter or change the plan for the Central High School&quot;; that the office of the Attorney General had advised the School Board that compliance with the Civil Rights Act is necessary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to qualify the Beaufort County School Administrative Unit for the receipt of $ 475,275.66, Beaufort County's share of the State school bond funds; and that defendant Commissioners, upon the advice of the county attorney, had advised the School Board that the bond order gave it sufficient latitude to enable it to apply the funds to school building construction according to needs.  Upon these recitals, the School Board resolved to proceed immediately with the &quot;construction of a central high school on the site already purchased in the Yeatesville area for a high school plant of 900 or more students to replace the Bath High School, Beaufort County High School, Belhaven High School, John A. Wilkinson High School, and Pantego High School.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June 1965, defendant Commissioners borrowed $ 400,000.00 upon bond anticipation notes, and this sum has been expended for &quot;purposes authorized in the bond issue,&quot; including $ 35,000.00 for a site for the construction of Central High School.  Plaintiffs alleged that, in June 1966, defendants plan to borrow $ 500,000 more on bond anticipation notes and, with the money, to begin the construction of a central high school plant to house children from the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  five schools of District III.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the termination of the hearing before him, Judge Mintz found facts which, insofar as they went, are consistent with the above statement.  He concluded as a matter of law that the referendum was in all respects regular and valid, and that the construction of the planned Central High School to replace the five schools is proper and valid.  He entered judgment dissolving the injunction, and plaintiffs appealed.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Reversed and remanded.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff taxpayers appealed from the judgment of the North Carolina trial court, which concluded, as a matter of law, that a referendum passed by defendant county board of commissioners (commissioners), allowing defendant State Board of Education (board) to build a new high school to replace the five schools, was valid and it dissolved a injunction against the expenditure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The taxpayers' first contention, originally valid, became moot when the board complied with the requirements of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115-76(1). The parties stipulated that the board formally approved the consolidation of the five high schools into one central high school by resolution. The taxpayers' second and third contentions required a consideration of the relative duties of county commissioners and county boards of education with reference to the public schools. The court found that the dual responsibility of the county and state entities required great cooperation between them. The court found that the commissioners had not acted upon the board's request that it approve a reallocation of the funds in question and, thus, the board had no authority, acting alone, to make the reallocation. Until the commissioners approved the request, the board could not proceed; therefore, the court reversed the trial court judgment and reinstated the injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The judgment vacating an injunction preventing the board from replacing five schools by building a new high school was reversed and the injunction was reinstated pending a review of the issues on the merits on remand.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State appeals from the allowance by the superior court of the defendant's motions to quash two warrants issued by the Clerk of the Municipal Court of High Point purporting to charge the defendant with violation of City Ordinance 15-24.1 of the city of High Point on 18 March 1965 and 16 March 1965 respectively.  The defendant was tried and found guilty on each charge in the municipal court and, in each case, was sentenced to confinement in the county jail for a period of 30 days, each sentence being suspended for 12 months on condition that he not violate the said ordinance and that he pay a fine of $ 25.00 and costs.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action instituted on 26 October 1964 under the Declaratory Judgment Act, G.S. 1-253&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in which the plaintiffs, citizens and taxpayers of the City of Raleigh, seek to test the validity of an ordinance adopted by the City of Raleigh, which became effective 5 October 1964.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a class action brought by the plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and all other persons having or claiming an interest in the subject matter of the controversy in common with the plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action was originally instituted against the City of Raleigh and the individual members of the City Council of the City of Raleigh, and T. W. Bruton, the Attorney General of North Carolina.  On 2 November 1964 the Southeastern Cablevision Company was made a party-defendant.  The City of Raleigh and the Cablevision Company filed separate answers.  They filed a joint brief in this Court.  The Attorney General filed no formal answer, neither did he file a brief in connection with this appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first section of the ordinance sought to be tested reads as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Section I.  That a person, firm or corporation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  may install and operate Community Antenna Television System in the City of Raleigh under the conditions set out herein and for that purpose is granted:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c31"><SPAN CLASS="c10">(a) The right and the privilege for a period of fifteen (15) years from the effective date of a license issued pursuant to this ordinance to erect structures in the City of Raleigh and to construct, maintain and operate in, over, and along present and future streets, alleys and public places of the City of Raleigh, towers, poles, lines, cables, necessary wiring and other apparatus for the purpose of receiving, amplifying and distributing television, electronic electrical and radio signals, audio and video, to said City and the inhabitants thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c32"><SPAN CLASS="c10">(b) To attach or otherwise affix cables or wires to the pole facilities of any public utility company, even though the same may cross the streets, sidewalks, public lands and highways of the City of Raleigh, provided the said Grantee or assigns secures the permission or consent of said aforementioned public utility company concerned to affix the said cables or wires or other apparatus to their pole facilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 2 of the ordinance provides that the license granted shall&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be subject to the following conditions: (These conditions are set forth in some 25 paragraphs.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 3 of the ordinance relates to the manner in which the application for license should be made, and may require of the applicant &quot;as a condition precedent to the granting of the license that cash or its equivalent in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($ 10,000.00) be deposited with the City guaranteeing the installation of the necessary facilities for the conduct of the business, * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the matter came on for hearing, a jury trial was waived, and the trial judge concluded as a matter of law that the ordinance was a valid and lawful ordinance of the City of Raleigh and the plaintiffs are not entitled to any injunctive relief as prayed for in their complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant citizens challenged a decision of a Wake County trial court (North Carolina), which found that an ordinance passed by appellee city, which authorized the installation and operation of an antenna television system and provided for the licensure of those entities installing and operating the system, was valid and held that the citizens were not entitled to injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The citizens instituted an action under the Declaratory Judgment Act, N.C. Gen.

The trial court found that the ordinance was valid and denied the injunctive relief requested by the citizens. The court vacated the judgment. It found that while the Act enabled courts to take cognizance of disputes at an earlier stage, an action for a declaratory judgment would lie only in a case in which there was an actual or real existing controversy between parties having adverse interests in the matter in dispute. In the instant case, the city had issued no license pursuant to the provisions of the ordinance and nothing had been done in connection with the ordinance that violated any rights of the citizens. Further, the citizens did not allege that they suffered any wrong or financial loss by reason of any action taken by the city in connection with the adoption of the ordinance. Accordingly, no genuine justiciable controversy existed between the parties and the action had to be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action was instituted by First National Bank of Nevada, Executor of the will of Pearl K. Wells, Planters National Bank &amp; Trust Company and Lillian Kent Dickens, Ancillary Administrators of the estate of Pearl K. Wells, to recover from the defendant, a citizen of Durham County, North Carolina, the pro rata part of the federal estate taxes attributable to property received by him by virtue of the exercise of a power of appointment by Pearl K. Wells.  Two companion suits were brought by the same plaintiffs against William M. Wells, Jr. and Alice Elizabeth Wells Romanek.  In each of those suits the allegations of the complaints and the answers were identical to those in this case.  The three cases were consolidated for trial and identical judgments were entered.  For convenience, only one case was appealed and a stipulation was entered to the effect that the decision of the Supreme Court in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Redmond S. Wells</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case would control the other two cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By instrument dated 3 February 1956 William M. Wells, husband of Pearl K. Wells, created a trust for the benefit of his wife.  Planters&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  National Bank &amp; Trust Company of Rocky Mount, North Carolina, was named Trustee in said instrument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer of the defendant, Redmond S. Wells, who is an incompetent by reason of a congenital disease, was duly verified by Josey M. Wells, his general guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William M. Wells died on 6 September 1961.  He left a last will and testament dated 6 February 1956.  In Item 4 of the will the testator devised to the Planters National Bank &amp; Trust Company of Rocky Mount, North Carolina, as Trustee under the trust above referred to, sufficient property which, when added to any other property devised or bequeathed to his wife and qualifying for the marital deduction, would equal one-half of his adjusted gross estate.  He directed that the five farms in North Carolina, described in paragraph 8 of the complaint, be included in the Pearl K. Wells trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Item 7 of the instrument creating the Pearl K. Wells trust by William M. Wells provided that the Pearl K. Wells trust would terminate upon the death of Pearl K. Wells and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">corpus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of the trust would be equally divided between the defendant, Redmond S. Wells, and his brother, William M. Wells, Jr., and his sister, Alice Elizabeth Wells&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Romanek, who were children of William M. Wells by a previous marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Item 9 of the above instrument contained the following provision:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(9) But notwithstanding all the foregoing limitations over after the death of my wife, nevertheless, my said wife, Pearl K. Wells, shall alone and at all events throughout her lifetime have the power to dispose of the entire </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c43">corpus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> of this trust, free of the trust, by her will, but only by making specific reference to this power, as she may see fit, with the same effect as if she were the owner of said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c43">corpus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> free of the trust.  This provision shall override all the limitations after the original life estate to my wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pearl K. Wells died on 28 June 1962.  She left a last will and testament dated 5 May 1961 in which she exercised the power of appointment created by her husband and devised the North Carolina real estate involved herein to the three children of her husband by a previous marriage, share and share alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court below found as a fact that the gross estate of Pearl K.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conclusions of law of the court below pertinent to decision herein are as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;3. That section 2207 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.A. 2207) is applicable to the facts of this case and is valid and constitutional and does not violate the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.  Under said section the plaintiffs are entitled to recover from the defendant 16.66% of the Federal estate tax which they have paid on the Estate of Pearl K. Wells and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  any interest on said tax which they have paid, together with interest at the rate of 6% from the dates of payment; that is, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover 16.66% of each payment shown in Finding of Fact 11 above, together with interest thereon from the date of such payment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;4. In the event that the Court is wrong in Conclusion of Law 3 immediately above, then the Court is of the opinion that North Carolina Law would be applicable to the question of whether the defendant should be required to bear a pro rata part of the Federal estate tax.  The Court is of the opinion that under the North Carolina Law the defendant should bear his pro rata part of the Federal estate tax attributable to the value of the property received by him on account of the exercise of the power of appointment by Pearl K. Wells, and that such apportionment of the Federal estate tax is fair, just and equitable.  Under North Carolina Law the plaintiffs are entitled to recover from the defendant 16.66% of the Federal estate tax which they have paid on the Estate of Pearl K. Wells and any interest on said tax which they have paid, together with interest at the rate of 6% from the dates of payment; that is, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  the plaintiffs are entitled to recover 16.66% of each payment shown in Finding of Fact 11 above, together with interest thereon from the date of such payment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;And it appearing to the Court that the plaintiffs have abandoned the theory that they are entitled to recover of the defendant a pro rata part of the Federal estate tax by virtue of the binding and conclusive effect of the Orders issued by the Second Judicial Court of the State of Nevada, for that said Court lacked jurisdiction of the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;And it further appearing to the Court that under the Finding of Fact above the Nevada 'Federal Estate Tax Apportionment Law' does not apply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;And it further appearing to the Court that under the Findings of Fact above the plaintiffs are entitled to recover on the theories of the case set forth under Conclusions of Law 3 and 4 above.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs and against the defendant for 16.66% of the respective payments made by the executor of the estate of Pearl K.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 14 April 1965, the city of Randleman instituted a special proceeding before the Clerk of the Superior Court of Randolph County for the purpose of acquiring &quot;rights-of-way, privileges or easements for the construction and operation of sewer and/or water lines&quot; across two tracts of land which the city alleges are owned by the defendant in fee simple and which it describes by metes and bounds in its petition.  The proposed rights-of-way or easements are described by metes and bounds in the petition and are located entirely within the right-of-way of North Carolina State Highway No. 2133.  The city seeks permanent easements.  It alleges in its petition that it has been unable to negotiate with the defendant concerning the purchase of such rights-of-way and easements and that the same can not be purchased for a reasonable price.  The petition alleges that the Board of Aldermen of the city has ordered that the said rights-of-way and easements be acquired by condemnation in accordance with the laws of the State.  The prayer of the petition is that commissioners of appraisal be appointed to view the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  premises, &quot;hear the proof and allegations of the parties,&quot; determine the compensation, if any, which ought to be made by the city to the defendant, and report to the court to the end that the said rights-of-way and easements may be condemned for the use of the city upon compensating the defendant as provided by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon application by the defendant, the clerk entered an order extending her time for filing an answer through 14 May 1965.  On that date she filed her answer.  In it she admits the right of the city to acquire by condemnation the easements sought in the petition, but alleges that the city has refused to pay her just compensation therefor.  The prayer of the answer is that the defendant be awarded just compensation for the taking of her land, which she alleges is $ 2.00 per running foot for the total length of the easements sought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, on 28 April 1965, the clerk issued an order appointing commissioners to appraise the property proposed to be taken.  This order directed the commissioners to hold their first meeting in the office of the clerk at 10:00 a.m. on 28 April 1965, the date of their appointment.  It further ordered the commissioners to view the premises, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;hear the proofs and allegations of the parties, if any, and reduce the testimony, if any is taken by them, to writing, and after the testimony is closed, * * * ascertain and determine the compensation which ought justly to be made by the City of Randleman to the party owning or interested in said real estate.&quot; The order further directed the commissioners to report to the court within ten days from the date of the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commissioners filed their report with the clerk on 5 May 1965, this being nine days before the expiration of the time allowed the defendant to answer the petition and before the filing of her answer.  The report states that the commissioners met at 10:00 a.m. on 28 April 1965 in the office of the clerk and, having first been duly sworn, &quot;subsequently visited the premises of the defendant, and after taking into full consideration the quality and quantity of the land involved, and all inconveniences likely to result to the defendant from the condemnation of said rights-of-way, privileges or easements across the same,&quot; assessed the defendant's damages at $ --0--, and estimated that the special benefits which the defendant would receive from the construction of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  proposed sewer and water lines, or both, would be $ 7,500.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 12 July 1965, the clerk entered judgment confirming the report of the commissioners, granting the city perpetual rights-of-way, privileges and easements as prayed for in the petition, and adjudging that the defendant is not entitled to receive anything as damages.  The judgment of the clerk states that the court found as a fact that more than 20 days had expired since the filing of the report of the commissioners and no exceptions or objections thereto had been filed or made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 19 July 1965, the defendant filed a motion before the clerk that the judgment of the clerk be set aside, that new commissioners be appointed and that the defendant be allowed to present evidence at a hearing before the commissioners.  In support of the motion, the defendant asserts that her receipt of a copy of this judgment of 12 July 1965 &quot;was the first information or notice of any proceedings that the landowner or the landowner's attorney had concerning this matter since filing the answer May 14, 1965.&quot; She asserts that she was never notified of the appointment of the commissioners or of their meeting or of the filing of their report.  She contends&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that she is entitled to notice of the meeting of the commissioners in order that she may present evidence to them and be represented by counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The motion to set aside the judgment was overruled by the clerk on the ground that &quot;no exceptions have been filed by the defendant to the report of the commissioners duly filed on April 5, [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] 1965,&quot; and that no sufficient evidence was introduced and no sufficient showing was made to justify the setting aside of the judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To these rulings by the clerk the defendant excepted and appealed.  The matter then came on for hearing before the judge, who found the facts above summarized, and also found that the defendant was given no &quot;additional notice&quot; of the meeting of the commissioners or of the filing of their report.  The court, being &quot;of the opinion that even if technical error was committed there is no reasonable probability that any additional appraisals, hearings, or trials in this connection would result in any recovery on the part of the defendant,&quot; dismissed the appeal from the clerk and refused to allow the motion of the defendant that she be permitted to examine the three commissioners, the clerk and the city attorney.  From&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this order the defendant appeals to this Court.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant landowner appealed a judgment from the Randolph County Superior Court (North Carolina) that dismissed the landowner's appeal after the clerk of the court overruled the landowner's motion to set aside the clerk's judgment that confirmed a report by commissioners that adjudged that the landowner was not entitled to damages in petitioner city's suit for permanent easements for the construction of sewer and/or water lines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The landowner sought just compensation for the land, which she alleged was $ 2.00 per running foot for the total length of the easements sought. No notice of the commissioners' findings or of their report to the clerk was given to the landowner. Reversing, the court said that the landowner was not asking for a new hearing. She had had no hearing at all, which was not a technical error, but was a denial of a fundamental right. The landowner's motion to set aside the judgment that confirmed the reports should have been allowed. In affirming the denial of the motion, the court below said that there was no reasonable probability that any additional appraisals, hearings, or trials would have resulted in any recovery by the landowner. That was not for the court or the superior court to determine, but could only have been determined only by commissioners appointed after a notice and a hearing required under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 40-16 who proceeded as directed by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 40-17. The commissioners' report did not purport to show any hearing by the commissioners of the proofs and allegations of the parties, as required by both the clerk's order to the commissioners and &sect; 40-17.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Peel, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, September 1965 Regular Non-jury Session of Wake, docketed in the Supreme Court as Case No. 543 and argued at the Fall Term 1965.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff instituted this action under G.S. 105-267 to recover the sum of $ 178,337.00 (with interest), which the original defendant W. A. Johnson, Commissioner of Revenue of North Carolina, demanded from it as additional income taxes for the years 1959 and 1960, and which plaintiff paid under protest.  W. A. Johnson thereafter resigned, and I. L. Clayton, present Commissioner of Revenue, was substituted as defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the case was called for trial, defendant demurred </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ore tenus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the complaint on the ground that the Superior Court had no original jurisdiction of the action and that plaintiff should have commenced the proceedings by a petition to the Tax Review Board, augmented by the presence of the Commissioner of Revenue.  The court overruled this demurrer, and defendant excepted.  The parties then stipulated the facts determinative of the controversy.  The stipulations relate to the years 1959 and 1960 and are summarized as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff is a Pennsylvania corporation authorized to do business in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  North Carolina, other states, and foreign countries.  It is engaged in producing oil and natural gas and in the refining, transporting, and marketing of petroleum products.  It carries on each of these activities under the direction of a vice-president in charge of a separate department, which operates independently of any other within plaintiff's organization.  Each department has its own budget, employees, and equipment, and is required to show an accounting of its expenses and income.  All transactions of plaintiff's marketing department with other departments or subsidiaries of plaintiff are and have been conducted at &quot;fair&quot; market value.  In North Carolina, plaintiff was engaged only in the business of marketing refined petroleum products and such accessory items as are customarily sold at gasoline filling stations.  All petroleum products which plaintiff sold in North Carolina were manufactured at its refinery in Port Arthur, Texas.  This refinery processed no oil from any foreign source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, owns all or at least 50% of the voting stock in the following subsidiary corporations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Gulf Exploration Company</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a Delaware corporation, is engaged in the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  purchase and sale of crude oil in Europe, Africa, and the Far East.  All the crude oil which Gulf Exploration Company sold was purchased from its wholly owned subsidiary, Gulf Kuwait Company, a corporation owning a one-half interest in an oil concession and refinery producing low-grade petroleum products in the Persian Gulf country of Kuwait.  Gulf Kuwait Company sold 2/3 of its crude oil to purchasers which had no connection with plaintiff and 1/3 to Gulf Exploration, which ultimately sold less than 1% of it to plaintiff.  None of this oil, which was processed in plaintiff's Philadelphia refinery, was sold or delivered in North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Gulf Iran Company</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a Delaware corporation, owns all the capital stock of Gulf International Company, which has an interest in an oil concession in Iran, where it produces and refines crude oil.  Gulf Iran Company engages chiefly in the purchase and sale of crude oil and carries on its business operations in the same manner as does Gulf Exploration Company.  In 1959, Gulf Iran Company sold no crude oil to plaintiff but did sell to it, at market price, some fuel oil for use in plaintiff's ships calling at Iranian ports.  All other crude oil&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and petroleum products which Gulf Iran purchased from Gulf International were sold and delivered outside of the United States to companies not connected with plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Gulf Italia Company</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a Delaware corporation, was engaged in the production and sale of crude oil in Sicily, where its business was conducted.  None of this oil was sold to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">British American Oil Company, Limited</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a Canadian corporation which duplicates the activities of plaintiff.  Its business is conducted from its offices in Canada.  In 1959, the corporation made no sales to plaintiff.  In 1960, at market price, it sold plaintiff some crude oil which plaintiff processed in Ohio and sold outside of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the subsidiary corporations listed above were domesticated in North Carolina, or owned property here, and none conducted any business activities within the State.  Business transactions between them and plaintiff were limited to those already enumerated, and all were conducted at fair market value, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">i.e.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, no benefit innured to plaintiff by reason of the corporate kinship.  No products from any of the subsidiaries ever had any connection whatever with North Carolina. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The earnings which produced the dividends which the subsidiaries paid plaintiff were all subject to taxation elsewhere, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">i.e.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in Kuwait, Iran, Italy and Canada, respectively.  The net income of each subsidiary is shown on separate books and records of accounts maintained by each entirely outside of North Carolina.  There is no interchange or sharing of patents or trademarks between them and plaintiff.  Each subsidiary paid its prorata share of the cost of every service which plaintiff or any other subsidiary performed for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following schedule indicates the dividends paid plaintiff by its subsidiaries, together with the income tax and interest which was assessed thereon by defendant, and paid under protest by plaintiff:</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Upon the foregoing stipulations, the trial judge &quot;found and concluded&quot;: Gulf Exploration Co., Gulf Iran Co., and Gulf Italia Co. were not engaged in a business of a type similar to that which plaintiff conducted in North Carolina.  They were operated as independent businesses, unrelated to plaintiff's activities in the State.  Plaintiff's business here in no way contributed to the dividends which the four subsidiaries paid it, and they derived no income from any activity or property in North Carolina.  The dividends here involved, therefore, did not constitute income which was reasonably attributable to any business activities conducted by plaintiff in this State, and defendant was without authority to subject these dividends to income taxation.  From judgment decreeing that the assessment was unlawful and that plaintiff is entitled to recover of the defendant the sum of $ 178,337.00, with interest at 6% from March 26, 1963, defendant appeals.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant Commissioner of Revenue of North Carolina demanded that plaintiff taxpayer pay additional income taxes for certain tax years. The taxpayer paid the amounts under protest, and then instigated an action to recover the funds, with interest. The Commissioner demurred, claiming that the lower court did not have original jurisdiction over the matter, and that it should have been commenced by petition to the Tax Review Board. The trial court overruled the demurer. Because the additional taxes paid by taxpayer were on income from the taxpayer's subsidiary corporations, which conducted all of their activities outside of North Carolina, the trial court found that the income was not reasonably attributable to any activities conducted by the taxpayer within North Carolina. Thus, the lower court concluded, the taxpayer did not owe North Carolina taxes on that income. The Commissioner appealed, but the court affirmed, holding that the taxpayer had complied with the provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 105-267, vesting the lower court with jurisdiction. The court further held that North Carolina could not tax the income of corporations doing business outside the state.</SPAN></P>

The North Carolina main stations averaged 80% of the total of Westco's main stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the test period 1 January 1963 through 31 December 1963, the company had operating revenues of $ 723,915, including $ 115,209 of rate increases collected under bond.  The average revenue per main station was $ 120.89.  Without the bonded increase it would have been $ 101.65.  Applying the increase in P-58, Sub 37, the revenue was $ 114.08 per station.  The company's operating expenses during the test period, excluding depreciation and taxes, were $ 279,533, being $ 46.68 per average station.  After all expenses, including depreciation, taxes, interest&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and other fixed charges, the company enjoyed final net income for 1963 of $ 86,884.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the refunds required under P-58, Sub 37, the final net income available to stockholders after all charges for 1963, including a book charge for Federal taxes of $ 19,458 which was not actually paid or owed, was $ 40,773.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the test period, according to the Commission's findings, the company earned a rate of return per company books of 4.54% including the bonded rate increase.  After the refunds under P-58, Sub 37, the actual rate of return will be 4.01% without the normalization of investment tax credits, or 3.45% after normalization.  After the refund under P-58, Sub 37, the return on equity will be 9.80% before normalization of the tax credit, or 6.64% after normalization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Westco had under construction for the calendar year 1964 a continuation of the major plant construction program to increase net plant from $ 3,929,100 at 31 December 1963 to $ 6,007,120 at 31 December 1964, an increase of plant of 52.9% during 1964.  This is an increase in stations in service from 7,234 to 9,784, or 35.3% increase in stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rate increases proposed in the application would produce $ 240,504&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of additional revenue over the rates approved prior to 11 March 1964, and $ 160,343 over the approved increase in P-58, Sub 37, allowed 11 March 1964.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rates for Westco's North Carolina exchanges have been increased substantially in P-58, Sub 37, signed 11 March 1964, effective 1 April 1964, plus further increases applied for here, whereas the exchanges located in Georgia have not received any increases since 1953, and were lower for a comparable size exchange than the North Carolina rates from 1953 to 1960.  Westco has never applied for a rate increase on its Georgia exchanges although an application in an undisclosed amount is proposed in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 13 August 1964, the Commission issued its order allowing rate increases amounting to approximately $ 39,000 additional revenue, being an average increase of 5% over the previous rates fixed in the rate increase allowed in P-58, Sub 37, effective 1 April 1964.  This increase amounted to approximately 24% of the $ 160,000&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  increase in revenue applied for by Westco.  The order prescribed new rate schedules and rate groupings based on the number of main stations and Private Branch Exchange (PBX) trunks in the respective exchanges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no dispute about the depreciated value of Westco's property dedicated to the rendering of service to the public on 31 December 1963 as being $ 3,929,101; to this figure, applicant contends, should be added plant under construction in the sum of $ 221,326, and materials and supplies in the sum of $ 48,662, a total of $ 4,199,089.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission found that the fair value of applicant's property used and useful in providing the service rendered to the public within the State of North Carolina, considering the reasonable original cost of the properties, less those portions of the cost which have been consumed by previous use recovered by depreciation expense, the replacement or reproduction cost of the properties, and other factors relevant to the fair value of the properties, as of 31 December 1963, was $ 4,120,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From this order Westco appealed direct to the Supreme Court under G.S. 62-99.  The Supreme Court held that the statute granting direct appeal was unconstitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and dismissed the appeal, with the right of the appellant to file the appeal in the Superior Court of Wake County within 60 days, which the appellant did.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">State ex rel Utilities Commission v.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The utility filed for a rate increase after it was created as a spin-off from another utility. Further, the utility created new exchanges and engaged in plant expansion. While the Commission gave the utility a rate increase, the increase was not as high as the utility would have liked. On appeal, the utility challenged the valuation of its property and the conclusion that 3.8 percent was a fair and reasonable rate of return. On appeal, the court found no errors. The court noted that it was the duty of the Commission, and not the courts, to set utility rates. Such rates were presumed just and reasonable. Under that standard, the court could not say that the Commission erred. There was no error in assessing the fair value of the property at greater than reconstruction cost, although the usual habit was the opposite. Under the above mentioned presumption concerning rates, the rate was reasonable as it allowed the utility a fair return on its investment. The utility was left with net operating income. Further, the Commission had to consider the needs of the public, and the rate was sufficient to provide service to areas that otherwise would not have telephone service.</SPAN></P>

Thus, defendant argued that it naturally followed that if the legislature's intent was not served then the statute was unconstitutional on its face. The court held that there was no error in the trial court's proceedings, and that the legislature intended in its original and amended versions of the statute to punish persons who undertook to satisfy their sexual urges in a manner that was offensive to the public morality and decency.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This criminal prosecution originated in the Recorder's Court of the City of Charlotte.  The Superintendent of Building Inspection of the City, by affidavit, charged that on June 23, 1964, the defendant, James R. Walker, unlawfully, maliciously, and wilfully did violate Section 5-4(c) of the City Code by remodeling and repairing his residence located at 1447 South Church Street without first applying for and obtaining a written permit from the Building Inspection Department of the City in violation of G.S. 14-4.  The defendant was arrested and brought into Recorder's Court under a warrant based on the Superintendent's affidavit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the trial, the defendant moved to quash the warrant and dismiss the prosecution upon the ground (1) that Section 5-4(c) is unconstitutional in that it violates the defendant's &quot;inalienable and vested right of use, possession, and maintenance of the residence described in the warrant . . . and said warrant is in conflict therewith; (2) that the conduct described in the said Code and in the warrant is privileged conduct&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  protected by the North Carolina Constitution . . . and . . . the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution; (3) that any verdict rendered . . . would be an unconstitutional abridgment . . . of the defendant's rights . . . and immunities as a property owner, . . . (including) defendant's right of renovation and repair of his residence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Recorder overruled the motion to quash, heard the evidence offered by the prosecution, consisting of the City Code, testimony as to the dilapidated condition of the defendant's residence, the finding that it was unfit for habitation, beyond reasonable repair, and could be neither altered nor improved so as to meet the minimum requirements of the Charlotte Housing Code.  The Superintendent of Building Inspection, upon the findings, ordered the dwelling demolished or removed.  The defendant undertook to do repair work himself without applying for or receiving any permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant did not testify.  However, he offered the City Housing Code (apparently for the purpose of attacking it).  The Recorder's Court entered a verdict of guilty.  From the judgment imposed, the defendant appealed to the Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Superior Court the State&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  repeated the evidence and the defendant repeated the motions made and heard before the Recorder's Court.

The motion was overruled. Evidence was presented that the residence was unfit for human habitation and could not be improved so as to meet the city's requirements.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 10, 1961, the Sheriff of Mecklenburg County returned the summons endorsed &quot;after due and diligent search Richard Dix Hanby not to be found in Mecklenburg County.&quot; An alias summons was issued to Mecklenburg County on July 31, 1961, and returned on August 14, 1961, similarly endorsed.  On July 15, 1963, plaintiff amended her complaint by changing the spelling of defendant's name from &quot;Hanby&quot; to &quot;Hanvey.&quot; The following day, July 16, 1963, summons was issued for Hanvey and forwarded with the following notation: &quot;Richard Dix Hanvey has lived at 1705 South Boulevard, Charlotte; 2430 North Brevard, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Charlotte, and 1029 Louise Ave., Charlotte.&quot; This summons was returned July 26, 1963, unserved.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 15, 1963, the day the complaint was amended, W. R. Battley, attorney for plaintiff, made an affidavit in which he averred, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>

Upon receipt of this letter Insurer referred the matter to the firm of Smith, Moore, Smith, Schell &amp; Hunter, Attorneys, who immediately sought to locate defendant through the adjusting firm which handled the investigation of the accident in 1960.  It reported to counsel that neither defendant's mother nor his mother-in-law had seen defendant in a year; that defendant had not gotten in touch with the adjusting firm, with Insurer, or with counsel; and that &quot;his whereabouts are unknown.&quot; This information is contained in an affidavit dated December 2, 1964, by Richmond G.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 6, 1964, counsel for Insurer, pursuant to its right and obligation to control and defend the litigation against its insured, entered a special appearance and moved the court &quot;to order the purported service of process on this defendant by publication be quashed, that the order for service of process by publication be set aside, and that the action be dismissed for want of jurisdiction over this defendant&quot; for that: (1) no personal service of process has&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  been made on defendant and no property attached; (2) G.S. 1-98.2(6), which purports &quot;to establish in personam jurisdiction in cases of this kind,&quot; is unconstitutional as a violation of due process; (3) there has been no hearing to determine judicially that defendant has departed the state, and service of process upon him based solely upon the affidavit of counsel deprives him of due process of law; (4) plaintiff has failed to comply with G.S. 1-98.4(1); (5) the form of notice failed to comply with G.S. 1-99.3, in that it did not warn defendant that upon his failure to make defense plaintiff would apply to the court for the relief sought; (6) the clerk failed to mail a notice of the service of process to defendant as required by G.S. 1-99.2; (7) the newspaper in which the notice was published in Iredell County was not calculated to give defendant, a one-time resident of Mecklenburg County, notice of the pending action, and, therefore, deprived him of due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the matter was heard on December 3, 1964, counsel for plaintiff filed an additional affidavit, wherein he recited the unsuccessful efforts of the sheriff to locate defendant in Charlotte and his own efforts to locate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  him through the Department of Motor Vehicles, which informed him that when defendant's driver's license expired September 9, 1963, it was not renewed.  Judge McConnell entered an order in which he held that plaintiff had met the statutory provisions relating to service by publication and that the service of summons in this case was valid.  He also overruled defendant's challenges to the constitutionality of G.S. 1-98.2(6).  Defendant excepted and appealed.  </SPAN></P>

The sheriff returned the summons claiming that the driver could not be found in the county. The passenger issued seven more summonses, and the driver was not found. Service of process was then made by publication. The trial court entered judgment for the passenger and denied the driver's motion to quash the service. On appeal, the court reversed the decision. The court found that the service by publication was defective under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-98.2(6) because the passenger never alleged that the driver departed from the state or concealed himself to avoid service of process. The court held that the attorney's affidavit, upon which the notice by publication occurred, was defective because the affidavit contained no reference to the driver's residence. The court concluded that the publication notice was also defective because it failed to inform the driver the penalty for failing to make defense.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion and ruled that jurisdiction had been acquired. The franchisor appealed.

N. Spruill from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Fountain, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in Chambers, 29 December 1964.  From Currituck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action was instituted by the North Carolina Turnpike Authority (Authority) under the Declaratory Judgment Act, Gen. Stats., ch. 1, art. 26, to determine: (1) the constitutionality of Sess. Laws of 1963, ch. 757, codified as Gen. Stats., ch. 136, art. 6E (the Act); and (2) whether, if the Act is constitutional, Authority can legally construct a turnpike in two phases, the first phase being a two-lane highway with only one lane for traffic in each direction, the second phase, multiple lanes in each direction.  Authority is a body politic and corporate created by the Act, which expressly constitutes it a public agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislative purpose in creating Authority is declared by G.S. 136-89.59 to be &quot;to provide for the construction of modern highways and express highways or superhighways embodying safety devices, including center division, ample shoulder widths, long-sight distances, multiple lanes in each direction and grade separation at intersections with other highways and railroads, and thereby facilitate vehicular traffic, provide better connection&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  between the highway system of North Carolina and the highway systems of the adjoining states, remove many of the present handicaps and hazards on the congested highways in the State and promote the agricultural and industrial development of the State. . . .&quot; To effectuate this purpose, G.S. 136-89.63 empowers Authority, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;5. To construct, maintain, repair and operate turnpike projects at such locations within the State as may be determined by the Authority and approved by the State Highway Commission. . . .  (N)o turnpike or toll road shall be constructed or operated in this State unless and until a certificate of approval be first obtained from the State Highway Commission certifying that the operation of such toll road or turnpike will not be harmful or injurious to the secondary or primary roads embraced in the system of State highways;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;6. To issue turnpike revenue bonds of the Authority for any of its corporate purposes, payable solely from the tolls and revenues pledged for their payment, and to refund its bonds, all as provided in this article * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Act provides that the revenue bonds issued under its grant of power to Authority &quot;shall not be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  deemed to constitute a debt of the State or of any political subdivision thereof or a pledge of the faith and credit of the State or of any political subdivision.&quot; It requires a statement to this effect on the face of every bond issued.  G.S. 136-89.60.  From funds acquired under the Act, Authority is empowered to acquire by purchase or condemnation such property of every kind as may be necessary for the construction and operation of any approved project.  G.S. 136-89.64.  It is also authorized to accept federal grants and, from any source, gifts of land, money, or labor, G.S. 136-89.63(13), as well as &quot;to do all acts and things necessary or convenient to carry out the powers expressly granted in this article,&quot; G.S. 136-89.63(14).  This latter includes the power &quot;to employ consulting engineer, attorneys, accountants, construction experts, superintendents, managers, and such other employees and agents as may be necessary in its judgment, and to fix their compensation, and to employ financial experts and fiscal agents with the advice and approval of the Local Government Commission; provided, however, that the provisions of G.S. 159-20 shall be complied with to the extent that the same&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  shall be applicable,&quot; G.S. 136-89.63(12).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As originally enacted, the Act expressly provided, G.S. 136-89.77, that Authority &quot;shall not construct more than one turnpike project, which project shall not exceed one hundred (100) miles in length, until the General Assembly shall have reviewed the activities of the Authority&quot; and specifically authorized additional projects.  On June 16, 1965, by S.B. 532, the General Assembly repealed G.S. 136-89.77 in its entirety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts out of which the controversy arises are undisputed.  Admissions in the answer establish them to be as stated in the complaint, which is here summarized:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authority has determined to construct a turnpike project along the Outer Banks of North Carolina, commencing at or near Duck, Dare County, and extending north through Currituck County, a distance of about 29.30 miles, to a point near the North Carolina-Virginia boundary.  The location of the Outer Banks Turnpike has been established, and on October 1, 1964, defendant State Highway Commission duly approved its location and determined that the turnpike would not be injurious to the secondary or primary roads of the State.  In compliance with G.S. 136-89.63(5), it&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  issued its certificate to that effect.  Authority determined that it would not be economically feasible, in the beginning, to develop and construct the turnpike as a highway with multiple traffic lanes in each direction, but that it would be economically feasible to do so in successive phases.  It has therefore provided for the development of the project in two phases, the first to be a two-lane highway providing one traffic lane in each direction, the second, on later determination of economic feasibility, a four-lane highway providing two traffic lanes in each direction, with a center division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On or about July 1, 1964, Authority entered into a contract with defendant W. N. Spruill, whereby the latter was employed to serve as Engineering Consultant with respect to the planning and development of the turnpike.  This employment is authorized by the Act.  His compensation is dependent upon Authority's power to issue and sell its revenue bonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Pine Island, Inc. is the owner of a tract of land, portions of which are embraced within the projected right of way of the proposed turnpike.  Pine Island has heretofore conveyed to Authority by deed of gift, dated November 16, 1964, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a portion of its lands located within the projected right of way of the turnpike for use only as part of the turnpike.  The deed contains a clause whereunder title to such lands will revert in the event the turnpike shall fail to qualify as a &quot;turnpike project&quot; under the Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bona fide controversy exists between plaintiff and defendants Pine Island and Spruill in regard to legal questions, which involve the constitutionality of the Act and the interpretation of certain provisions of it.  They contend: (1) that the Act violates N. C. Const., Art. I, &sect; 8; Art. II, &sect; 14; Art. V, &sect; 4; Art. II, &sect; 29; and (2) that the Act does not authorize plaintiff to construct, maintain and operate the proposed turnpike in phases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Highway Commission and the Attorney General were made parties defendant under G.S. 1-260.  They, however, contend, with Authority, that the Act is constitutional and authorizes the construction of the turnpike in two phases, as Authority contemplates doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After hearing the matter Judge Fountain adjudged that the Act violates no provision of the Constitution of North Carolina and empowers Authority to proceed with the project in two phases, as planned.  From&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his judgment defendants Pine Island and Spruill appeal.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendants appealed the lower court's declaratory judgment finding that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 136 did not violate any provision of the Constitution of North Carolina and empowered the plaintiff to proceed with the project in two phases, as planned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff, an agency created by the North Carolina General Assembly, was granted the authority to create a state turnpike. Plaintiff planned a two-lane turnpike along the shoreline and planned to extend the road to a four-lane highway by sections. The court ruled the statute that granted plaintiff's authority, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 136, was constitutional and plaintiff could create the turnpike by sections. The General Assembly provided sufficient standards to guide the plaintiff. The powers granted to plaintiff regarding the location were no broader than the powers granted to the state highway commission. The highway's ingress or egress was also properly determined. The tolls were set by reasonable standards. There were sufficient standards regarding the bonds because the authority to spend was circumscribed by the authority to do, i.e., to construct and maintain toll roads, to collect the revenues therefrom, and out of them to retire the bonds. The tolls were not taxes and did not raise money on the credit of the state and did not violate N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 14. The act also did not violate N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 29 because it was not a local legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Declaratory judgment was affirmed since the general assembly did not violate the state constitution where it provided sufficient standards to evaluate the need for and the details of a state turnpike; it also allowed for the establishment of non-tax tolls and regulations that did not raise money on the credit of the state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant is the owner of the Walkertown Country Club, located in a structure which is approximately 280 yards from a Baptist church building in rural Forsyth County outside the city limits of any incorporated town.  This church never holds services after 11:00 p.m. or before daylight.  For the past ten years defendant has operated this club, except on holidays, only one night a week, Saturday.  He charges an admission fee and sells sandwiches, soft drinks, potato chips, tobacco, and similar items.  To assist him, he employs 13 persons, of whom 5 are musicians -- a drummer, saxaphone player, guitar player, and two vocalists form a &quot;combo.&quot; Defendant also has a phonograph.  There are no loud speakers outside the building.  Most of the patrons of this club do not arrive until 11:00 p.m. or afterwards, and defendant usually operates until approximately 3:00 a.m. on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night of April 25, 1964, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  between 100 and 150 persons came to defendant's club.  They were dancing, sitting in parties at various tables, talking, having snacks to eat and something to drink.

When defendant closed his club at 3:00 a.m. on April 26, 1964, a deputy sheriff arrested him under a warrant, issued by the Clerk of the Municipal Court of the City of Winston-Salem, which charged:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

The superior court overruled the demurrer and denied the motion to quash. The court held that the ordinance had to fail under the club owner's challenge as to its constitutionality. 1953 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 1071, &sect; 1(3), as amended by 1961 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 943, &sect; 1 1/2(3), has a legitimate aim of using police power, yet the means employed to achieve this end exceeded what was reasonably necessary to accomplish such end. No sound reason appeared as to why during the mentioned hours night clubs had to be closed in order to curb disturbance of public worship. For this reason, the resolution denied substantive due process and the order of the superior court was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Carr, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, March 1, 1965, Regular Civil Session of Wake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action was instituted on 3 April 1964, as a class action, to permanently enjoin the enforcement by defendants of an ordinance or regulation entitled &quot;Resolution Regulating Sunday Sales of Goods, Wares and Merchandise&quot; adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of Wake County on 2 March 1964.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resolution was adopted pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 1060 of the Session Laws of 1963, codified as G.S. 153-9(55).  It purports to make it unlawful, effective 31 March 1964, &quot;to conduct, operate or engage in or carry on within Wake County on Sunday any business.&quot; Certain specified classes or types of business are excluded; amusements, games and sports are permitted after 1:00 P.M. on Sundays.  The regulation applies &quot;within the corporate limits and jurisdiction of any incorporated city or town (in Wake County), whose governing body, by resolution, agrees to this ordinance or regulation.&quot; The City Council of the City of Raleigh adopted a resolution on 2 March 1964 agreeing to the regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff seeks a permanent injunction to prevent the enforcement of the regulation by the Sheriff&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and County Commissioners of Wake County.  Plaintiff complains and alleges in substance that it has and maintains a mercantile business in the City of Raleigh, it sells merchandise on Sunday, the sale of much of its merchandise is prohibited by the ordinance, its Sunday sales (and such sales of similar businesses) of goods thus prohibited is a substantial &quot;dollar-volume of business,&quot; the enforcement of the regulation will cause irreparable injury to plaintiff and those similarly situated and they have no adequate remedy at law, and the ordinance and the statute pursuant to which it was adopted are unconstitutional (specifying).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A temporary restraining order was issued.  On 13 April 1964 defendants demurred to the complaint on the ground that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.  At the hearing on 17 April 1964, Bickett, J., sustained the demurrer and dismissed the action, but, in his discretion and pursuant to G.S. 1-500, he continued the temporary restraining order until the case could be heard and determined on appeal.  The appeal was heard in Supreme Court at the Fall Term 1964, and the opinion, delivered by Parker, J., was filed 29 January&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1965.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Surplus Co. v. Pleasants</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 263 N.C. 587, 139 S.E. 2d 892. See that opinion for a more particular recital of the allegations of the original complaint.  We affirmed the ruling below sustaining the demurrer, for the reason that the original complaint did not set out the resolutions of the County Commissioners and City Council, matters of which we could not take judicial notice, and for the further reason that the facts alleged in the complaint did not show that plaintiff and those similarly situated were aggrieved by the regulation.  We reversed the dismissal of the action, however, because of plaintiff's right to move for leave to amend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 22 February 1965 plaintiff moved to amend the complaint and for temporary injunction.  Pless, J., heard the motions, issued temporary restraining order, and granted plaintiff leave to amend.  Plaintiff filed amendment to the complaint on 1 March 1965, supplying the resolutions and deficiencies noted in our former opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants again demurred on the ground that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, asserting with specificity that the statute,&nbsp;G.S. 153-9(55), and the resolutions adopted pursuant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  thereto are valid and constitutional, and that plaintiff may not challenge the constitutionality of the statute in an action to enjoin its enforcement.  The demurrer was sustained, but the temporary restraining order was continued (G.S. 1-500) pending the outcome of appeal to the Supreme Court.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff retailers sought to enjoin defendants, the county sheriff and the individual members of the county board of commissioners, from enforcing a county ordinance that imposed a Sunday closing law. On remand from a prior appeal in the case, the retailers amended their complaint. The Wake County trial court (North Carolina) sustained defendants' demurrer but continued a temporary restraining order. The retailers sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The county ordinance was adopted pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 153-9(55), which conferred upon county commissioners the power and authority to enact Sunday observance laws. On appeal, the retailers contended that &sect; 153-9(55) was void because it was a local statute that contravened N.C. art. II, &sect; 29. The court agreed with this contention. The court found that art. II, &sect; 29, prohibited local legislation regulating labor, trade, mining, or manufacturing. The court further found that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 153-9(55) was a local statute because it excepted 48 counties from its operation. The court further found that this classification was not based on any reasonable or uniform circumstances, but that it was arbitrary, discriminatory, and capricious. In particular, the court noted that &sect; 153-9(55) did not suggest any reasonable distinction, germane to the purpose for which a Sunday observance law was designed, between the counties included in this law and those excluded from it. Thus, the court concluded that &sect; 153-9(55) was void by the express provisions of N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 29.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Under &sect; 105-228.5, the insurers paid taxes on revenue from insurance contracts for fire and lightning coverage, excluding marine and automobile insurance contracts. The insurers argued that the tax money funded the State Firemen's Pension Fund. The insurers contended that the legislature was not allowed to fund the plan directly with insurers' tax proceeds, so lawmakers attempted to do it indirectly. On appeal, the court found that in 1961 the legislature disassociated taxes on insurance premiums from the appropriation which the State made to the Firemen's Pension Fund. The court held that the appropriation was neither diminished nor increased by the amount received from the tax levied on insurance companies. The court found that the appropriation made to the fund stood on an equal footing with all other appropriations. In affirming, the court held that the 1961 statute corrected the unconstitutional features of the 1959 law. The court held that the statute was rendered valid by amendment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The twelve great nieces and great nephews named in testator's will, natural born children of testator's nieces and nephews, are living and parties to this proceeding.  In addition to the twelve great nieces and great nephews named in the will, flve children have been born to testator's nieces and nephews since his death.  These five are: Julia A. Marks, Simmons H. Worth, Mary G. Andrews, John W. Andrews and Sara S. Andrews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the twenty-eight natural born nieces and nephews, great nieces and great nephews of testator, whose right to participate in the distribution of the income of the trust estate is conceded by all parties, there are four adopted children, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">i.e.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, S. Leigh Park, Bruce R. Park, Mabel Y. Andrews and A. B. Andrews, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jr., who assert their right to participate in the distribution of the income and corpus of the trust estate.  S. Leigh Park and Bruce R. Park are adopted children of Julia A. Park, niece of testator.  S. Leigh Park was adopted in May 1950.  Bruce R. Park was adopted in April 1951.  Mabel Y. Andrews and A. B. Andrews, Jr. are adopted children of A. B. Andrews, III, testator's nephew.  Mabel was adopted in March 1957, and A. B. Andrews, Jr., in March 1960.  All adoption proceedings were had in the Superior Court of Wake County.  Each was regular and conclusive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of claims made by or on behalf of the four adopted children that they, by virtue of their adoption and the provisions of c. 967, S.L. 1963 (now codified as G.S. 48-23), were beneficiaries of the trust estate and entitled to participate therein, plaintiff, as trustee, instituted this action to obtain a judicial determination of the rights of the parties and its duties as trustee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The natural born nieces, nephews, great nieces and great nephews, who answered, asserted the adopted children were not, by the Act of 1963, beneficiaries of the trust for that: (1) The Act did not apply to the trust; and (2) if it were applicable, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it is unconstitutional since it violates the provisions of Art. 1, &sect; 17, of the Constitution of North Carolina, Art. 1, &sect; 10(1), and &sect; 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Carr concluded: &quot;That within the meaning of G.S. 48-23(c), it does not plainly appear from the terms of the Will of Alexander B. Andrews that the words 'great nieces' and 'great nephews' were intended to exclude children adopted by the nieces and nephews of Alexander B. Andrews.&quot; He further concluded that the eleven nieces and nephews and twelve great nieces and great nephews, named in the will, took, on testator's death, a vested estate; this estate could only be opened to permit a natural born great niece or great nephew to benefit from the trust fund; the 1963 Act, purporting to include the four adopted children as beneficiaries of the fund, was void, because prohibited by the Constitution of North Carolina and the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The decedent's will created a trust for the benefit of his brothers, sisters, nieces, and nephews. The trust provided that the nieces and nephews' shares passed to his great-nieces and nephews. It made no mention of adopted great-nieces and nephews. The trustee filed an action to determine whether the great-nieces and nephews were entitled to participate in the trust. The great-nieces and nephews were represented by the guardian ad litem. The trial court ruled that the trust was not open to the great-nieces and nephews. It further held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 48-23, by which the trust was purported to include the adopted children, was unconstitutional. The guardian ad litem sought review and the court affirmed. The court found that &sect; 48-23, which granted adopted children rights equal to those of natural born children, stated that the words &quot;child,&quot; &quot;grandchild,&quot; or an equivalent thereof in any will included an adopted person. However, the court ruled that this section did not apply retroactively. Because the decedent died in 1946, the statute did not apply. Further, the court said that the statute could not have applied because it had the effect of divesting the vested heirs.</SPAN></P>

On November 7, 1963, the Attorney General, as authorized by G.S. 62-20, intervened &quot;on behalf of the using and consuming public.&quot; On November 12, 1963, the parties named in the caption as protestants, who are customers of Western, filed a joint &quot;Protest.&quot; After extended hearings in November 1963, the Commission (two Commissioners dissenting) approved a new schedule of rates and charges allowing in part the increases sought by Western.  The Attorney General and the protestants filed &quot;exceptions&quot; to said order and gave notice of appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The utility company filed an application for approval of proposed increases in its rates and charges. Appellants filed protests against the new rates. The Commission approved the new schedule and appellants sought direct review in the state supreme court. The court dismissed the appeal on the ground that it did not have jurisdiction over a direct appeal of the Commission's action. The court found that the first question was whether it had jurisdiction to review a decision by the Commission without intermediate review in the superior court. The court acknowledged that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 62-99 (1965) stated that an appeal from a Commission order granting or denying a rate increase was to be made directly to the supreme court. However, the court said, N.C. Const. art. IV distinguished between administrative agencies and the courts. Under N.C. Const. art. IV, &sect; 10, moreover, the jurisdiction of the supreme court was limited to review on appeal of decisions of the courts below. This did not include the jurisdiction to review on direct appeal the decisions of administrative agencies, the court said. The court held N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 62-99 (1965) unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

Further, the merchant could not attack the Sunday observance ordinance on the ground of its uncertainty as to what articles were permitted by the ordinance to be sold by other merchants exempt from the ordinance because a person was entitled to attack the constitutionality of a legislative act only if he himself was in immediate danger of sustaining a direct injury therefrom. A municipal ordinance proscribing all merchandising within the city on Sunday and exempting from the ordinance merchants selling certain commodities having a relationship to the public health and the enjoyment of Sunday as a day of rest and recreation, was constitutional.

The words of the resolution were not set forth in the complaint. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's judgment as modified. The company's complaint was fatally defective. The case as made by the complaint did not show that the company, engaged in business in the city of Raleigh, and those businesses like it engaged in similar business in the city of Raleigh, had been aggrieved by the resolution.

They were then appraised and valued at these figures: Parcel No. 1, $ 26,930.00; Parcel No. 2, $ 6,600.00; Parcel No. 3, $ 32,500.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to Thursday after the third Monday in August 1963 (G.S. 105-339), the taxing authorities of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County fixed the tax rate for 1963.  Taxes were computed on plaintiff's lots at the rate and appraised values for 1963.  The books showing the taxes so levied were delivered to the tax collector for collection prior to September 24, 1963.  On that date, plaintiff paid the taxes then charged to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his properties.  Receipts showing payment were then given plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 13, 1963, the Board of Equalization and Review, &quot;acting upon its own motion and without any appeal having been taken by plaintiff or by any other person from the assessments made and the taxes levied theretofore against said three parcels of land by the said Tax Supervisor as part of the regular octennial revaluation for the year 1963, made a new determination and so notified plaintiff of the assessed values of said three parcels of land for the year 1963 and increased the same for said year to the assessed values stated as follows: Parcel No. 1 -- $ 32,405.00; Parcel No. 2 -- $ 22,140.00; Parcel No. 3 -- $ 86,435.00.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tax books were in February 1964 revised by substituting the values of plaintiff's lots as determined in December 1963 for the appraised value.  Tax liability was then computed on the substituted values at the rate fixed by the taxing authorities in August 1963.  The tax collector demanded payment of the difference between the amount which plaintiff had theretofore paid and the amount asserted to be owing because of the change in values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[T]he Board of Equalization and Review finally&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  adjourned its sessions for the tax year 1963 on March 26, 1964, and that it recessed from time to time without final adjournment until March 26, 1964.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on the foregoing findings, the court concluded that plaintiff's lands were liable for the additional sum, as contended by the tax collector.  Plaintiff excepted and appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed an order from a Mecklenburg County trial court (North Carolina), which found the taxpayer liable for additional taxes assessed by defendants, the North Carolina Charlotte-Mecklenburg County Tax Collector, Mecklenburg County, and the City of Charlotte, upon lots owned by the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The taxpayer paid his property tax bill for a particular tax year. The Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, Board of Equalization and Review, on its own motion, reassessed the value of the taxpayer's lots and the Collector demanded payment of the difference between what the taxpayer had paid and the new tax calculated based upon the new assessed valuation of the taxpayer's lots. On appeal, the court determined that, under the Machinery Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-271 et seq., the Board was without the authority to increase the value of the taxpayer's lots, after the taxpayer had paid the taxes assessed. The court concluded that 1963 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 281 (the Act) did not give the Board the power to increase the appraised value of the taxpayer's property but gave the Board the power to act on appeals by property owners. The court found that to interpret the Act as giving the Board special power that no other county had been received would have required the court to construe the Act in a manner repugnant to N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 29.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action to declare invalid and enjoin enforcement of ordinances of the City of Charlotte.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seven named plaintiffs, and other persons, firms or corporations in whose behalf this class action was instituted, &quot;are engaged in the retail sale and distribution of ice cream and related products from motor vehicles in and about the City of Charlotte,&quot; and utilize the public streets in their business.  Each has &quot;some type of bell or musical instrument or other device affixed to his or its motor vehicle which is used for the purpose of attracting the attention of the public and of inviting patronage for the advertisement and sale of his or its ice cream and other related products from his or its motor vehicles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs set forth in their complaint the ordinance provisions they attack, being all of Section 13-52 and a part of Section 13-53 of Article III of the Code of the City of Charlotte, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 13-52: &quot;LOUD, DISTURBING AND UNNECESSARY NOISES -- PROHIBITED.  It shall be unlawful for any person to create, assist in creating, permit, continue or permit the continuance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of any unreasonably loud, disturbing or unnecessary noise in the city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 13-53: &quot;SAME -- ACTS CONSTRUED.  The following acts, among others, are declared to be loud, disturbing, annoying and unnecessary noises in violation of this article, but said enumeration shall not be deemed to be exclusive: . . . (f) SHOUTING, ETC., TO ATTRACT ATTENTION.  To make any noise upon a public street . . . by any kind of crying, calling, or shouting or by means of any whistle, rattle, bell, gong, clapper, horn, hammer, drum, musical instrument, or other device for the purpose of attracting attention or of inviting patronage of any persons to any business whatsoever; or thereby to cause annoyance to persons upon any street or public place or to persons in neighboring premises or otherwise create a public nuisance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, as Chief of the Charlotte Police Department, is charged with the responsibility of enforcing the ordinances of the City of Charlotte.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs allege, and defendant denies, that plaintiffs are subject to the provisions of G.S. 105-87 entitled &quot;Motor advertisers,&quot; relating to license taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs allege, and defendant denies, that plaintiffs will not be able &quot;to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  remain in this type of business&quot; if they are unable &quot;to utilize some type of bell, musical instrument or other device to attract attention and to invite patronage by advertising as aforesaid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs allege, and defendant denies, that plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs allege, and defendant denies, that the quoted ordinance provisions are invalid because (1) repugnant to G.S. 105-87 and (2) violative of designated provisions of the State and Federal Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant admits &quot;that the plaintiffs, and each of them, have been instructed by the agents, servants and employees of the defendant to cease entirely the continued use of any type of bell, musical instrument or other similar device for the purpose of attracting attention and of inviting patronage to their business of selling ice cream and related products under the pains of arrest,&quot; and that plaintiffs &quot;have been informed that the defendant, his agents, servants and employees, will make, or cause to be made, arrests of any persons, firms or corporations, which include the plaintiffs herein, for the violation of the aforesaid City ordinances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A temporary restraining order issued by Judge Froneberger&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on July 12, 1963, simultaneously with the institution of this action, was, by order of August 21, 1963, signed by Judge Bone, continued in effect until the final hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause was before Judge Pless for final hearing.  The order entered by Judge Pless, bearing date of March 31, 1964, after reciting that the cause was before him for the purpose of determining whether the order of Judge Bone should be made permanent and after quoting the challenged ordinance provisions, concludes as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Court is of the opinion that the determination as to whether or not a noise is unreasonably loud or disturbing is one that would have to be determined by the nature, extent, volume, raucousness or lack of it, of the particular instrument used, and therefore, that to issue an Order preventing the arrest of any of the plaintiffs without regard to the nature of the instrument to be used would be, in effect, to prejudge the question of whether or not the instrument was unreasonably loud or disturbing, and that the only proper way to determine the question would be upon the trial of a person based upon the evidence applicable to that particular case and the instrument used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Court, therefore, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is of the opinion that the plaintiffs are not entitled to the relief sought and denies the same; without prejudice to the right of the plaintiffs, and each of them, upon their arrest or indictment to have the matter fully determined based upon the evidence at it may appear in the trial of that prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED AND DECREED that the temporary Order of Judge Bone be, and the same is hereby vacated and set aside.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs excepted and appealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereupon, the court, exercising the discretionary power conferred by G.S. 1-500, ordered that the restraining order remain in effect pending disposition of plaintiffs' appeal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff ice cream vendors appealed from a decision of a Mecklenburg County trial court (North Carolina), which vacated a temporary restraining order prohibiting defendant city police chief from enforcing Charlotte, N.C., Ordinance, art. III, &sect;&sect; 13-52, 13-53, and held that the vendors were not entitled to an injunction against enforcement of said ordinances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The vendors, who were engaged in the sale of ice cream from motor vehicles, challenged the validity of Charlotte, N.C., Ordinance, art. III, &sect;&sect; 13-52, 13-53, which prohibited the making of any noise upon a public street by any of certain means, including a whistle, bell, or horn. The vendors had been instructed to cease from the use of any type of bell or musical instrument for the purpose of attracting attention but had not been arrested for alleged violations of the ordinance provisions. The vendors sought an injunction against enforcement of the statute, and the trial court vacated a previous interlocutory restraining order. The court affirmed, holding that an injunction did not lie to restrain enforcement of an ordinance creating a criminal offense. The court held that any vendor who was later prosecuted for violation of the ordinance could allege the unconstitutionality of such ordinance as a defense to prosecution, and thus the vendors had an adequate remedy at law. The court held that the issue of whether any ordinance provision had been violated and the validity of such provision had to be considered in the context of a specific factual situation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court affirmed the order vacating the interlocutory restraining order and remanded with a direction that a judgment dismissing the vendors' action be entered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff from an order of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Clark, S. J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 17 August 1964, Schedule &quot;C&quot; nonjury Session of Mecklenburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suit instituted 23 July 1964 under the Declaratory Judgment Act, G.S. 1-253&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, by plaintiff against the city of Charlotte, a municipal corporation, and its Superintendent of Building Inspection and its Chief Housing Inspector for a declaration of the unconstitutionality of and a permanent injunction against the enforcement of ordinances of the city of Charlotte and of the State statutes, which authorize the enactment of such ordinances by the city of Charlotte, which ordinances provide, in part, that no person shall enlarge, alter, or repair any structure, or part thereof, in the city of Charlotte without first making application and obtaining a written permit from the inspection department therefor, and which further provide that any building, or part thereof, in the city which is in such a condition as to be dangerous to the health, safety or lives of the occupants, the general public or persons passing near or living in the vicinity, or dangerous to the security of adjoining property or especially dangerous to the lives of fire fighters in case of fire&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  shall be held to be unsafe, and the inspector shall have the authority and it shall be his duty to declare such buildings unsafe and to take the necessary action to have such unsafe conditions corrected or removed, heard upon an order dated 23 July 1964 requiring defendants to show cause why a temporary injunction should not be issued pending a final hearing upon the merits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Judge Clark's order, the order to show cause was heard by him solely on arguments by plaintiff, a lawyer, appearing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">in propria persona</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and by counsel for the defendants.  According to the record before us, it seems neither plaintiff nor defendants offered any evidence before Judge Clark: there is no evidence in the record.  There is nothing in the record to indicate that plaintiff offered his complaint as an affidavit in evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it is necessary to summarize the crucial allegations of fact and conclusions of law in plaintiff's complaint for an understanding of this appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff, who is engaged in the ministry and the general practice of the law in the State, is the owner of a six-room frame dwelling located at 1449 South Church Street in the city of Charlotte.  The building was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  formerly a church, and in 1901 was converted into a six-room dwelling.  There is nothing in the complaint to indicate when plaintiff purchased the dwelling.  He &quot;vacated&quot; the premises -- the complaint does not allege when -- in order to make alterations and repairs to meet his personal needs, and while it was vacant its porch, windows, and doors were extensively damaged by hoodlums, but even now it is in sound condition, and free from all dangers to the public, and is well suited for human habitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost of repairs and alterations to his dwelling will be more than 50% of the listed value of his dwelling for taxation, and in consequence such repair and alterations are forbidden by the city code and the &quot;Remove and Demolish orders of the defendants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February 1964 he received a written notice dated 10 February 1964, from T. B. Lackey, Chief Housing Inspector for the city of Charlotte, entitled &quot;Findings of Fact and Order,&quot; containing the following, which we summarize: James R. Walker, owner of the dwelling located at 1449 South Church Street in the city of Charlotte, was duly served with complaint and notice in regard to the dwelling located at 1449 South Church Street in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the city of Charlotte, and pursuant thereto, a hearing was held on 7 February 1964.  As a result of the evidence presented at the hearing, it is found as a fact that the said dwelling is unfit for human habitation in violation of the city ordinance in the following respects, beyond reasonable repair.  The said dwelling cannot be repaired, altered or improved at a cost of less than 50% of the value of the dwelling.  Therefore, it is ordered that the owner before 18 March 1964 shall remove or demolish said building.  He alleges in his complaint that this order is based exclusively upon the provisions of Section 10A-8 of the Housing Code of the city of Charlotte, which ordinance the city of Charlotte was authorized to adopt by virtue of the provisions of G.S. 160-184.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 1964 he received a second written notice dated 24 March 1964 from T. B. Lackey, Chief Housing Inspector for the city of Charlotte, containing the following, which we summarize: A recent reinspection of the premises located at 1449 South Church Street in the city of Charlotte shows that nothing has been accomplished toward correcting the dangerous situation there existing, though prior to this date the owner Walker&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was notified by letter dated 12 April 1963 of the dangerous condition of this building.  The building is open and unoccupied, and is dangerous to the health or lives of the general public and persons passing near or living in the vicinity.  The building presents a hazard to children who may play in and around it, and endangers the security of the adjoining property by being open to vagrants.  Under the provisions of G.S. 160-151, the Charlotte Charter, Ch. 31(17), and the code of the city of Charlotte, Section 5-6(e), this building is declared unsafe and is condemned, and shall be removed within 30 days from the date of this letter.  If this work is not accomplished within the specified time, they have no other alternative but to prosecute in accordance with the laws.  He alleges in his complaint the prosecution of him referred to in this letter was authorized by G.S. 160-152 after a condemnation of his dwelling pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 160-151.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to 10 February 1964 and 24 March 1964 defendants posted a notice on his dwelling, which reads as follows: &quot;This building is unfit for human habitation; the use or occupation of this building for human habitation is prohibited&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and unlawful.&quot; He is in violation of the two &quot;remove or demolish&quot; orders served on him in that he wilfully refused, and still refuses, to demolish or remove his dwelling as directed by defendants, and that his intention is to return to work in order to make necessary repairs and alterations to bring his dwelling up to his personal standards, and that &quot;all of the defendants' orders and criminal codes&quot; prohibiting him from performing his right to repair, use, occupy, and enjoy his property is in violation of his rights under the Federal and State Constitutions.  Unless defendants are permanently restrained from preventing him from repairing his homestead to his needs, he will be further prosecuted under the criminal laws by the defendants, because G.S. 160-152 provides a fine for each day an unsafe building is allowed to stand after notice as set forth in the statute, he will lose his homestead, he will be unable to further his education as a minister and to earn his living while practicing law in an office in his homestead and living in his homestead, and that his health will be impaired, his constitutional rights and his liberty will be curtailed and abridged, and he will suffer irreparable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  injury.  That the statutes of the State of North Carolina and the ordinances of the city of Charlotte above referred to are unconstitutional as contrary to the provisions of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and as contrary to the provisions of Sections 1, 15, 17, 19, 29, 35, and 37 of Article I, and Section 1 of Article II, and Section 2 of Article X of the North Carolina Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">W. H. Jamison, Superintendent of Building Inspection of the city of Charlotte, swore out a warrant against him charging him on 23 June 1964 with unlawfully and wilfully violating Section 5-4(c) of the code of the city of Charlotte by renovating or repairing his residence located at 1449 South Church Street without first making application and obtaining a written permit therefor from the building inspection department of the city of Charlotte, all in violation of G.S. 14-4.  On 9 July 1964 he was convicted and given a 30-day jail sentence.  The complaint does not allege whether he appealed or served the sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Clark, without finding any facts, (1) restrained the defendants from demolishing the building located at 1449 South Church Street in the city of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Charlotte until the final determination of this action; and (2) refused to issue a temporary restraining order against enforcement of the provisions of the building code of the city of Charlotte, including Sections 5-4(c) and 5-6(e) thereof, and declined to vacate the orders of 10 February and 24 March 1964, as requested by the plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff homeowner appealed a judgment of a Mecklenburg county trial court (North Carolina), which restrained defendants, the city, its superintendent of building inspection, and its chief housing inspector, from demolishing the homeowner's home but refused to issue a temporary restraining order against enforcement of the provisions of Charlotte, N.C., Bldg. Code &sect;&sect; 5-4(c) and 5-6(e).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The homeowner vacated his home in order to make alterations and repairs to meet his personal needs, and while it was vacant, its porch, windows, and doors were extensively damaged by vandals. The house was otherwise in sound condition, was free from all dangers to the public, and was well suited for human habitation. Because the cost of repairs and alterations to the dwelling would be more than 50 percent of the listed value of the dwelling for taxation, the repairs and alterations were forbidden by city code. The homeowner received a notice from the chief housing inspector stating that the owner was required to remove or demolish the building. When he failed to obey this order, the homeowner was criminally prosecuted, and he received a jail sentence. The court held that the homeowner had totally failed to allege or to show facts as to how his health would be impaired if a temporary injunction as requested by him was not granted. In addition, he had failed to show that his property rights would suffer irreparable injury which was great and immediate if a temporary injunction as prayed for by him was not granted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, corporation or association and same are hereby prohibited from operation between the hours of 2:00 o'clock a.m., on Sunday and 12:00 o'clock midnight Sunday, any club where persons may associate for a common purpose, which club is located within 300 yards of the property on which is located any public school or church building, and at any such club all music shall cease at 1:00 o'clock a.m. on Sunday and same shall not be resumed until after 12:00 o'clock midnight on Sunday; that this regulation shall be applicable in all portions of Forsyth&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  County not embraced within the jurisdiction of the City of Winston-Salem and the Town of Kernersville.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(The cited statutes provide that &quot;an appropriate resolution&quot; adopted by the Board of Commissioners of Forsyth County in accordance with prescribed procedures shall have the effect of a &quot;legislative enactment,&quot; and that any person who violates such resolution shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to punishment by fine &quot;not exceeding fifty dollars ($ 50.00)&quot; or by imprisonment &quot;not exceeding thirty (30) days.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff owns and operates a night club in Forsyth County.  He operates it as a business enterprise for gain or profit.  It is located &quot;within three hundred (300) yards of a church building in Forsyth County.&quot; It is &quot;some miles removed from the center of Winston-Salem.&quot; He operates it &quot;one night per week, to wit, during the hours of Saturday evening and early Sunday morning, and, before the passage of said resolution . . ., operated until 3:00 a.m. Sunday morning.&quot; A part of its operation &quot;involves the playing of music for those patrons who desire to dance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the adoption of said resolution, plaintiff has been arrested twice, once because &quot;he had not closed his&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  place of business by 2:00 a.m.,&quot; and later because &quot;music was played in his establishment after 1:00 a.m.&quot; Plaintiff was convicted in the Municipal Court of Winston-Salem on May 8, 1964, &quot;for a violation&quot; of said resolution.  He appealed &quot;to the May 18, 1964, term of the Superior Court of Forsyth County, and said appeal is presently pending in the Forsyth County Superior Court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The plaintiff has some servants and employees who are paid wages for their work and labor from the proceeds derived from the operation of his club to the hour of 3:00 a.m. each Sunday morning.  Most of the plaintiff's patrons are colored persons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff seeks to enjoin the enforcement of said resolution.  He attacks said resolution on the ground the statutory provisions relied on as authority therefor are unconstitutional and therefore void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court, being of opinion plaintiff's &quot;proper remedy is in the criminal action which is pending against him and not by separate action on the civil side,&quot; vacated the temporary restraining order and dismissed the action.  Plaintiff excepted and appealed.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a civil action to foreclose tax liens upon real estate and to sell the real estate for taxes due the County of Iredell and the City of Statesville as authorized by G.S. 105-414.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action was instituted on 30 June 1962 and the complaint was filed on said date, and the summons, together with a copy of the complaint, was served on defendant Walker on 12 July 1962.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The taxes in default, as set out in the complaint, due the County of Iredell, were for taxes levied for the years 1945 through 1955 and for the year 1961.  The taxes in default due the City of Statesville, as set out in the complaint, were for taxes levied for the years 1937 through 1955.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Walker filed answer on 17 December 1962, and at no time has said defendant pleaded the ten-year statute of limitations as a bar to the relief sought, or any part thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 14 October 1963, the appellant filed a motion in bar to said action in which he sought to have the action abated as to all taxes levied prior to 29 June 1952.  Thereafter, on 2 December 1963, the appellant filed a supplemental motion to bar the action&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the ground that G.S. 105-422 is void and unconstitutional as being in conflict with Article II, Section 29 of the Constitution of North Carolina, which prohibits the passing of &quot;any local, private, or special act * * * extending the time for the assessment or collection of taxes * * *.&quot; These motions were heard by the Presiding Judge at the December Session 1962 of the Superior Court of Iredell County and were denied.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears from the record that when this cause came on for hearing at the March Session 1964 of the Superior Court of Iredell County, &quot;defendant, James R.

He also filed a supplemental motion to bar the action on the ground that the statute authorizing appellees' action was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the motions and entered a judgment for appellees. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that it did not pass upon constitutional questions unless they were squarely presented. The court held that the statute of limitations was not available as a defense or bar to an action unless pleaded and could not be raised by motion to dismiss. The court further held that in view of the taxpayer's failure to plead the statute of limitations in his answer or to attack in his answer the provisions of the allegedly unconstitutional statute, the constitutional question had not been properly presented.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs seek by this action to compel Swain County to provide by taxation, or otherwise, funds necessary to defray its part of the Old Age Assistance, Aid to Dependent Children, Aid to the Totally and Permanently Disabled, and Medical Assistance programs for the citizens of that County as required by Article 3, Chapter 108 of the General Statutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, in its answer, says the County &quot;stands ready and willing to impose and collect all taxes required by law to be collected from its taxpaying citizens, but defendant is advised and believes that it is illegal and unconstitutional for it to impose and collect taxes from its taxpaying citizens to provide welfare programs for citizens who are specifically exempt from taxation, and whose only claim to the benefit of tax funds from Swain County is that of geographical proximity.&quot; This assertion of non-liability is based on allegations that members of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians who live on the Cherokee Indian Reservation in Swain County &quot;do not pay any taxes whatever to the County of Swain and are non-taxable citizens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swain County's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  portion of the welfare funds to be expended in the current year for the benefit of Indians residing on the Reservation amounts to $ 10,894.24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge McLean, being of the opinion that Swain County could not be required to contribute to funds to be expended for the benefit of those residing on the Reservation, refused to require Swain County to make the payment.  Plaintiffs excepted and appealed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff taxpayers sought review of the decision of the trial court (North Carolina), which entered judgment in favor of defendant, Commissioners of a County, in the action brought by the taxpayers to compel the County to provide funds necessary to defray its part of the Old Age Assistance, Aid to Dependent Children, Aid to the Totally and Permanently Disabled, and Medical Assistance programs for the citizens of that County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The controversy arose because the County was significantly comprised of a Native American reservation. The taxpayers brought the action to compel the County to pay its portion of funds to the State for its public welfare programs. The Commissioners contended that it could not impose and collect taxes from its taxpaying citizens to provide welfare programs for citizens who were specifically exempt from taxation. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's judgment was improper. The court rejected the Commissioner's argument that the Native Americans were part of a foreign nation and, for that reason, were not entitled to the benefit and protection of the laws of the State. The court stated that there was no statutory provision that impaired the rights of the Native Americans to the benefits created by the joint action of the State and Federal Governments. The court found that the legislature had the power to impose matching obligations on the County. The court concluded that the mere fact that some citizens of the County, who received welfare funds, resided on property that was exempt from taxation did relieve the County of the burden imposed by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action to restrain the defendants from proceeding with the execution of the Redevelopment Plan for the East Central Urban Renewal Area Project No. N. C. R-23, unless or until the voters of the City of High Point shall approve the expenditure of the funds required to be contributed by the City of High Point in connection with the execution and completion of the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The individual and corporate plaintiffs are all taxpayers of the City of High Point; some of them own real property in the city, and at least one of the individual plaintiffs owns real property within the proposed redevelopment area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants are the Redevelopment Commission of the City of High Point (including the members of the Commission) and the City of High Point (including the Mayor and members of the City Council).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Summarizing the plaintiffs' complaint, they allege the creation of the Redevelopment Commission, preparation of a Redevelopment Plan for the East Central Urban Renewal Area, and the approval and adoption of the plan by the City Council of the City of High Point.  These allegations&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are admitted.  Plaintiffs further allege:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) That the Redevelopment Commission does not now have, and did not have when the City Council approved the project, a lawful plan for financing the project as required by G.S. 160-463(d) (7);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) that the Commission has no feasible plan for the relocation of displaced families as required by G.S. 160-463(d) (9);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) that the project is too broad in scope to qualify as slum clearance or blighted area under General Statutes 160, Article 37;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) that ad valorem tax money has been and will be spent, that taxes must be levied and bonds issued, debts contracted, faith pledged and credit loaned to finance the project, which is not a necessary expense within the meaning of Article VII, Section 7 (as amended, Article VII, Section 6) of the Constitution of North Carolina, and that no vote of the people has been held to approve such expenditures;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(5) that G.S. 160-470 is unconstitutional in that it allows the City of High Point to levy taxes and issue bonds for a non-necessary purpose without a vote of the people;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(6) that G.S. 160-466(d) is unconstitutional in that it authorizes the Commission to issue bonds without a vote of the people, and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in that it is an unlawful delegation of authority by the General Assembly to the Redevelopment Commission in violation of Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution of North Carolina; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(7) that plaintiffs have suffered and will suffer irreparable damage to their constitutional and property rights, and are adversely and directly affected by the Urban Redevelopment Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs seek:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) A permanent injunction against carrying out Project No. N.C. R-23;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) a declaration that G.S. 160-470 and G.S. 160-466(d) are unconstitutional; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) a permanent injunction against contracting any debt by which the faith and credit of the City of High Point is pledged or the levying and collection of taxes to be used for any purpose in connection with this project, except necessary expenses, without a vote of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court below heard the evidence and found the facts without a jury.  From the facts found and conclusions of law drawn therefrom, the court rendered the following judgment:</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The taxpayers objected to the expenditure of funds for an urban redevelopment plan. They sought injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment. On appeal, the court restrained the defendants from any expenditure or pledging of credit on account of the plan, remanded the case for further proceedings, and vacated the part of the lower court judgment that was in conflict with the opinion of the court. The court determined that there were several deficiencies in the evidence. For example, there was a lack of evidence in the record to determine where the funds would come from to procure the land to be donated by the city and to indicate compliance with the prerequisites for a determination of the necessity of off-street parking. The court found that the taxpayers deserved to be heard. The court rejected each challenge to the constitutionality of the statutes, but found that the redevelopment plan must specify the method of financing. Other bases for challenge by the taxpayers were deemed waived because they were not properly briefed, they were not properly set forth by separate assignment of error, or they were not preserved in the lower court by exception.</SPAN></P>

Aycock, Chancellor of the University of North Carolina, protesting her innocence, and requesting a review of her case to the end that a mistake of the Honor Council&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be corrected.  On 29 May 1961 Dr. Aycock wrote her a letter stating in substance that her appeal for a review had been denied, which meant he could find no reason to place her case in the hands of the Faculty Committee for a new hearing; and that since there is some indication she desired to pursue the matter further, an appeal from his decision not to grant another hearing should be made to his superior, Dr. William C. Friday, President of the University of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner appealed from Dr. Aycock's decision to Dr. William C. Friday, President of the University of North Carolina.  Dr. Friday affirmed Dr. Aycock's decision, on the ground that upon a review of petitioner's appeal he saw no denial of due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner then appealed to the Executive Committee of respondent from Dr. Friday's decision.  On 10 July 1961 the Executive Committee affirmed the decision of the Honor Council, the decision of Dr. Aycock, and the decision of Dr. Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the decision of the Executive Committee, petitioner appealed to respondent's full Board meeting on 26 February 1962.  At this meeting respondent's full Board passed a resolution appointing a Special Committee of the Board&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Trustees and directing it &quot;to make a thorough investigation of this entire matter and hear all interested parties and make its report and recommendations to the full Board of Trustees at its next meeting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report of the Special Committee to respondent's full Board appears in the record on pages 71 through 82, both inclusive.  This report shows that the Special Committee conceived its duty was to examine the procedures and machinery in disciplinary matters at the University of North Carolina, and to determine whether or not procedure had been followed in petitioner's case which insured her a fair hearing and due process in arriving at the determination that petitioner was guilty of the offense with which she was charged.  The Special Committee, after stating in substance in its report that there had been no denial of due process or fairness in the handling of petitioner's case, used this language:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;We feel, therefore, after making a full and complete investigation of this matter and hearing all interested parties, that the Board of Trustees should take no action; that the question of the readmission of Miss Carter to the University at Chapel Hill should be left where it&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  has been placed by the Trustees and where it properly belongs -- with the Chancellor and faculty at Chapel Hill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 28 May 1962 respondent's full Board adopted the report of its Special Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 2 June 1962 petitioner filed with the clerk of the superior court of Orange County an application for a writ of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  On 7 June 1962 petitioner filed with the clerk of the superior court of Wake County a petition for Judicial Review of a Final Administrative Decision of the Board of Trustees of the University of North Carolina, pursuant to Article 33, Chapter 143, of the General Statutes of North Carolina.  Respondent filed an answer to petitioner's application and petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By consent of petitioner's counsel and of respondent's counsel, the Attorney General of North Carolina, petitioner's application for a writ of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and her petition for Judicial Review were consolidated for hearing before Judge Heman R. Clark, presiding over 17 September 1962 Term of Wake County superior court.  On 21 September 1962 Judge Clark entered an order stating in effect that he had jurisdiction to review the decision of respondent's Board as petitioned for, and that he should&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  order further hearings of evidence to properly review the proceedings.  Whereupon, he ordered that the hearing be continued to 5 November 1962 in the Wake County superior court.  To this order no exception was noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hearing set for 5 November 1962 was continued to 15 November 1962.  Judge Clark had a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hearing.  He heard the testimony of Dr. William B. Aycock; the sworn testimony of John S. Catlin, an instructor in Latin at the University of North Carolina, who gave petitioner the make-up quiz and made the accusation against her; the testimony of Dr. Albert I. Suskin, head of the Latin Department of the University of North Carolina; the testimony of petitioner; and the unsworn testimony of Priscilla Wyrick, Chairman of the Women's Honor Council of the University of North Carolina, and of Tony Thompson, clerk, who wrote up the trial of the Honor Council.  Counsel for petitioner was present and participated in the hearing, as well as Ralph Moody, a Deputy Attorney General of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Clark entered an order in the hearing on 28 December 1962.  His order states near its beginning &quot;that petitioner challenged the legality of the decision of the Board on two&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  grounds:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(1) That the Trustees could not lawfully delegate final authority in matters of suspension of students properly enrolled in the University and therefore recognition of suspension of a student council is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(2) That in this case there was no competent, material and substantial evidence to support a finding that the petitioner was guilty of the charge of cheating, and therefore the Board of Trustees acted arbitrarily in approving the decision of the council suspending her from the University on these grounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Clark in his order, after stating the legal powers vested in respondent's Board of Trustees, and the amendment made to the Code of the University on 15 April 1957, which is set forth in full above, concluded &quot;that the petitioner's contention that the decision of the Board was an unconstitutional delegation of authority is without merit in her case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Judge Clark in his order, after reviewing the evidence given before him, concluded &quot;that all of the evidence offered against Miss Carter fails to rebut the presumption of innocence.  * * * To deny her readmission solely on grounds of the suspension for cheating on the evidence in this case&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  would, in the opinion of this Court, be arbitrary and capricious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then his order concludes as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Following the hearing in this Court, the Chancellor, through the Assistant Attorney General representing the Trustees, suggested that this case be remanded for further consideration in view of the evidence not known on review.  This procedure appears entirely appropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;NOW, THEREFORE, this cause is remanded to the Board of Trustees of the University of North Carolina and the Board is directed to refer the matter to the proper administrative authority for a review of the proceeding, including the additional evidence disclosed in this Court and for such other and further administrative action as is appropriate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No exception was taken by any party to this order, and no appeal by any party from this order was made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 3 June 1963 petitioner made a motion before Judge Clawson L. Williams, presiding over Wake County superior court, that an order be issued to the Board of Trustees of the University of North Carolina to show cause why the record in this proceeding should not be returned to the court, and an order issued, pursuant to G.S. 143-315, reversing the Women's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Honor Council and the suspension of petitioner from the University, and directing the correction of the University records accordingly, and that such other appropriate action should be taken by the court in the premises.  On the same date Judge Williams issued an order for the Board of Trustees of the University of North Carolina to appear before him in the Wake County superior court on 18 June 1963, and show cause, if any it has, why petitioner's motion, which is set forth in the show cause order, should not be allowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 14 June 1963 the parties in this proceeding entered a stipulation to the effect that the hearing of the show cause order should be continued to 27 June 1963, and in the event that the matter could not be heard by Judge Williams on that date, then it may be heard by Judge Williams, in or out of chambers, out of term, out of the county and out of the district, at such place and time as it may be heard by Judge Williams and as agreed by the parties through their counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hearing was held by Judge Williams on 26 July 1963 in chambers at Sanford, North Carolina, when and where petitioner was represented by her counsel, and respondent was represented by Ralph Moody, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a Deputy Attorney General of North Carolina.  The hearing was on the record, motion, order to show cause, answer to motion, reply to the answer, and argument of counsel.  Judge Williams entered an order in the hearing on 1 November 1963, which was filed on 18 November 1963.  Judge Williams' order, after reciting that part of Judge Clark's order of 28 December 1962 wherein it is stated &quot;this cause is remanded to the Board of Trustees of the University of North Carolina and the Board is directed to refer the matter to the proper administrative authority for a review of the proceeding, including the additional evidence disclosed in this Court and for such other and further administrative action as is appropriate,&quot; goes on to state:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;* * * pursuant to said order of Judge Clark the Board of Trustees of the University of North Carolina by resolution referred this proceeding to the Chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for appropriate action and said Chancellor referred this proceeding to the Faculty Committee on Student Discipline for the purpose of carrying out the order of Judge Clark; that the Chairman of the Faculty Committee on Student Discipline, Professor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  James R. Caldwell, notified the petitioner on May 29, 1963, that said Committee would hold a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c43">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> hearing in this matter and that additional evidence would be taken in the proceeding with other information as to the membership of the said Committee and the status of counsel * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After these recitals Judge Williams' order decrees as follows, in substance:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One.  The suspension of petitioner from the University by the Honor Council is stayed, unless and until the same shall be restored upon the final termination of this proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two.  This entire matter shall be heard </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the Faculty Committee on Student Discipline of the University, which shall make findings of fact and conclusions as to whether petitioner's suspension from the University should be sustained, or whether her suspension is not supported by substantial evidence or for other valid reasons should be vacated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three.  In the conduct of the hearing by the Faculty Committee on Student Discipline, it shall use, review and incorporate in its hearing the entire record in the hearing before Judge Clark.  In addition, it shall hear all other relevant evidence offered by petitioner and respondent.  Petitioner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and respondent shall be entitled to counsel, and petitioner shall have the right to subpoena and cross-examine any witnesses that have heretofore testified in this proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four.  No member of the student body and no designated officers of Student Government of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill shall sit with or as members of the Faculty Committee on Student Discipline during the hearing.  The Faculty Committee on Student Discipline in the conduct of the hearing shall not be limited by the technical rules of a court of law, but the hearing shall be conducted in a manner to protect basic constitutional rights of petitioner under the laws and constitution of Student Government and according to basic principles of due process of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five.  The Faculty Committee on Student Discipline shall make a full report and record of its hearing, its findings of fact, its conclusions and determination, and file it in the office of the clerk of the superior court of Wake County for such other and further proceedings as may be deemed appropriate by the court and in accordance with law.  Within 30 days after the filing of the report, either party may file objections and exceptions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six.  Until petitioner exhausts the available hearing before the Faculty Committee on Student Discipline, the court holds as a matter of law that petitioner has not exhausted her administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven.  Petitioner's motion and order to show cause heretofore issued in this proceeding is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From this order of Judge Williams, petitioner appeals to the Supreme Court.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs, who are residents, property owners, and taxpayers of the Town of Mount Airy and County of Surry, instituted this civil action to restrain the Town and County from appropriating and expending public funds of the Town and County in constructing and maintaining an airport outside the Town of Mount Airy, Surry County.  The Mount Airy-Surry County Airport Authority was made a party defendant.  Judge Johnston, upon application of the plaintiffs, issued a temporary restraining order pending hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff taxpayers appealed a judgment from the Civil Session of Surry County Superior Court (North Carolina), which modified a temporary restraining order against defendants, a town, a county, and the Town of Mount Airy-Surry County Airport Commission. The judgment modified the temporary restraining order to permit the city and the county to expend public funds pursuant to the contract that established the Commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The county and the town entered into a written contract that established the Commission. The taxpayers filed an action in which they sought to restrain the county and the town from appropriating and expending public funds for the construction and maintenance of an airport. A temporary restraining order was issued, but the taxpayers appealed after the trial court modified the order to permit the expenditures with some limitations. The court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court found that the contract violated N.C. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6 because it pledged the faith and credit of the town and the county without a vote. The obligations of the town and the county to underwrite costs of the airport's operation were unlimited either as to time, amount, or source of funds. The court concluded that the officials of the town and the county did not have authority either to use tax money or to incur a debt in furtherance of the project because the proposed appropriation was for an unnecessary public purpose. The court determined that the county could not treat intangibles tax receipts as surplus funds and that the town did not have surplus water and sewer revenues on hand.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action to enjoin the Board of Commissioners of Scotland County from issuing bonds, the proceeds from which are to be used for school construction, and from proceeding with the merger of the Laurinburg City School Administrative Unit and the Scotland County School Administrative Unit under the provisions of Chapter 707, 1963 Session Laws of North Carolina and Chapter 115 of the General Statutes of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Act in question provides for a merger of the above named administrative units if approved by a majority of the voters of Scotland County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The essential parts of the plan as adopted and approved by a majority of the duly qualified voters of Scotland County, are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) The issuance of school building bonds in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding $ 1,750,000 for the purpose of building a new consolidated high school, remodeling, enlarging and reconstructing existing school buildings and other school plant facilities, and to acquire the necessary land and equipment therefor, in order to provide the additional school facilities in the County of Scotland to maintain&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the six months' school term in said county as required by Section 3 of Article IX of the Constitution of North Carolina, and the levy and collection of a sufficient tax for the payment of the principal of and interest on said bonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) The merger of the Laurinburg City School Administrative Unit and the Scotland County School Administrative Unit and their respective Boards of Education.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) To require the Laurinburg-Scotland County Board of Education to request and the Scotland County Board of Commissioners &quot;to appropriate annually from any local sources, including both general and supplemental tax revenues, such funds as will provide, at a minimum, current expense expenditures per student from local funds which shall be no less than the average current expense expenditures per student from local funds throughout the State, as determined by the latest certification of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) To authorize the County Commissioners to levy a countywide supplemental school tax not to exceed fifty cents (50 cents) per one hundred dollar valuation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Act also provides for the details of the school merger, such as terms of office of Board members, election procedure, administrative personnel, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et cetera</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which the General Statutes do not provide for in detail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 707, 1963 Session Laws, the Scotland County electorate, on 3 March 1964, approved the merger of the City and County Administrative School Units, the issuance of the bonds to finance said construction, and authorized the levy and collection of a tax sufficient to pay the principal of and the interest on said bonds.  The voters likewise approved the levy of the minimum tax as set forth in paragraph three above, as well as the supplemental tax of fifty cents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, on 19 March 1964, the Laurinburg Board of Education petitioned the Scotland County Board of Education and the State Board of Education requesting the merger of the City and County Administrative School Units; and on 20 March 1964 the said petition was approved by the Scotland County Board of Education and by the State Board of Education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action was instituted on 20 March 1964 and, by consent of all parties, the matter was heard on 6 April 1964 before the Honorable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Henry A.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant taxpayer sought review of a judgment from the trial court (North Carolina), which refused enjoin appellee board of county commissioners from issuing bonds, the proceeds from which were to be used for school construction, and from proceeding with the merger of a city's school administrative unit and appellee county's school administrative unit under the provisions of 1963 N.C.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">1963 N.C. Sess. Laws 707 provided for a merger of the city's school administrative unit and the county's school administrative unit if approved by the county's voters. After the merger's approval, the taxpayer filed an action against the county and the board, seeking to enjoin the board from issuing bonds, the proceeds from which were to be used for school construction, and from proceeding with the merger. Following an unfavorable verdict, the taxpayer sought review. Upon review, the court held that 1963 N.C. Sess. Laws 707 did not establish or change the lines of school districts in violation of N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 29. The court held that the constitutional prohibition was against the general assembly's direct action and not against the establishment of machinery for the accomplishment of such ends. Moreover, the court rejected the contention that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115-93 unlawfully delegated discretionary power to the Superintendent of Public Instruction in connection with the average current expense expenditures per student. Finally, the court held that 1959 N.C. Sess. Laws 1220 authorized the board to issue bonds in excess of the limit fixed by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 153-87.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 26, 1963 each of the three defendants was convicted in the Fayetteville City Recorder's Court upon a warrant which charged that on June 11, 1963 he &quot;unlawfully and willfully and intentionally did go and enter upon the lands of the North Carolina Theatre, Inc., Colony Theatre without a license therefor, and did willfully and unlawfully remain on said premises after being asked to leave the Colony Theatre by the said E.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendants, who were black, were convicted of unlawfully and willfully and intentionally entering upon the lands of a theater without a license and willfully and unlawfully remaining on said premises after being asked to leave by the manager, in violation of &sect; 14-134. On appeal, the court found no error. The court held that there was no evidence that defendants entered the orchestra section of the theater under a bona fide belief that they had a legal right to do so. The theater tickets were obtained by subterfuge for the purpose of creating a situation, which resulted in the arrests of defendants. Thus, they could not claim the right to enter and remain in the theater after being forbidden so to do upon any status as ticket holders. A proprietor of a private business had the right to select the clientele he was to serve and he could exclude from his premises any individual on the basis of sex, color, creed, or caprice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action grows out of a collision of two tractor-trailers.  The collision occurred February 21, 1962, in Lee County, North Carolina, on U. S. Highway No. 1.  One tractor-trailer (southbound) was operated by plaintiff.  The other (northbound) was operated by Clarence Willis Goggans, referred to hereafter as Goggans.  The collision caused plaintiff's injury and Goggans' death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 13, 1962, plaintiff instituted this action against the corporate defendants to recover damages for personal injuries.  He alleged, in substance, that the collision and his injuries were proximately caused by the negligence of Goggans and that Goggans was operating the northbound tractor-trailer as agent for the corporate defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goggans died intestate on or about February 21, 1962, in Lee County.  He was a resident of Lamar County, Georgia.  On May 6, 1963, in Lamar County, Georgia, Willis S. Goggans, referred to hereafter as appellant, was duly appointed and qualified as administrator of the estate of Goggans and is now acting in that capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At May Session, 1963, an order was entered making&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appellant a party defendant and allowing plaintiff to file an amended complaint.  Plaintiff filed amended complaint and caused summons for appellant to be issued to the Sheriff of Wake County.  This summons and the amended complaint were served on the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, who forwarded them to appellant, all in strict compliance with the procedural requirements of G.S. 1-105.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 17, 1963, appellant moved that the court &quot;dismiss the amended complaint or in lieu thereof . . . quash the return of service of summons . . .&quot; The court, being of opinion &quot;that the 1953 Amendment to G.S. 1-105 subjects non-resident personal representatives of non-resident motorists to suit in North Carolina in actions arising out of the operation by non-resident motorists, since deceased, of automobiles upon the highways of this State and to service of process in such actions as provided in G.S. 1-105,&quot; held that &quot;the defendant administrator&quot; had been properly served with summons in this action and had the legal capacity to be sued herein and denied appellant's motion.

The court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-105 (1953) authorized plaintiff's action against the administrator and service of process in the manner prescribed therein. The court held that &sect; 1-105 provided for service upon the administrators of deceased nonresident drivers.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 18, 1963 petitioner filed with the North Carolina Veterans Commission an application for a scholarship under Article 15, Chapter 116 of the General Statutes of North Carolina.  At the same time she applied for admission to the University of North Carolina School of Nursing.  Petitioner was born in Portland, Maine, on September 15, 1946.  She has lived in North Carolina continuously since June 1, 1951 when she and her parents came to this State for the first time.  Her father, Earle Gene Ramsey, is a one-hundred percent disabled World War II veteran receiving compensation from the Veterans Administration for service-connected injuries.  Mr. Ramsey was a legal resident of the State of Indiana at the time he entered the armed forces on January 17, 1941.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission denied petitioner's application on October 19, 1963 because she was not an &quot;eligible child&quot; as defined by G.S. 116-149(b).

The veterans commission denied the application on the ground that the veteran's child was not an eligible child as defined by &sect; 116-149(b). The veteran's child appealed, and the trial court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected the argument the veteran's child made that the statute violated N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 and the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution by classifying children of veterans who were residents of the state when they entered the armed forces as eligible, and classifying children of veterans who later moved to the state as ineligible. The court held that statutes were presumed constitutional and would be upheld if supported by any reasonable ground. The court concluded that the statute's distinction was prima facie reasonable because no state could be expected to incur the expense of educating all children of veterans who might, at some time after discharge from service, become a resident of the state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant was tried upon a bill of indictment charging her with a violation of the provisions of G.S. 14-134, in that she unlawfully trespassed upon the premises of the Plantation Restaurant at Enfield, North Carolina.  The restaurant is owned and operated by William R. Davis, the prosecuting witness, who also owns the Enfield Motel located about 50 feet north of the restaurant on the same side of Highway 301.  The restaurant serves white people only and has a sign to that effect at the entrance thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show that the Plantation Restaurant is located about 65 feet from Highway 301 within the town limits of Enfield; that on the night of 6 August 1963 the defendant and other Negroes, approximately 35 in number, forced their way into the Plantation Restaurant through the back door and took seats at tables where white customers were being served.  That around noon on 7 August 1963 the defendant, accompanied by approximately 35 other Negroes, approached the front entrance of the Plantation Restaurant, and the owner of the restaurant locked the front door.  The defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sat down on the floor mat in front of the door.  The owner of the restaurant unlocked the front door and repeatedly requested the defendant and others to move away from the front door in order that his customers might enter the restaurant.  He also requested them to leave the premises.  Neither the defendant nor the other Negroes present paid any attention to the requests of the proprietor of the restaurant.  Officers were called, and the request to the defendant and the other Negroes to leave the premises of the restaurant was again made in the presence of the officers, and upon the failure of the defendant and others to unblock the entrance to the restaurant and leave the premises, the defendant and others were arrested and charged with trespass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence also tends to show that on this occasion the defendant never requested service at the restaurant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant moved for judgment as of nonsuit at the close of the State's evidence.  Motion denied.  The defendant offered no evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant argued that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-134 was unconstitutional because it was in conflict with N.C.

Defendant claimed that the prosecution rested upon an unlawful exercise of legislative power by a private citizen. Defendant claimed that she had the inherent right to exercise the fundamental freedom to enter upon the premises of any private business that was open to the public generally, whether she was forbidden to do so or not, and any abridgment of that right was unconstitutional. On review the court found no error. The court held that it was apparent that the legislature intended to prevent the unwanted invasion of the property rights of another. It was not the act of entering or going on the property that was condemned, it was the intent or manner in which the entry was made that made the conduct criminal. The court held that the provisions of &sect; 14-134 did not conflict with the federal or state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The petition to remove alleged that the interpretation that the trial court had placed on N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-134 rendered the statute unconstitutional as applied to defendants who were African Americans. Defendants filed the petition prior to their cases being called to trial. On appeal, the court held that the language of 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1446 was plain and required no interpretation. The court determined that removal from a state court to a federal district court was accomplished by filing a petition in the district court, giving notice to the adverse party, and filing a copy of the petition in the state court. Further, the court decided that the record showed that defendants did those things enumerated in the statute as necessary for removal to the federal district court. The court indicated that the trial court's jurisdiction terminated before defendants were tried. The court noted that if the cases had been improperly removed, the error could be corrected by motion in the federal district court. The court stated that if and when the federal district court remanded, the trial court could try defendants on the charges in the bills of indictment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action to enjoin defendants, who are in the retail grocery business, from selling milk below cost for the purpose of injuring, harassing or destroying competition with other retail grocers in violation of G.S. 106-266.21, heard upon a show cause order as to why an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ex parte</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> temporary restraining order should not be continued until the final hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the show cause hearing plaintiff offered in evidence one affidavit, that of Carl F. Bottoms, an employee of the North Carolina Milk Commission.  His affidavit is in substance as follows: On 13 March 1963, on 21 March 1963, on 3 May 1963, and on 6 June 1963 he visited the retail grocery store operated by defendants in Winston-Salem, and on each occasion found that half gallons of Sealtest milk were advertised for sale at 49c per half gallon plus sales tax.  On 3 May 1963 and on 6 June 1963 he purchased a one-half gallon container of Sealtest milk, Grade A, in their store for 49c plus sales tax.  He is familiar with the wholesale cost of one-half gallons of milk in Winston-Salem and knows that the actual cost thereof to defendants was 49c&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  per half gallon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants offered in evidence an affidavit by Curlee L. Dagenhardt, one of the defendants, which is in substance as follows: Retail grocerymen cannot handle milk at any sort of reasonable profit in competition with the wholesalers, whose retail service includes deliveries to refrigerators of consumers at 55c per half gallon.  For these defendants to sell milk at 49c per half gallon is not against the public interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants further introduced in evidence two affidavits by fourteen people engaged in the retail grocery business in the Winston-Salem area, which are </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ipsissimis verbis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and are in substance as follows: Every person engaged in the retail grocery business in the Winston-Salem area knows that when a retail grocer in that area sells milk at 49c per half gallon plus sales tax, it is not for the purpose of injuring, harassing, or destroying competition among people engaged in the retail grocery business.  The only persons adversely affected in any way by a retail grocer selling half gallons of milk for 49c plus sales tax are the wholesalers of milk who are dealing with the retail trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court in its order found facts substantially as follows: Defendants&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are engaged in the retail grocery business.  On 3 May 1963 and 6 June 1963 defendants in their store sold to the public half gallons of milk for the price of 49c per half gallon plus sales tax, which was below cost as that term is defined in G.S. 106-266.21.  Defendants' sale of milk at that price was for the purpose of injuring, harassing or destroying competition, to wit, with other retail grocers in Winston-Salem and its vicinity.  That unless restrained defendants will continue selling milk below cost as that term is defined in the statute, in violation of G.S. 106-266.21, and it is necessary in order to protect the public interest and to prevent further violations of G.S. 106-266.21 by defendants that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ex parte</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> restraining order heretofore issued be continued until the final hearing.  Whereupon, the court, based upon its findings of fact, entered an order continuing the restraining order until the final hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants excepted to the order and appeal.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant merchants challenged a decision from the Forsyth Civil Court (North Carolina), which issued a temporary injunction to prevent the merchants from selling milk below cost for the purpose of injuring, harassing, or destroying competition with other retail grocers in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 106-266.21. The merchants were ordered to show cause why an ex parte temporary restraining order should not be continued until the final hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">A North Carolina Milk Commission employee visited the merchants' store and bought below-cost milk, and a complaint was filed. The court found no evidence permitting a legitimate inference that the merchants sold milk below cost, as defined in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 106-266.21, to lure customers into their store in destructive competition with other retail grocers or that by such sales they diverted trade from a competitor in the retail grocery business. The court held that the evidence did not support the lower court's challenged finding of fact. The court found that the merchants rebutted the prima facie case created by the provisions of &sect;. 106-266.21. The court noted that the lower court's order continuing the ex parte injunction until the final hearing was improvidently entered and was vacated. The merchants contended that &sect; 106-266.21 was unconstitutional and sought to have it overruled, but the court declined, opining that the statute's constitutionality should not be decided on an interlocutory injunction, complaint, and affidavits, when no answer was filed, but should be determined at the final hearing when all the facts could be shown.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court reversed the temporary injunction issued by the lower court. There was no evidence that the merchants' below-cost milk sales were for the purpose of injuring, harassing, or destroying retail grocer competition in the vicinity.</SPAN></P>

J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 3 June 1963 Special &quot;A&quot; Civil Session of Mecklenburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action instituted on 4 October 1962 by plaintiffs as a class action to restrain permanently the defendants from enforcing the provisions of an ordinance of the city of Charlotte, and an amendment thereto, commonly known as the city Blue Law, on the ground that the ordinance, and the amendment thereto, violates the provisions of Article I, section 17, of the North Carolina Constitution, and of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 4 October 1962 Riddle, S. J., issued a temporary injunction restraining defendants from enforcing the provisions of this ordinance, and the amendment thereto.  On 23 October 1962 defendants demurred to the complaint on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.  On 25 October 1962 Riddle, S. J., overruled the demurrer and continued the temporary injunction to the final hearing.  We denied a petition for a writ of certiorari.  Thereafter, on 20 November 1962, defendants filed an answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action came on to be heard on its merits before Brock, S. J., at the 3 June 1963 Special &quot;A&quot; Civil&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Session.  Pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 1-184&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the parties waived a jury trial and agreed that the judge should hear the evidence, make findings of fact and conclusions of law, and render judgment thereon.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">FINDINGS OF FACT MADE BY JUDGE BROCK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;1. That the plaintiff, Clark's Charlotte, Inc., is a North Carolina corporation duly organized and existing with an office and place of business located in the City of Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, State of North Carolina, where it engages in, among other things, a general retail merchandising and mercantile business, including a restaurant, a department in the store which furnishes medical and surgical supplies, but which does not have a pharmacist and does not fill prescriptions or sell so-called ethical drugs, another department or departments which sell cookies, candies, chewing gum, beverages, tobacco products, books, newspapers, magazines, dairy products, bakery products (there being no bakery on the premises), shoe shine parlors, coin-operated vending machines, and sporting goods and games; that although Clark's Charlotte, Inc., does sell the items described above, it is a department store and the sale of soft goods&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  accounts for the major portion of its sales volume.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;2. That the plaintiff, Atlantic Mills of N. C., Inc., is a corporation duly organized and existing with a place of business in the City of Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, State of North Carolina, where it engages in a general retail merchandising and mercantile business, including a department which sells medical and surgical supplies, but which does not have a pharmacist, does not fill prescriptions and does not sell any of the so-called ethical drugs, a restaurant, cookies, candies, tobacco products, books, newspapers, games, and various coin operated vending machines; that although Atlantic Mills of N. C., Inc. does sell some of the above described items, it is a department store and the major portion of its sales volume comes from the sale of soft goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;3. That the term 'soft goods' means clothing of all sorts, towels, sheets, pillow cases, fabrics, and other products made from fabrics of various kinds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;4. That the plaintiff, Clark's, operates its place of business in a leased premises located within a shopping center and that all customers enter and leave Clark's through an exterior doorway, whereby the customers are required&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  to go by cashier counters and pay for all self service purchased located within the store area, except for bakery, restaurant, and vending machines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;5. The plaintiff, Atlantic Mills, engages in a general retail merchandising and mercantile business in a leased area with an exterior door for the entrance and exit of all customers and with a checkout counter operated by cashiers and that it is designated as a self-service department store, and all items purchased by the customers in the store area are required to be paid for at the check-out counters, except for restaurant and vending machines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;6. The defendant, J. Clyde Hunter, is the duly elected and acting Sheriff of Mecklenburg County.  The defendant, John Hord, is the duly appointed and acting Chief of Police of the Charlotte Police Department.  The defendant, G. A. Stephens, is the duly appointed and acting Chief of Police of the Mecklenburg County Rural Police Department.  That each of the officers in his official capacity intends to enforce the Ordinance as set forth in Paragraph 6 of the plaintiffs' Complaint, and, further, that said officers in their official capacity shall proceed against the plaintiffs and others similarly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  situated if it is made to appear that a violation of the City Ordinance has occurred.  The violation of the City Ordinance in question constitutes a general misdemeanor and each act in violation thereof constitutes a separate and distinct criminal violation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;7. That the Ordinance complained of is Section 13-56, as amended, of the Code of the City of Charlotte, and was enacted pursuant to the authority granted by G.S. 160-52, G.S. 160-200(6), (7) and (10) and Chapter 366 of the Public-Local Laws of 1939, as amended, and provides that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;'It shall be unlawful to conduct, operate or engage in or carry on within the City of Charlotte on Sunday any business except hotels; motels; boarding houses; restaurants; drug stores furnishing medical or surgical supplies, food-stuffs, beverages, tobacco products, books, newspapers and magazines only; food stores furnishing foodstuffs, beverages, tobacco products, books, newspapers and magazines only; newspapers and the sale thereof; public utilities; radio and television broadcasting; public and private hauling and the rental of vehicles therefor and the rental of automobiles; taxicabs; gasoline service stations; refrigeration; dairy products; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  bakeries; magazine stands; ice and the sale thereof; shoeshine parlors; coinoperated laundries and dry-cleaners; coin-operated vending machines; real estate dealers; funeral directors; cemeteries; florists; and amusements, shows, games, sports and sporting events; provided, however, that it shall be unlawful to operate, stage or put on any amusement, show, game, sport or sporting event, where a fee is charged for admission as a spectator, within the City of Charlotte, on Sunday prior to one o'clock p.m., eastern standard time, except that this section shall not apply to any amusement, show, game, sport or sporting event that is or may be in progress at Saturday midnight.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;8. That the effective date of Section 13-56, as amended, of the Code of the City of Charlotte was October 1, 1962.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;9. That the present action is a class action instituted by the plaintiffs and numerous other persons, firms, and corporations not named as parties hereto, but in whose behalf the present action has been instituted, do, along with these plaintiffs operate a general retailing merchandising and mercantile store in the City of Charlotte, and, further, that they and the plaintiffs above-named engage on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  Sundays in the business of selling articles both embraced and not embraced in the various categories referred to in the above said Ordinance and its amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;10. The plaintiff, Clark's does not compel any of its employees as a condition of employment to work on Sunday, and that the employment of employees on Sunday is of a voluntary nature.  That Clark's operates its business on Sunday between the hours of 1:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. Any employees of Clark's who volunteer to work the five hours on Sunday are then entitled to a full day off during the week and are paid for a full eight hours of work.  The Sunday afternoon business operation of Clark's constitutes approximately 15% of the total dollar volume of the corporation for the entire week, and that the Sunday sales constitute a large and substantial dollar volume of business.  That Clark's has applied for, paid for, and received various and sundry licenses from the City of Charlotte, State of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;11. That Atlantic Mills does question each prospective employee as to the willingness of the employee to work on Sunday, and if the employee accepts employment, the employee is expected to work on certain Sundays, but only&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  between the hours of 1:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m., and for which the employee receives a full day's pay and receives a day off during the week.  That the Sunday employment is on a rotated basis among the employees of the corporation.  In the corporation operation between 1:00 and 6:00 p.m. on Sunday, Atlantic Mills attributes 33% to 34% of its total weekly business to the Sunday afternoon operation during the three weeks prior to Christmas, and at times other than immediately prior to Christmas, the Sunday operation constitutes approximately 15% to 20% of the total volume of the business for the week.  During the three weeks before Christmas, 1962, it is estimated that approximately 63% of the customers at Atlantic Mills came to shop from places outside the City of Charlotte.  That the Sunday sales constitute a large and substantial dollar volume of business.  That Atlantic Mills has applied for, paid for, and received various and sundry licenses from the City of Charlotte, State of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;12. That both Clark's and Atlantic Mills operate from 9:30 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. on Monday through Saturday of each week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;13. That each of the plaintiffs above-named derive from their Sunday&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  sales a large and substantial dollar volume of business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;14. That in order to open any individual department or section of the plaintiffs' business, the plaintiffs' entire general business is also open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;15. That Section 13-56, as amended, of the Code of the City of Charlotte prohibits the operation of all department stores on Sunday and prohibits the operation of all general retail merchandising and mercantile stores in the City of Charlotte on Sunday; that under the provisions of the Ordinance, the plaintiffs would not be permitted to conduct, operate, engage in, or carry on their business on Sunday in the City of Charlotte.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW MADE BY JUDGE BROCK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, the court makes the following Conclusions of Law:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;1. That Section 13-56, as amended, of the Code of the City of Charlotte contains a general prohibition against operation of all businesses in the City of Charlotte on Sunday, but that there are excepted from such prohibition several specified classes of business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;2. That the operation of department stores or general retail merchandising and mercantile businesses are not among the classes of business excepted from the prohibition&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  of Section 13-56, as amended, of the Code of the City of Charlotte, and that the named plaintiffs and all others similarly situated are required by the Ordinance to close on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;3. That Section 13-56, as amended, of the Code of the City of Charlotte affects all persons engaged in the department store or general retail merchandising and mercantile business without discrimination, in that all businesses of this type, including the plaintiffs, are required to close on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;4. That Section 13-56, as amended, of the Code of the City of Charlotte is neither arbitrary, capricious, unconstitutionally vague, or violative of any constitutional rights of the plaintiffs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based upon his findings of fact and conclusions of law, Judge Brock ordered and decreed that the temporary restraining order theretofore issued be dissolved, and that the action be dismissed and plaintiffs be taxed with the costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereupon, the court, exercising the discretionary power conferred by G.S. 1-500, ordered that the temporary restraining order remain in effect pending disposition of plaintiffs' appeal to the Supreme Court, provided that the plaintiffs execute and deposit with the clerk a bond in the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sum of $ 5,000 to indemnify the defendants for any loss they may suffer on account of continuing said restraining order.  On 14 June 1963 the required bond was filed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the judgment entered, plaintiffs appeal to the Supreme Court.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant department store owners sought review of a judgment from the trial court (North Carolina), which upheld the constitutionality of a Sunday blue ordinance, which prohibited the opening of department store and the selling of soft goods on Sundays. The store owners filed the action against appellee police officials, asserting that the ordinance violated N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The ordinance prohibited the sale of soft goods on Sundays, with exception for drug stores, cigar stands and newsstands, and restaurants and sandwich shops. The department store owners asserted that the ordinance violated equal protection rights because it allowed those excepted businesses to sell items on Sundays that were also available at the department stores. The trial court held that the ordinance was not discriminatory, arbitrary, or unreasonable and the court agreed. The court held that Sunday blue laws were permissible and were based on a long-standing tradition. The court found that the operation of large department stores, the major portion of whose sales volume came from the sale of soft goods, although they sold many other goods was an entirely different business from drug stores furnishing medical or surgical supplies, foodstuffs, beverages, tobacco products, books, newspapers and magazines only; and from food stores. The court concluded that the classification was reasonable and justified and did not violate due process or equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court affirmed the decision that upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeals by W. C. Murchison and Louis A. Burney as guardians ad litem and by W. R. Kenan, Jr. and A. R. MacMannis as trustees from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Mintz, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, June 1963 Civil Session of New Hanover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Graham Kenan (hereafter Mrs. Kenan), a resident of New Hanover County was, in May 1962, found by a jury to be &quot;physically and mentally incompetent from want of understanding to manage her affairs by reason of physical and mental weakness on account of old age, disease or other like infirmities.&quot; Based on this finding the clerk of the Superior Court adjudged her incompetent and, as authorized by G.S. 35-2, appointed her nephew, Frank H. Kenan, as trustee &quot;to control and handle the person and entire estate of Sarah Graham Kenan wheresoever located.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 1963 the Legislature enacted three statutes, c. 111, 112, and 113, S. L. 1963, codified as G.S. 35-29.1 -- 29.4, 29.5 -- 29.10, and 29.11 -- 29.16.  These statutes authorize a guardian or trustee of an incompetent with the approval of the resident judge of the Superior Court to make gifts for religious, charitable, or educational purposes.  C. 111 permits gifts to be made from income, c. 112, from principal, and c. 113 permits the trustee&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to surrender the right to revoke a trust created by the incompetent and make a gift of the reserved life estate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May 1963 Frank H. Kenan as trustee of Mrs. Kenan filed three petitions with the clerk of the Superior Court.  In the first he sought authority to make gifts aggregating $ 731,600 from the income of his ward, in the second, a gift of $ 100,000 from the principal, and in the third, authority to surrender the right reserved by incompetent to revoke a trust created by her in 1956 and to donate to designated institutions the income reserved for her life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Summarized, the petitions allege: Mrs. Kenan is and was in 1962 a resident of New Hanover County.  She was there adjudged incompetent.  Petitioner was appointed as trustee of her person and estate.  It is improbable that she will hereafter have mental capacity to manage her affairs.  She is a widow.  She has no descendants and will never have any.  Her estate, worth many millions, consists in part of a revocable inter vivos trust created by her in December 1956.  Her annual income for the past five years has substantially exceeded $ 2,000,000.  Her federal taxable income for 1963 is estimated to exceed $ 2,800,000.  Her&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  federal and state income taxes for 1963 are not expected to exceed $ 2,000,000.  Expenditures for her maintenance in the five years preceding 1962 averaged $ 31,000.  They were $ 35,500 for the year 1962, and are expected to amount to that sum in 1963.  After the payment of all taxes and other expenses of the incompetent and the making of the gifts as proposed, the remaining income would be adequate to maintain Mrs. Kenan in the manner she is accustomed to and in excess of twice the sums expended annually for her maintenance for the preceding five years.  The bulk of Mrs. Kenan's estate consists of stocks and bonds deposited for safekeeping in New York.  She owns her home in Wilmington and other tangible property located in North Carolina.  She has bank accounts in North Carolina and New York.  On the same day in 1955 she executed two related testamentary writings.  One, designated her North Carolina will, disposes of property located here; the other, designated her New York will, disposes of property located in that state.  Each of the proposed donees meets the requirement of the particular statute under which petitioner seeks authority to act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gifts proposed to be made from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  income total $ 731,600, from principal, $ 100,000, and from the surrender of incompetent's right to receive the income from the 1956 trust created by her, approximately $ 300,000 per annum for her life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition seeking authority to make gifts from income contains allegations in the language of G.S. 35-29.2(1); the petition seeking authority to make a gift from principal contains allegations in the language of G.S. 35-29.6(1).  The proceeding to surrender the right to revoke the inter vivos trust and make a gift of Mrs. Kenan's right to receive the income for her life not only seeks to make a gift to tax-exempt beneficiaries but would impose a tax liability on Mrs. Kenan's estate.  Petitioner, in that proceeding, alleged:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(A) That all gift taxes which will be incurred by reason of the making of said trust irrevocable and the making a gift of the lifetime interest to charity are properly payable out of the principal assets of the estate of the incompetent rather than from the principal assets held in said revocable inter vivos trust and no part of said gift taxes should be paid out of said revocable inter vivos trust assets; that the long term effect under the present Internal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  Revenue Code and Rulings would enable the estate of the incompetent to pay substantially less in gift taxes than would be incurred in estate and inheritance taxes by reason of the assignment of income and declaration of irrevocability because gift taxes are computed at a lower rate compared to the maximum rate of estate and inheritance taxes and are a credit against any estate and inheritance taxes which might be payable with respect to the trust estate and because the amount paid in gift taxes will not be subject to estate or inheritance taxes.  In addition, it would save executors' fees and commissions on the amount of the gift taxes and administration costs in connection therewith and would constitute sound, wise, progressive, needed and essential estate planning in the best interests of the incompetent and of those who stand to take this estate upon her death and is within the discretionary authority of the Court and it is requested by your petitioner that he be permitted to raise sufficient funds for the purpose of paying said gift taxes by selling, or borrowing on the security of, such of the securities as your petitioner shall determine which are owned by the incompetent and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  are now held by Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York in custody in New York, New York.  That in all probability, the incompetent, if competent, would take the necessary steps to accomplish these purposes.  To allow the matter to remain in status quo with reference to the trust would serve only to needlessly deplete the estate and would benefit nobody except the executors or administrators of the incompetent's estate and the taxing authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(B) The petitioner respectfully petitions the Court to effectuate this sound estate planning, based on the tax and other economies involved and for the preservation of the estate of the incompetent which the incompetent would do for herself if competent, and eliminate what would otherwise be an unjust penalty and treatment of an incompetent and which would not befall a competent person making a sound estate plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notice and summons were served on (1) those who would take as heirs or distributees if Mrs. Kenan had died when the petitions were filed, (2) those who would take as legatees or devisees under her wills, (3) the trustees of the inter vivos trust created in December 1956, and those beneficially interested in the trust.  Guardians&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ad litem were appointed for Mrs. Kenan and minor or other incompetent beneficiaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murchison, guardian ad litem for Mrs. Kenan, and Burney, guardian ad litem for minors and unborn parties, by answers challenge the right of the trustee to make the proposed gifts.  They allege the statutes (c. 111, 112, and 113, S.L. 1963) violate provisions of the Constitutions of North Carolina and of the United States.  Among other constitutional rights asserted to be violated if the gifts are authorized are Art. I, sec. 17 of the Constitution of North Carolina and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">W. R. Kenan, Jr. and A. R. MacMannis, two of the trustees of the trust created by Mrs. Kenan in 1956, aver they seek to faithfully perform the duties Mrs. Kenan imposed on them.  Their answer to sec. 15 of the petition filed under the provisions of c. 113, S.L. 1963, reads:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(A) Answering the allegations of paragraph 15(A) of the Petition, these respondents admit that no part of the gift taxes should be paid out of the revocable inter vivos trust assets.  With regard to the other allegations of paragraph 15(A), these respondents deny any knowledge or information&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  sufficient to form a belief as to the truth thereof, except as to such allegations which may be questions of law, which they are informed and believe that they are not required to answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(B) These respondents deny any knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of allegations of paragraph 15(B) of the petition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sec. 2 of their further answer reads:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;That your respondents are informed and believe that the trust agreement dated December 26, 1956, is a validly executed and existing contract for which consideration has passed between the parties.  That among other things the trust agreement provides in effect as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(a) Article 1-A.  The net income shall be paid to or applied for the benefit of the donor so long as she shall live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(b) Article 2-A(1).  That in the event any beneficiary shall be 'incompetent,' that the income payable to said beneficiary may be paid to the guardian or committee or other legal representative wherever appointed of the said incompetent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(c) Article 2-D.  That no beneficiary shall have the right to dispose of or to assign or transfer any income from said trust until the same shall be paid or distributed to such&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  beneficiary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(d) Article 5.  The donor reserves the right to revoke or amend this agreement at any time and from time to time by a written instrument other than a will, duly executed and acknowledged by her and delivered during her life to the trustee at the time in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;That under these provisions of the said revocable trust agreement dated December 26, 1956, it was clearly the intention of the donor that she should receive the net income from said trust so long as she should live, and that in the event she became incompetent that the said income should be paid to her guardian or duly authorized legal representative; that no person entitled to receive income from said trust has the right to assign or dispose of the income prior to its receipt, and that she alone reserved the right to revoke or amend the said trust agreement during her lifetime.  That the effect of the relief requested by the petitioner in this action would be to rewrite the provisions of the contract to completely change donor's intention with respect to the paragraphs and articles hereinabove referred to, and that these respondents are informed and believe that the court is without authority to rewrite said&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  trust agreement in the respects requested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Mintz, resident judge of the Fifth District, of which New Hanover is a part, presided over the June 1963 Session.  The parties stipulated that the proceedings might be consolidated for the purpose of taking testimony, and waived a jury trial on all factual questions raised by the pleadings, except as to the probability of Mrs. Kenan's regaining mental capacity.  To determine that question, the court submitted this issue to a jury: &quot;Is it improbable that Sarah Graham Kenan, incompetent, will recover competency during her lifetime?&quot; The jury answered in the affirmative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Mintz made findings of fact in each proceeding.  Except as noted in the opinion, these findings are in accord with the allegations of the petition.  Based on the factual findings, the court drew legal conclusions and entered orders authorizing petitioner to make the gifts as requested except the proposed gift of $ 125,000 to The North Carolina Episcopal Church School for Boys, Inc., which was not then authorized.  </SPAN></P>

Appellee trustee claimed that the gifts would be beneficial to the ward in regards to taxes. The trial court approved the gifts, with one exception, and this appeal followed. On appeal, the court reversed the order. The court held that while the court could authorize the fiduciary to make a gift from the estate, such authority could be granted only upon finding that the ward, if then of sound mind, would make the gift. The court held that it was not the province of the courts to substitute their judgment or the wishes of the beneficiaries for the judgment and wishes of the testator and that there was no evidence of the ward's intent to make the gifts in question or that her concern was with tax implications.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff instituted this civil action to have the court determine by declaratory judgment his right to change his political party affiliation on the registration books of Guilford County Board of Elections without making oath &quot;that I will support the nominees of the party to which I am now changing my affiliation in the next election and the said party nominees thereafter until I shall, in good faith, change my party affiliation in the manner provided by law.&quot; The plaintiff prayed for a writ of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">mandamus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to compel the election officials to permit the requested change without requiring him to take the (to him) objectionable part of the loyalty oath above quoted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pleadings and stipulations establish the following: On and prior to October 3, 1962, plaintiff was a qualified and registered elector in Guilford County.  He was registered as a Democrat.  The defendants at all times pertinent to this inquiry held offices as stated in the caption.  The plaintiff applied to the Secretary of the County Board of Elections for a change in party affiliation from &quot;Democrat&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to &quot;Republican.&quot; He agreed to take the oath prescribed in G.S. 163-50, except the part above quoted, to which he objected upon the ground he did not know who the Republican nominees would be, their views on public questions at the time of the election, nor who the party candidates would be in future elections.  Hence, in good conscience, he could not swear that he would support them.  He offered to take the oath if the objectionable clause were eliminated.  The officials of the Board of Elections refused to permit the change without the full oath.  The plaintiff exhausted all administrative remedies prior to the institution of this action, in which Judge Shaw entered the following:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;2. The oath required by G.S. 163-50, does not abridge, modify or deprive any registered elector of any constitutional Rights, State or Federal, to which he is lawfully entitled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the plaintiff's action be dismissed, the relief sought by the plaintiff be denied, and the costs of this action be taxed against the plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The member applied to the officials for a change in party affiliation from &quot;Democrat&quot; to &quot;Republican.&quot; The officials refused to permit the change without the full oath. The issue was whether the general assembly acted within its competence in requiring, as a condition of the party transfer, that the member make oath in the manner set forth by statute. On review, the court reversed. Any elector who offered sufficient proof of his intent, in good faith, to change his party affiliation could not be required to bind himself by an oath, the violation of which, if not sufficient to brand him as a felon, was sufficient to operate as a deterrent to his exercising a free choice among available candidates at the election, even by casting a write-in ballot. The oath to support future candidates violated the principle of freedom of conscience. The court held that the legislature was without power to shackle a voter's conscience by requiring the objectionable part of the oath as a price to pay for his right to participate in his party's primary. The oath was divisible and remained, but with the objectionable part eliminated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was stipulated by the parties below that plaintiffs own a fee simple title to the premises involved subject to three deeds of trust not relevant to this action, all being subject to the legal effect of the language contained in plaintiffs' deed as well as in other deeds in their chain of title.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. Defendant's Exhibit 'B' is an authenticated copy of the blueprint of a survey of T. J. Orr, Registered Surveyor, of the property of T. Frank Estate dated March, 1948.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. The plaintiffs have on said tract of land a stucco building which is located approximately 49 feet south of the center line of Wilkinson Boulevard as shown on plaintiffs' Exhibit '4'.  Said building was erected in approximately 1928 or 1929.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. The State Highway Commission duly adopted the following ordinance or resolution on October 27, 1926.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">'Resolved that in the judgment of the Commission it is necessary for the protection of the State Highway Commission and the safety of travel, that State Highway Projects&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  #635, #650, Charlotte to Gastonia, and Project #542, Greensboro to High Point, have a right of way of one hundred feet, that is fifty feet from the center of the road with such additional right of way inside the curves as will provide for at least two hundred feet clear vision, the Chairman of the State Highway Commission is authorized and empowered to take all necessary legal steps in the name of the Commission to acquire said right of way either by purchase, gift or condemnation.'</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. The State Highway Commission completed Project 6503 on September 17, 1928.  This project was for grading the entire length of Wilkinson Boulevard from the City Limits of Charlotte to the Catawba River.  The project called for a right of way of 100 feet or 50 feet each side of the center line of Wilkinson Boulevard.  The defendant's Exhibit 'H' are the plans and specifications and show the work done on said project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;6. After the completion of Project 6503, the State Highway Commission placed wooden 4 X 4 posts, painted white, with the notation R/W along Wilkinson Boulevard on either side of the highway 50 feet from the center line of the highway.  These posts extended approximately 2 feet out of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the ground and were placed approximately every 1000 feet alternating from north to south of the highway (or 2000 feet apart on either side of the highway), and at all points of curves and points of tangents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;7. A surveyor's 'hub' with a tack was placed on the land now owned by the plaintiffs, 50 feet from the center line of the highway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;8. The State Highway Commission appropriated a 100 foot right of way for Wilkinson Boulevard from the City Limits of Charlotte to the Catawba River in September, 1928 by the construction of Project 6503.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;9. The lands of the plaintiffs were owned by Katie Frank from January 9, 1924 until her death on August 7, 1930.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. While Project 6503 was being constructed, T. Frank, husband of Katie Frank, operated a barbecue restaurant and had a wooden building located on the aforesaid land.  The building occupied an area within 50 feet south of the center line of Project 6503.  This building was removed in approximately 1928.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;11. Katie Frank's signature appears on defendant's Exhibit 'D' which is a release by T. Frank to the State Highway Commission for all damages on Project No. 6503 and bears the date March 5, 1929 [which release reads as follows: &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  'T. Frank.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">RELEASE OF CLAIM FOR DAMAGES</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  Project 6503, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina.  I, T. Frank, of Rte. 4, Charlotte, N. C., in consideration of Eight Hundred and Fifty ($ 850.00) Dollars, Warrant No. 60468, paid by the North Carolina State Highway Commission, hereby release and discharge the said Commission from all claims and demands which I have against it in law or in equity, arising out of any and all contracts, liabilities, acts, and omissions in the past or which may result from the present condition of things.  Witness my hand and seal this 29th day of February, 1929.  T. Frank (SEAL) Katie Frank'].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;12. Katie Frank had actual notice of the construction of Project 6503 in March, 1929.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;13. In approximately 1930 through 1931, the State Highway Commission erected signs at the Charlotte City Limits and along Wilkinson Boulevard west to the Catawba River on either side of Wilkinson Boulevard at intervals of approximately 2 1/2 miles.  Said signs were similar to defendant's Exhibit 'E' and bore the legend 'Notice -- R/W of this highway 50 feet each side of the center line.' These signs have been maintained until the present time by the State Highway Commission. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;14. Mr. R. Brown was employed by the State Highway Commission from 1933 until 1957 as Maintenance Supervisor for Mecklenburg County.  During the period of his employment, his department maintained the entire 100 foot right of way on Wilkinson Boulevard.  Crews under his direction cut grass on the right of way, cleaned ditches and cleared all trees except shade trees in front of residences.  On one occasion in 1950 Mr. Brown required the plaintiffs' predecessor in title, M. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">(sic)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaperonis, to remove a curb or a low wall obstruction from the 50 foot right of way which had been erected on the property now owned by the plaintiffs.  Mr. Brown observed the 4 X 4 right of way post in place 50 feet from the center line of Wilkinson Boulevard all along the Boulevard while he was maintaining Wilkinson Boulevard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;15. On January 8, 1962, the State Highway Commission began Project 8.16567.  This project was a widening of the paved portions of Wilkinson Boulevard adjacent to the plaintiffs' property from 36 feet to 85 feet, and placing curbing along the edge of the pavement.  This project was completed October 17, 1962.  * * *&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court below concluded as a matter of law that,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  plaintiffs have record title to the aforesaid triangular tract of land subject to the right of way of the State Highway Commission for a highway of 50 feet as shown on the blueprint of survey of T. J. Orr dated March 1948, which survey is incorporated by reference in the deed under which plaintiffs claim title;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. The State Highway Commission entered and appropriated a 100 foot easement for Wilkinson Boulevard by Project 6503, which project was completed on September 17, 1928, and the right to compensation for the taking of any portion of the lands which the plaintiffs now own belonged to the then owner of the fee, Mrs. K. Frank.  Said claim to compensation was not assigned to the plaintiffs by the various deeds conveying title to the fee to the plaintiffs.  The plaintiffs have no claim for compensation for the taking of the 50 foot highway right of way in September, 1928;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. Any claim for compensation for the taking of the 100 foot easement, 50 feet of which was across the land now owned by the plaintiffs, was barred by the applicable Statute of Limitations six months after the completion of Project 6503, which project was completed September 17, 1928;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. The defendant State&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Highway Commission did not take any property of the plaintiffs by the construction of its project 8.16567, and there is no issue of damages to submit to a jury;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. That North Carolina General Statutes 136-108 is constitutional and does not deprive the plaintiffs of their right to trial by jury as the same is guaranteed by the North Carolina and United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NOW, THEREFORE, it is ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. That the blueprint of survey of the property of T. Frank Estate dated March, 1948 which has been introduced into evidence as defendant's Exhibit 'B' constitutes the filing of a plat in this action in accordance with G.S. 136-106 (C).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. That the plaintiffs' motion that this matter be transferred and heard before a jury is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. That this action be and is hereby dismissed on its merits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. That the costs of this action be taxed against the plaintiffs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs appeal, assigning error.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff landowners challenged a judgment of the Special Civil &quot;B&quot; Session of Mecklenburg (North Carolina) which dismissed their action against defendant state highway commission (commission) to obtain compensation for the alleged taking of a strip of their land for a highway right of way. The trial court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 136-108 was not unconstitutional and that the landowners were not entitled to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">In the landowners' compensation claim, the trial court found that before the landowners owned the disputed strip of land, the commission had passed an ordinance taking a right of way encompassing the disputed strip and that the owner of the land at that time had signed a release and accepted compensation for the taking. The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the landowners' action. Section 136-108 was not unconstitutional for its failure to allow jury trials in compensation claims because private property could properly be taken for public purposes without a jury. The Seventh Amendment did not preserve the right of trial by jury in civil actions in which the prerogative did not exist at common law. The admission of a survey showing the right of way was not error because the map was referred to in the deed by which the landowners' predecessors in title conveyed the premises, and therefore did not have to be registered. Evidence of the ordinance creating the right of way and to the commission's occupation and maintenance of the land was properly admitted, and handwriting evidence was properly used to authenticate the signature of the owner who signed the release.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court affirmed the trial court judgment dismissing the landowners' complaint for compensation for an alleged taking of a strip of their land by the commission for a highway right of way.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action to establish plaintiff's ownership and right to possession of real property in which the court, granting plaintiff's motion therefor, entered judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are thirteen numbered paragraphs (exclusive of the prayer for relief) in the complaint.  Answering, defendant admitted categorically the allegations of paragraphs Nos. 1-9, inclusive, and of paragraphs Nos. 11 and 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts so admitted are summarized, except when quoted, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formerly, plaintiff and defendant were husband and wife.  On November 6, 1961, in an action in the Superior Court of Surry County, North Carolina, defendant obtained an absolute divorce on the ground of two years' separation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On or about July 26, 1958, plaintiff and defendant, then husband and wife, separated; and on that date they entered into a separation agreement &quot;which was duly executed by both parties, with privy examination and acknowledgment of the defendant before Justice of the Peace H. M. Foy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paragraph 2 of said separation agreement of July 26, 1958, provides:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is further understood and agreed that the husband&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  will pay to the wife in a lump sum the amount of Two Thousand and Five Hundred ($ 2,500.00) Dollars simultaneously with the execution of this agreement and in consideration of the payment of the sum of $ 2,500.00 by the husband to the wife, the wife does hereby release, discharge and quitclaim any right to support, maintenance, alimony, alimony </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">pendente lite</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and any and all rights of action, causes of action, claims or demands which she might or could hereafter assert against the said husband by virtue of the marital relationship presently existing between the said husband and wife, the parties herein.  In addition to the foregoing and in consideration of the payment of the aforementioned sum by the husband to the wife, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">the wife does hereby covenant, contract and agree to execute a warranty deed conveying any and all right, title and interest which she now owns in and to the home heretofore occupied by the parties as husband and wife, said deed to be simultaneously executed with the execution of this contract</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">she does hereby quitclaim and release any and all right, title and interest in and to that certain dwelling house heretofore occupied by the parties, situated</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"> on the south side of Highway #601, in White Plains, as described in Deed Book 181, page 421 and 440, Surry County Registry, to which reference is hereby made, and said deed is hereby incorporated by reference</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot; (Our italics).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 26, 1958, plaintiff and defendant executed a warranty deed conveying to Thomas M. Faw the property in White Plains described in paragraph 2 of the separation agreement of July 26, 1958, referred to hereafter as the subject property; and on July 28, 1958, Thomas M. Faw and wife, Virginia S. Faw, conveyed the subject property to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On some date between July 28, 1958, and August 27, 1958, plaintiff and defendant resumed marital relations.  They separated again on August 27, 1958, at which time they &quot;duly executed and acknowledged&quot; another separation agreement.  Paragraph 2 of the separation agreement of August 27, 1958, in part, provides: &quot;In addition to the foregoing and in consideration of the payment of the aforementioned sum by the husband to the wife, the wife does hereby release, quitclaim, and discharge any and all right, title and interest in and to any of the real property now owned by the husband or heretofore owned by the parties as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  tenants by the entireties and does specifically release her inchoate right of dower in and to the real property owned by the husband, party of the first part herein.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 27, 1958, simultaneous with the execution of the separation agreement of that date, plaintiff and defendant again conveyed the subject property to Thomas M. Faw; and on the same date Thomas M. Faw and wife, Virginia S. Faw, conveyed the subject property to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November, 1958, plaintiff and defendant again resumed marital relations.  They separated again in 1959.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The said separation agreements and deeds were recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds of Surry County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the deeds to Faw, the property is described by metes and bounds and also by reference to the deeds by which it was conveyed to plaintiff and defendant, to wit, the deeds recorded in Book 181, Page 421, and in Book 181, Page 440, said Registry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no private examination of the wife or certificate in accordance with G.S. 52-12 in connection with the execution and acknowledgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">the deeds to Faw</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff's controverted allegations are summarized below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff alleged he was ousted from the subject property&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in 1959; that defendant has had possession thereof but has paid no rent; and that a fair rental value is $ 125.00 per month.  Answering, defendant admitted she had had possession; that she had paid no rent; and that $ 125.00 per month is a fair rental value.  She alleged plaintiff was not unlawfully ousted but that defendant was given possession of the subject property in November, 1959, by an order of the Superior Court of Surry County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff's allegations that he is the owner of the subject property, subject to outstanding deeds of trust thereon, and is entitled to possession thereof, and that defendant has no right, title or interest therein or to possession thereof, are denied by defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, for a further answer and defense, alleged in substance the following: Two children, then 13 and 18 years of age, were born of the marriage of plaintiff and defendant.  At the November Term, 1959, of the Superior Court of Surry County, his Honor, Allen H. Gwyn, the Presiding Judge, upon motion of the present defendant, entered an order, after a hearing for relief </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">pendente lite</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in which the present defendant was granted possession &quot;of the homeplace,&quot; to wit, the subject property, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as a place of residence for the present defendant and her minor children.  There has been no final judgment in the cause in which said order was entered.  The separation agreements were nullified by the resumption(s) of marital relations.  Plaintiff and defendant, since said absolute divorce, have been and are owners of the subject property as tenants in common.  In any event, defendant is entitled to possession under Judge Gwyn's order unless and until it is modified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff did not reply to the allegations of defendant's said further answer and defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff moved for judgment on the pleadings on the asserted ground that &quot;the properly pleaded allegations of the answer, even if taken to be true for the purpose of this motion, do not constitute a valid and legal defense to the claim and demands set forth in the complaint or to any part thereof.&quot; After a hearing on plaintiff's said motion Judge Walker entered judgment which, after recitals, provides:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the plaintiff is owner of the previously described realty herein, to the exclusion of the defendant; and that the defendant is taxed with the costs of this action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;IT&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  IS FURTHER ORDERED that no ejectment should issue in this case against the defendant until the time for appealing this judgment has expired, or, should the judgment be appealed, until this case has been decided upon appeal.  Should said appeal not be perfected, the plaintiff is entitled to have the defendant ejected from the premises.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant excepted, appealed and assigns as error &quot;the granting of plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings . . .&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant wife sought review of the judgment of the Surry County Superior Court (North Carolina), which found in favor of appellee husband in his action to claim ownership of the marital home as a result of the wife's transfer to him pursuant to a separation agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Before they were finally divorced, the husband and the wife went through a series of separations and reconciliations. During the first separation, they executed a separation agreement whereby the wife conveyed all of her interest in the marital home to the husband. The transfer was completed and the two of them conveyed the property to another couple who then conveyed the property to the husband. After one of the later reconciliations and separations, the wife remained in the marital home. The husband filed an action to establish his ownership of the property and to eject the wife therefrom. The trial court found in favor of the husband. On appeal, the court modified the judgment by striking the husband's right to eject the wife, and affirmed. The court found that the transfer of the wife's interest in the property was valid and was not affected by their subsequent reconciliations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court modified the judgment by striking out the order for the wife to be ejected, and as modified, affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs brought this civil action demanding judgment:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;1. That the paper writing purporting to be the deed dated the 16th day of February, 1962, and recorded in the Office of the Register of Deeds of Buncombe County, North Carolina, in Deed Book 859, page 349, be declared null and void and of no force and effect, and be stricken from the records of the Register of Deeds of Buncombe County, North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;2. That the entire paper writing purporting to be a contract between these plaintiffs and the defendant arising out of the defendant's purported dissent to the will of Gertrude Roberson Penland be declared null, void and of no force and effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;3. That the constitutional rights of the deceased, Gertrude Roberson Penland, be fully protected and enforced and that the Executor thereof be directed to execute her said last will and testament fully in accordance with the same, and in accordance with said Constitution and the valid laws of the State, as fully and completely as if no acts or things had been done in conflict therewith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;4. That all parties be restored&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  to the same position and status to which they are entitled by virtue of all valid existing laws of the State of North Carolina.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the sole basis for the relief demanded, the plaintiffs alleged they executed the deed and entered into the consent judgment giving the defendant a large share in his wife's estate because of their mistaken belief the defendant had the legal right to dissent from the will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attached to the complaint was the will of Gertrude Roberson Penland, dated August 20, 1960.  The will provided:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(a) I give, devise and bequeath unto my husband, Mack Penland, the sum of TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS, in fee simple forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(b) That after the payment of the costs of administration, all the balance of the proceeds of said sale of said property, together with any other property that I may own or possess shall be divided into five (5) equal shares or parts, and one part thereof paid to the following named persons: One part to my sister, Mary Roberson Byrd; One part to my brother, Ged Roberson; One part to my brother, Luther Roberson; One part to my brother, Hollis Roberson; and one part to my nephew, Joe Roberson, in fee simple forever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the 25th day of August, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1961, the defendant filed a dissent to his wife's will, giving notice of his election not to take under the will but to demand his share of his wife's property as if she had died intestate.  The dissent was drafted in conformity with G.S., Chapter 30.  Subsequent to the filing of the dissent, the parties personally and through counsel carried on extensive negotiations looking to a settlement of their respective rights in the estate.  The negotiations culminated in an agreement fixing the rights of the several devisees and legatees under the will.  The consent judgment and the deed implemented the agreement.  Both are here under attack upon the ground the parties acted under the mistaken belief a husband, by dissent, became entitled to share as in case of his wife's intestacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Martin, of the Superior Court, by consent, found facts which are not in dispute, and concluded:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;1.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiffs, beneficiaries under a testatrix's will, sought to rescind a deed and consent judgment by which they and defendant, the testatrix's husband, settled their respective claims in the property owned by the deceased. The Buncombe County Superior Court (North Carolina) denied the beneficiaries the relief requested. The beneficiaries appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">After the probate of the testatrix's will, the husband filed a dissent pursuant to statute. Thereafter, negotiations between the parties and their counsel followed, and all assumed the husband had a legal right to dissent from the will. The negotiations culminated in the consent judgment and deed. Subsequent to the settlement, the statute under which the husband filed his dissent was held to be unconstitutional. At that time, however, the consent judgment had already been signed and approved and the deed had been executed, delivered, and recorded. On appeal, the beneficiaries argued that the unconstitutional statute was a nullity from its inception that justified no acts performed under it. The appellate court disagreed, holding that the rights of the parties had been fixed by the deed and consent judgment, which could not be set aside merely because the parties' lawyers were unable to anticipate that the statute permitting the husband's suit would be held unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff Ed Rice and by Donald Stines, Intervenor, and appeal by plaintiff Charles Davis, by his next friend Robert Allen, and by Donald Stines, Intervenor, from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Riddle, S.J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 4 February 1963 Civil Session of Madison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action by plaintiff Ed Rice to recover damages for personal injuries allegedly caused by the actionable negligence of defendant William Rigsby in the operation of his automobile, plaintiff being a passenger therein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant William Rigsby in his answer denied negligence, and, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, pleaded conditionally contributory negligence of plaintiff as a bar to recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff Charles Davis, by his next friend Robert Allen, instituted a similar action against defendant Rigsby.  In the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Davis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case defendant Rigsby filed a similar answer as in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Rice</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 10 December 1962 Regular Civil Session of Madison, Riddle, S.J., entered an order consolidating these two cases for trial, and setting them as the first cases for trial at the next session of Madison County superior court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When these two cases were called for trial at 4 February 1963 Civil Session, defendant Rigsby challenged the array of jurors returned by the sheriff to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  serve at that session of court on the following grounds: (1) Chapter 358, 1955 Session Laws of North Carolina, providing for the selection of jurors by a jury commissioner in Madison County and for the appointment of said commissioner by the resident judge, is unconstitutional; and (2) the array of jurors returned by the sheriff to serve at that session of court was improperly drawn and not a legally constituted array of jurors, in that the panel had been selected and drawn by one Donald Stines, who was not in fact the jury commissioner for Madison County.  Judge Riddle heard the challenge to the array of jurors upon the testimony of Donald Stines, who was subpoenaed by defendant Rigsby, and after argument of counsel, entered one order wherein he found the following facts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Stines was appointed jury commissioner for Madison County, pursuant to Chapter 358, 1955 Session Laws of North Carolina, took the oath of office required by the statute in May 1955, and has served continuously under this appointment to the present time.  About three years ago Stines, while serving as jury commissioner, was appointed to and took the oath of office as a member of the Walnut School Board, which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is a part of Madison County Public School System.  He served on such school board until the Walnut and Marshall Schools were consolidated, and since such consolidation he has served as a member of the consolidated school board, and was so serving when the panel of jurors for this session of court was drawn.  Stines has not preserved the list of jurors whose names are contained in the jury boxes, and has not revised the jury list every two years.  Chapter 358, 1955 Session Laws of North Carolina, makes no provisions for the qualifications of person to be appointed jury commissioner, for the qualifications of persons whose names are to be placed in the jury box, for safeguarding the names in the jury box, and for the manner of drawing names from the jury box and the number to be drawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the facts found by him Judge Riddle drew the following conclusions of law:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One. Chapter 358, 1955 Session Laws of North Carolina, is in contravention of the provisions of the Constitutions of the United States and of the State of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two. When Donald Stines accepted office as a member of the Walnut School Board, he immediately vacated the office of jury commissioner for Madison County, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  because both are public offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three. The provisions of Chapter 358, 1955 Sessions Laws of North Carolina, in respect to the preserving of a jury list and the revising of the list are mandatory, and Stines' failure to comply with these statutory requirements makes the jury panel drawn for this session of court unlawful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereupon, Judge Riddle adjudged and decreed that the panel of jurors returned by the sheriff was not lawfully constituted, that Chapter 358, 1955 Session Laws, was unconstitutional, and dismissed the panel of jurors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From this order both plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 13 February 1963 J. Frank Huskins, resident judge of Madison County, entered an order allowing Donald Stines' petition to intervene in these two cases, to file exceptions to Judge Riddle's order of 4 February 1963, and to appeal to the Supreme Court.  Donald Stines has a number of assignments of error in the record, and has appealed to the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 13 February 1963 Judge Huskins entered an order allowing the petition of Bill Roberts, Chairman of the Board of County Commissioners of Madison County, Hilliard Teague, Register of Deeds of Madison County, and E. Y. Ponder, Sheriff&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Madison County, to become parties and intervene in these two cases that they may take such action as they are advised with reference to Judge Riddle's order of 4 February 1963. Mr. Bill Roberts, Mr. Hilliard Teague, and Sheriff E. Y. Ponder have no assignments of error in the record, and have not appealed.  </SPAN></P>

Sess. Laws 358.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The injured parties filed separate actions against the driver contending that he was negligent in his ownership and operation of his motor vehicle. The trial court consolidated both cases into one trial. After the jury was impaneled, the driver filed a challenge to the array of jurors contending that 1955 N.C. Sess. Laws 358 was unconstitutional and that the array of jurors returned by the sheriff to serve was improperly drawn and not a legally constituted array of jurors in that the panel was drawn by the jury commissioner. Initially, the court noted that the driver failed to allege the specific constitutional provision that he contended was violated by the statute in question. The court determined that the challenged act was not repugnant of the specific sections of both the Federal and the North Carolina Constitutions. Therefore, the trial court's order dismissing the jurors and holding that ch. 358 unconstitutional was in error.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action, by virtue of G.S. 1-538.1 to recover $ 500.00 in damages from the parents of an eleven-year-old son living with them for his malicious or wilful destruction of property, heard upon a demurrer to an amended complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We summarize the allegations of the amended complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff issued to the Kinston City Board of Education its policy number 43-125F-4064 providing insurance coverage for the Teachers Memorial School in Kinston.  Among the risks covered by the policy was loss by fire to the building and its contents to the maximum limit of $ 479,000.00. The policy was in full force and effect on 1 December 1961.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 1 December 1961 Freddie Faulkner, an eleven-year-old boy living with his parents, went into the auditorium of the Teachers Memorial School and maliciously and wilfully set fire to certain drapes or curtains constituting a part of the furnishings of the auditorium, and before the fire was discovered and extinguished it had damaged the property of the school in the amount of $ 2,916.50. This damage was proximately caused by the malicious and wilful conduct&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Freddie Faulkner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kinston City Board of Education made demand upon plaintiff under the provisions of its policy for payment for its loss by fire in the amount of $ 2,916.50, which amount plaintiff paid under the provisions of its policy, and plaintiff thereby became subrogated to the rights and claims of the Kinston City Board of Education against any tort-feasor or tort-feasors responsible for the fire and loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff is entitled to recover from defendants a sum not to exceed $ 500.00 by virtue of the provisions of G.S. 1-538.1, and prays for a recovery from the defendants, jointly and severally, in the amount of $ 500.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants demurred to the amended complaint upon the following grounds:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One. It fails to allege that any act or omission to act on the part of the defendants was the proximate cause of any injury to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two. Plaintiff is not one of the persons, firms, corporations, or organizations named in G.S. 1-538.1 as being authorized to institute an action and recover under the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three. It fails to allege facts sufficient to show that plaintiff is the real party in interest, and entitled to maintain the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four. The statute is penal in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  nature, is not based on any default or wrongful act on the part of the defendants, is in derogation of the common law, and plaintiff is not entitled to maintain this action as subrogee or otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five. G.S. 1-538.1 is unconstitutional as being in violation of Article I, section 17, of the North Carolina Constitution, and in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six. It fails to allege sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for the breach of any legal duty on the part of the defendants, or either of them, or any legal liability on their part.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-538.1 from defendants for their child's malicious or wilful destruction of property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff issued to a board an insurance policy covering loss by fire to the board's building and its contents. Defendants' minor child maliciously and willfully set a fire and damaged the board's property. The board made a demand upon plaintiff which plaintiff paid under the provisions of its policy, and plaintiff thereby became subrogated to the rights and claims of the board against any tort-feasor or tort-feasors responsible for the fire and loss. Plaintiff brought suit against defendants. On appeal, the court held that the N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-538.1, made parents vicariously liable by virtue of their parental relationship for the malicious, or wilful, or intentional acts of their children was within the state's police power, and that it was not violative of the state constitution, or of the federal constitution. Thus plaintiff's amended complaint stated facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against defendants under the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Because the statute was not unconstitutional and plaintiff's amended complaint stated facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action under the statute, the court ordered the judgment sustaining the demurrer reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The State challenged a decision of the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina), which granted defendant's motion to quash the warrant issued against him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">In February 1962, the city counsel adopted a new ordinance, which was the provision under which defendant was prosecuted. On appeal, the court sought to determine whether the February ordinance was within the powers conferred upon the city by the General Assembly. The court found that the conduct proscribed by the ordinance was the sale or offering for sale at any time to any person of any age of any ice cream product from any mobile unit on any street or alley of the city under any circumstances. There was no evidence that the ordinance was adopted on account of injury to children or other condition resulting from such sales or offerings. Based on its legislative review, the court concluded that the sale and offering for sale of ice cream on public streets was a lawful business or occupation. Moreover, the city did not have express authority to prohibit or to regulate the business or occupation of peddling except by imposing license taxes thereon. In the exercise of its express powers, the city could have adopted an ordinance providing for the reasonable regulation, but not for prohibition of the sale and offering for sale of merchandise upon its streets from mobile units.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment in favor of the taxpayers. On appeal, the court set aside the judgment and remanded. The commissioner admitted that the taxpayers sold their coops to farmers, poultrymen and persons, and firms and corporations engaged in the poultry business, and that such coops were used by such customers in the delivery of live poultry, which was sold by such customers at either wholesale or retail. Such allegations in the complaint and admissions in the answer were not sufficient to exempt the taxpayers' sales of coops from the sales tax within the purview and intent of N.C. Gen.

There was no allegation that when the taxpayers' vendees sold poultry, the coops constituted a part of the sale of such poultry and were delivered with the poultry to the customer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioners held a permit to sell malt beverages for consumption on their premises known as Las Vagas Inn.  On 30 May 1961 the chairman of the State Board of Alcoholic Control (hereafter Board) notified petitioners they were charged with violations of G.S. 18-78 and 78.1, which, if established, would warrant revocation of their permit.  The notice fixed the time and place for hearing the charges.  Petitioners were informed they might offer evidence, and the evidence given at the hearing would be transmitted to the Board for appropriate action.  The notice specifically stated it was given as required by G.S. 18-137.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assistant director conducted a hearing at the time and place fixed in the notice.  Evidence sufficient to establish the sale of beer to an intoxicated customer named in the charges and failure of licensees to properly supervise the operation of their business was offered by respondents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner Fermanides testified at the hearing.  Petitioners were represented by counsel.  Other witnesses testified for petitioners.  Adverse witnesses were cross-examined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  evidence was concluded, counsel for petitioners argued the cause of his clients.  The hearing examiner then inquired if there was anything further, and, receiving a negative reply, he said: &quot;The evidence taken here today in this case will be presented to the State ABC Board at its next regular meeting which is now scheduled for July 7.  At that time the Board will review the evidence taken here today.  They will make their decision, and the Chairman of the State ABC Board will notify Mr. Fermanides and Mr. Sinodis by mail in regards to their decision and will send you a copy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hearing examiner transmitted the evidence, tentative findings, and recommendations to the Board.  At its meeting on 7 July 1961 the Board reviewed the evidence taken by the hearing examiner, found as a fact that petitioners had violated the statutory provisions as charged, and thereupon suspended the permit to sell malt beverages for a period of 45 days, effective July 21, 1961.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In due time petitioners filed a petition for judicial review as permitted by G.S. 143-306&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In their petition for review they assert they had no opportunity to see the hearing commissioner's summary of the evidence and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his recommended findings of fact nor to appear before the Board before it acted, and for these reasons the statutory proceeding which permits revocation or suspension of license for the sale of malt beverages violates the provision of the Constitution of North Carolina and the Constitution of the United States &quot;for the reason the same denies the petitioners herein a proper hearing as required by the due process clauses of the constitutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondents filed certified copy of the entire record, including the testimony taken at the hearing conducted by the assistant director consisting of questions and answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Clark reviewed the record as certified by the Board.  After reciting the facts stated above, he found petitioners were not furnished a copy of the hearing officer's proposed findings nor were they afforded an opportunity to appear before the Board to argue the facts and law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court, being of the opinion that the statutes authorizing the suspension or revocation of permits to sell malt beverages were unconstitutional, entered judgment dismissing the proceedings against petitioners.  Respondents excepted and appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Respondent, the State Board of Alcoholic Control, Malt Beverage Division, sought review of a decision by the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina), which dismissed proceedings against petitioner bar owners. It was held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 18-78 to -78.1, authorizing the suspension or revocation of permits to sell malt beverages, were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The State Board notified the bar owners that they were charged with violations of &sect;&sect; 18-78 to -78.1, which, if established, warranted the revocation of their permit. The Board later found the bar owners were in violation. The bar owners appealed the decision to the superior court, which reversed. The issue for review was whether a permit to sell intoxicating beverages could be suspended or cancelled without notice and hearing. Because the statutes expressly accorded the bar owners the right to a hearing, the only questions for determination were what kind of hearing the statute contemplated and whether or not the bar owners had been denied a hearing of the kind contemplated by the statute. The court found that there was nothing in the record that justified the contention that the bar owners had been denied a hearing of the kind contemplated by the statute and provided for by the rules of the Board. The bar owners did not request a hearing by the Board, a right expressly accorded them. Hence their application for judicial review had to be dismissed. Only those who had exhausted their administrative remedies could seek the benefit of the statute under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 143-307.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suit to restrain permanently the acting superintendent of building inspection for the city of Charlotte and the city of Charlotte from enforcing the provisions of section 23-84 of chapter 23 of the Charlotte city code, which section regulates signs in the area zoned &quot;B-3 Business Districts,&quot; on the ground that this section of the Charlotte city code violates plaintiffs' rights guaranteed to them by Article I, sections 1 and 17 of the North Carolina Constitution, and by amendments I and XIV of the United States Constitution, heard upon an order to show cause why a temporary injunction should not be granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The show cause order was heard by Judge Copeland upon the verified pleadings of the parties offered as affidavits, the affidavit of S. A.

Based upon admissions in the answer of facts alleged in the complaint and upon detailed findings of fact made for the purposes of the order, the judge signed a temporary injunction restraining, until a final trial upon the merits, defendants from enforcing the provisions of section 23-84 of chapter 23 of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Charlotte city code as it relates to plaintiffs' business, provided plaintiffs shall conform to such regulations as are imposed by the provisions of this section of the city code with respect to business signs projecting into the street right-of-way in the area zoned as &quot;B-3 Business Districts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a summary of the essential admissions in the answer and of the essential findings of fact set forth in the order granting a temporary injunction:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs are, and have been for many years, engaged in an outdoor advertising business in Charlotte, with an investment of many thousands of dollars and 17 employees.

They have in Charlotte as competitors for the advertising dollars two firms engaged in similar business, two newspapers, and TV and radio stations.  They have built and own in Charlotte about 500 outdoor advertising structures attached to or placed on leased buildings and land, about one-fifth of which are located in the area zoned as &quot;B-3 Business Districts&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the Charlotte city code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 29 January 1962 the Charlotte city council enacted and put into effect a new comprehensive zoning ordinance, which is ordinance 62 and is set forth in chapter 23 of the city code, which is made a part of the findings of fact.  Section 23-2, (22), (a), of the city code defines an &quot;Advertising Sign&quot; as &quot;A sign which directs attention to a business, commodity, service or entertainment conducted, sold or offered: (1) Only elsewhere than upon the premises where the sign is displayed, or (2) As a minor and incidental activity upon the premises where the sign is displayed.&quot; Section 23-2, (22), (b), of the city code defines a &quot;Business Sign&quot; as &quot;A sign which directs attention to a business, profession or industry located upon the premises where the sign is displayed, to type of products sold, manufactured or assembled, and/or to service or entertainment offered on said premises, but not a sign pertaining to the preceding if such activity is only minor and incidental to the principal use of the premises.&quot; Section 23-84 of the city code, entitled &quot;B-3 Business Districts,&quot; permits in the area thus zoned only Identification and Business Signs, with no limitation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the number or maximum area of the permitted signs, but with a limitation as to the projection of such signs into the street right-of-way, and prohibits all new &quot;Advertising Signs,&quot; as such signs are defined in the city code, in that area which advertise businesses and other activities conducted elsewhere than on the particular property on which the sign is located.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The value of plaintiffs' services to their customers is based upon the exposure of their locations to motor vehicular traffic.  Though their locations in the area zoned as &quot;B-3 Business Districts&quot; comprise only about 20% of their locations in Charlotte, these locations, as measured by standard outdoor advertising traffic measurements, provide more than 20% of the exposure of their locations to such traffic.  Advertisers demand coverage in all business and industrial areas in Charlotte in accordance with nationally accepted advertising practice, and without being able to afford such services they cannot successfully compete with their business rivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs' leases of locations for their &quot;Advertising Signs&quot; are for periods of one to three years, and are terminable at the discretion of the lessor upon 30 days' notice, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  if the premises are sold or put to some other use, and because of the growth and change in Charlotte causing a termination of their leases, they must relocate 20% of their signs each year, including their signs in the area zoned as &quot;B-3 Business Districts.&quot; Between the effective date of chapter 23 of the city code and the institution of this suit, due to the termination of their leases, they have lost ten sign locations in the area zoned as &quot;B-3 Business Districts.&quot; If they are not permitted to seek new locations for their &quot;Advertising Signs,&quot; as such signs are defined in the city code, in the area zoned as &quot;B-3 Business Districts,&quot; and if their &quot;Advertising Signs,&quot; as defined in the city code, are excluded from this area, they will suffer heavy losses of business, their investment in their business will be jeopardized, many, if not all, of their employees will lose their jobs, and they have no adequate remedy at law to contest the validity of section 23-84 of chapter 23 of the city code which will save their business from irreparable damage, unless equitable relief is granted.  The damage which plaintiffs will suffer, pending a trial on the merits, if section 23-84 of the ordinance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is enforced will greatly exceed any damage defendants may suffer by reason of the issuance of a temporary injunction pending a final trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Copeland made conclusions of law, which we summarize in part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the statute authorizing Charlotte to enact zoning regulations does purport to authorize enactment of section 23-84 of chapter 23 of the city code, permitting in the area zoned as &quot;B-3 Business Districts&quot; Identification and Business Signs, but prohibiting therein &quot;Advertising Signs,&quot; which are the signs used by plaintiffs in their business, this section as applied to plaintiffs violates their constitutional right to equal protection of the laws, in that the distinction between &quot;Advertising Signs,&quot; as defined in the city code, and &quot;Business Signs,&quot; as defined in the city code, is not based upon consideration of health, morals, safety or general welfare, or any other considerations, justifying the exercise of police power, and that this section of the city code as it operates with respect to plaintiffs and their business is arbitrary and capricious, and &quot;violates constitutional provisions pleaded in the complaint.&quot; Plaintiffs have established a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">prima facie</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case for the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  granting of a permanent injunction, and it is within the equitable powers of the court to grant a temporary injunction to preserve the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">status quo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of the parties and the operation of plaintiffs' business free of the challenged provisions of the Charlotte city code, until the rights of the parties can be finally adjudicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the order granting the temporary injunction, defendants appeal.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendants, City of Charlotte and building inspector, appealed the judgment from the trial court, Mecklenberg (North Carolina), which granted plaintiff advertising company a temporary injunction that prohibited defendants from enforcing a city ordinance that regulated outdoor advertising activity in a particular zoned area.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The advertising company built and owned 500 outdoor advertising structures in the area. Twenty percent of the company's structures were in areas that would be affected by the city's zoning ordinance. The company alleged that those locations provided more than 20 percent of their advertising exposure to traffic and that without their use, the company could not successfully compete in its market. The trial court temporarily enjoined enforcement of the ordinance and found that the ordinance violated the company's right to equal protection. The court affirmed and found that the company set out sufficient facts to show that it would suffer irreparable damage by enforcement of the ordinance. However, the trial court's finding that the ordinance violated the company's constitutional rights was not binding as the law of the case. The constitutionality of the ordinance was for the superior court on the final hearing on the merits after presentation of all of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that temporarily restrained the city and building inspector from enforcing the ordinance on outdoor advertising.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Paul, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at Chambers in the City of Washton, County of Beaufort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petition for writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allegations of the complaint are summarized as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff is a resident and elector of Beaufort County, a member of the Republican Party in good standing, and is registered as a Republican.  On 10 April 1962 plaintiff presented himself to the Chairman of the Board of Elections of Beaufort County and requested that he be permitted to file as a candidate, for nomination of the Republican Party for Beaufort County's Representative in the Lower House of the General Assembly of North Carolina, in the Primary Election of 26 May 1962.  Plaintiff tendered the filing fee required by law, but was told that he could not lawfully file as a candidate unless he took and subscribed the pledge required by G.S. 163-119, as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;I hereby file my notice as a candidate for the nomination as Representative of Beaufort County in the General Assembly in the Primary Election to be held on the 26th day of May, 1962.  I affiliate with the Republican Party, and I hereby pledge myself to abide by the results of said Primary and to support in the next General&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  Election all candidates nominated by the Republican Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff offered to sign the pledge if permitted to delete the words, &quot;. . . and to support in the next General Election all candidates nominated by the Republican Party.&quot; The Chairman of the County Board refused to accept the altered pledge and refused to permit plaintiff to file unless he signed the pledge as required by the statute.  Plaintiff protested that the pledge prevented the free exercise of the ballot by him and violated rights guaranteed to him by Article I, section 10, of the Constitution of North Carolina, and by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.  Nevertheless, he was not permitted to file without signing the pledge.  Plaintiff filed a petition with the State Board of Elections suggesting the unconstitutionality of the pledge requirement and insisting that it was his right to file without subscribing to the objectionable portion of the pledge.  The State Board denied the petition.  Plaintiff is without an adequate remedy to enforce his fundamental rights.  Plaintiff prays for writ of mandamus &quot;requiring the defendants (Beaufort County Board of Elections, including&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Chairman) to permit the filing of the plaintiff&quot; as candidate for said office &quot;without the necessity of taking that portion of the pledge hereinbefore set out which undertakes to control his vote in the next General Election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants answered and admitted the material factual allegations of the complaint, but denied that plaintiff was entitled to the relief sought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court entered judgment on 11 August 1962, refusing to issue the writ and denying the relief prayed for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff appeals.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record discloses that Flora Elizabeth Wilson is confined in the State Hospital at Butner under an order of indeterminate duration entered by the Clerk Superior Court of Durham County.  The commitment proceeding was initiated on March 21, 1959, by an affidavit of Alfred R. Wilson, Jr., stating, &quot;That Mrs. Flora P. Wilson is (a mentally disordered) person in my opinion and in need of treatment in a proper hospital; . . . that she will not of her own free will permit an examination by physicians.&quot; On the day the affidavit was filed the clerk issued process to the sheriff: &quot;Upon the foregoing affidavit, you are hereby ordered to arrest the above named alleged (mentally disordered) person and her safely keep until proper adjudication can be had.&quot; On April 11, 1959, the clerk issued a notice to Mrs. Wilson that a hearing would be held on April 13, 1959.  The clerk caused Mrs. Wilson to be examined by R. A. Horton and Hans Lowenbach, physicians, each of whom made affidavit that Mrs. Wilson is suffering from mental disease, epilepsy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or inebriety and is a fit subject for admission to a hospital.  The record does not contain an order of commitment, but the record recites that Mrs. Wilson was committed to the State Hospital at Butner on April 21, 1959.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 24, 1959, the Superintendent of State Hospital at Butner notified the Clerk: &quot;It is my opinion she is mentally disordered and in need of further observation and treatment.&quot; The clerk ordered &quot;an observation for four months in addition to the sixty days heretofore ordered.&quot; On October 13, 1959, the Superintendent reported: &quot;Her condition has been essentially the same.  I recommend permanent commitment.&quot; The clerk entered an order on October 14, 1959, that Mrs. Wilson &quot;Be retained in the State Hospital at Butner for care and treatment as prescribed by law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From time to time since the order of permanent commitment Mrs. Wilson has been released on parole for short periods, usually in the custody of her son.  Nothing of note is reported to have occurred during the parole periods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 26, 1961, Mrs. Wilson's daughter filed affidavit that her mother was not a mentally disordered person, not a fit subject for care and treatment in a mental hospital, and that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  her commitment and detention were unlawful.  Upon this affidavit Judge Bickett issued a writ of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">habeas corpus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, returnable at Raleigh, North Carolina, on July 14, 1961.  Judge Copeland conducted a hearing on the writ at which two physicians, specialists in psychiatry, testified that in their opinion Mrs. Wilson is not psychotic and not dangerous to herself or others.  Lay testimony to the same effect was offered.  The respondent, Superintendent of the State Hospital at Butner, identified and presented to Judge Copeland the entire clinical file kept at the hospital, including the results of many staff conferences and findings indicating that Mrs. Wilson was in need of confinement and treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Copeland made the following findings and order:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;1. That the petitioner, Flora Elizabeth Wilson, at the time of her commitment, was a mentally disordered person and a fit subject for care and treatment at a mental hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;2. That on the date of this hearing, the petitioner, Flora Elizabeth Wilson, is a mentally disordered person and a fit subject for care and treatment at a mental hospital and her being at large could be dangerous to herself and others when out of the control&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  and custody of the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;3. That the petitioner, Flora Elizabeth Wilson, was committed and detained in accordance with all the statutory requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;4. That all the orders issued by the Clerk of Superior Court of Durham County are found to be lawful in every respect, and not in violation of the Constitution of North Carolina or the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;5. The Court determines that the North Carolina Statutes under which the petitioner was committed are lawful in every respect and not in violation of the Constitution of the State of North Carolina:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;IT IS THEREFORE CONSIDERED, ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the petition for a writ of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c43">Habeas Corpus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> filed in this case be, and the same is hereby dismissed and the petitioner is remanded to the John Umstead Hospital, Butner, North Carolina, for further care and treatment, as provided by law.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The patient's daughter subsequently filed an affidavit alleging that the patient was not a mentally disordered person and that the patient's commitment and detention were unlawful. The patient filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus claiming that her detention was illegal and that she had been denied her due process rights. The trial court dismissed the petition. On appeal, the court held that the patient was being restrained in violation of her constitutional rights by reason of the lack of notice to the patient and the lack of opportunity for her to be heard on the question of her sanity.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special proceeding for the actual partition of four tracts of land in Pitt County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition, the admissions in the answer, and a stipulation of the parties show these facts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioner, Rufus L. Dudley, and Eva Staton Harris were lawfully married on 7 January 1947.  From then until her death on 14 February 1961 they continuously lived together as man and wife.  They had no children by their marriage.  This was petitioner's second marriage, and Eva Staton Harris's third marriage.  Eva Staton Harris bore only one child, W. Lonnie Staton, a respondent here, by a former marriage.  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">feme</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> respondent is his wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eva Staton Harris Dudley at the time of her death owned in fee simple and was in possession of the four tracts of land described in the petition.  By her last will and testament executed on 28 January 1961 she devised and bequeathed all her property, both real and personal, to her son, W. Lonnie Staton, and made no provision in her will for her husband, petitioner.  Following her death her will was duly probated on 1 May 1961, and appears of record in Will Book 11, page 284, in the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  office of the clerk of the superior court of Pitt County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 1 May 1961, and within the time prescribed by G.S. 30-2, petitioner filed a dissent from the will of his deceased wife.  Thereafter, on 1 February 1962 he commenced this special proceeding for actual partition, alleging that by virtue of his dissent he is the owner of a one-fourth undivided interest in the four tracts of land owned by his deceased wife, and that her son, W. Lonnie Staton, is the owner of a three-fourths undivided interest in the said tracts of land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondents in their answer allege that the provisions of G.S. Chapter 30, Article I, as it was written and in force at the time of Eva Staton Harris Dudley's death on 14 February 1961, insofar as it permits a husband to dissent from his deceased wife's will and take a share of her real and personal property is in conflict with the provisions of Article X, section 6, of our State Constitution, and therefore petitioner owns no interest in the four tracts of land described in the petition, and the respondent, W. Lonnie Staton, owns the said tracts of land in fee simple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the special proceeding came on to be heard before the clerk of the superior court of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pitt County, he adjudged that petitioner and respondent, W. Lonnie Staton, are tenants in common of the four tracts of land described in the petition, petitioner owning a one-fourth undivided interest, and respondent, W. Lonnie Staton, owning a three-fourths undivided interest.  Whereupon, he ordered an actual partition of the four tracts of land.  Respondents appealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the appeal came on to be heard by the judge, the parties stipulated: &quot;The sole question for determination by the court is the constitutionality of Article I, Chapter 30 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, pertaining to and giving the surviving spouse the right of dissent from the will of his or her deceased spouse.&quot; The judge held that the right of dissent given by G.S., Article I, Chapter 30, is in all respects constitutional, and affirmed the clerk's order.  Whereupon, he remanded the special proceeding to the clerk to the end that actual partition be had according to law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the judgment entered by the judge, respondents appeal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Respondents, heir and his wife, appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Pitt County (North Carolina) that affirmed the clerk adjudging that the heir and petitioner husband were tenants in common of land that the testatrix had devised solely to the heir. Also, the superior court held that the husband's right of dissent pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. art. I, ch. 30 was not unconstitutional in light of N.C. Const. art. X, &sect; 6 (1868).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The testatrix devised all of her real property to the heir, her son from a prior marriage. The husband pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 30-1, 30-2, 30-3 dissented. The heir and his wife argued that N.C. Const. art. X, &sect; 6 (1868) made N.C. Gen. Stat. art. I, ch. 30 unconstitutional. The court agreed and reversed the judgment that granted the husband an ownership interest in the devise of land to the heir. N.C. Const. art. X, &sect; 6 provided that a female who acquired real and personal property before or after marriage was her sole and separate estate and property, and she could devise and bequeath that property as if she was unmarried. Section 6 abolished the common law doctrine that as to property the husband and wife were one person with the husband exercising all power with respect thereto. The court held that &sect; 6 was unambiguous and the legislature could not abridge the protection afforded to the testatrix.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court reversed the judgment that held the husband and heir were tenants in common to land devised by the testatrix to the heir, and that held the statute which gave the husband the right of dissent was not unconstitutional.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These appeals present for determination the constitutionality of statutes enacted in 1959 establishing a firemen's pension fund and a source necessary for the support and maintenance thereof by a tax on fire and lightning insurance premiums.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiffs brought action to determine constitutionality of a 1959 statute that permitted defendant to tax fire and lightning insurance policies sold by plaintiffs in order to provide retirement pensions for firemen. Plaintiffs failed in obtaining such declaratory judgment, paid the taxes assessed by defendant, and filed a demand for refund. Refund was denied, thus appeal followed. The court stated that a fundamental principle in law of taxation was that taxes may only be levied for public purposes and for the benefit of public, on whom such taxes were imposed. Such tax imposed upon insurance companies was compared to levying a tax on all male citizens between the ages of 18 and 45, who had not served in the Armed Forces, to provide required funds for pensions of those who actually served. Thus, statute in question was declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was originally indicted and put on trial for the charge of an assault with intent to commit rape.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The prosecution sought the dismissal of the original charge after the testimony of the victim in the trial revealed that defendant could be prosecuted and convicted of rape. The trial court ordered a mistrial upon the prosecution's motion to dismiss. After defendant was indicted for rape, he entered a plea of former jeopardy. The court reversed the trial court's decision to not grant the plea. The offense of assault with intent to commit rape was a lesser degree of the offense of rape, when based on the same occurrence, and the two offenses defendant was charged with were the same in fact and in law. The court ruled that jeopardy attached when the trial court granted the prosecutor's motion for a mistrial at the first trial. The court found that &quot;physical necessity&quot; and &quot;necessity for doing justice&quot; were not present to justify the mistrial, and the trial court could have proceeded to verdict and judgment in the first prosecution in a fair, orderly, and legal manner. The mistrial was not in the &quot;furtherance of justice,&quot; but was obviously unjust because defendant was thereby exposed to punishment for a higher degree of the offense charged, which was a capital offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court reversed defendant's conviction for rape from the trial court. The trial court was ordered to vacate the judgment, set aside the verdict of guilty, and discharge defendant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff, Piedmont Canteen Service, Inc. (hereinafter called &quot;Piedmont&quot;) is a North Carolina corporation, having its principal office in Greensboro, North Carolina.  It sells at retail within this State cigarettes, bakery products, candy, bottled drinks and coffee through coin operated automatic vending machines.  It leases the machines from Automatic Canteen Company of America (hereinafter called &quot;Automatic&quot;), of Chicago, Illinois.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Auditors of the North Carolina Department of Revenue examined Piedmont's records for the period 10 June 1956 to 11 April 1959 and on 15 May 1959 proposed an assessment of additional sales and use taxes.  On 26 June 1959 Piedmont protested the proposed assessment and was granted a hearing before the Commissioner of Revenue on 29 September 1959.  The Commissioner sustained the assessments, authorized waiver of penalty, and notified Piedmont on 25 July 1960.  Piedmont gave notice of intention to petition the Tax Review Board for administrative review in accordance with G.S. 105-241.2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Piedmont abandoned its application for administrative review and on 22 August 1960 paid under&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  protest the sales and use tax assessments claimed by the Commissioner, and demanded refund.

The corporation argued that a supplemental rental it paid to the lessor of the vending machines was a service charge, but the tax commissioner argued that it was rent for the use of the vending machines and was subject to the use tax. On appeal the court found that the supplemental rental was payment for the use of the machines and the exercise of the franchise in North Carolina, and the supplemental rental was properly subjected to the use tax. With regard to the sales tax, the corporation argued that items priced at less than 10 cents each and sold through vending machines were nontaxable because of the low unit price. The court found that pursuant to the bracket system of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-164.10, a retailer was required to collect from a purchaser no amount on sales of less than 10 cents. However, the statute pertained to the total purchase price, and not the unit price of individual goods. Therefore, if several items of less than 10 cents were sold, a tax was due on the total purchase price.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff's action, instituted under the Declaratory Judgment Act (G.S. 1-253&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), is to declare invalid and to enjoin the enforcement, insofar as it prohibits the peddling of ice milk or ice cream by mobile units, this portion of Section 105, Chapter 14, of the City Code of Raleigh, to wit:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No ice cream shall be peddled along the streets and/or sidewalks of the city from push carts or other vehicles or in any other manner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff is a North Carolina Corporation with principal office in Raleigh.  Its business includes the sale of ice milk (in the form of cones, sandwiches, milk shakes, sundaes and in packages) from mobile freezer units along the streets and highways of North Carolina.  On or about May 11, 1961, plaintiff, desiring to sell and dispense said products to the public from such freezer unit along the streets of Raleigh, applied to the City Collector of Revenue for a peddler's license and tendered the prescribed fee.  The City Collector refused to issue such license.  Thereafter, on May 15, 1961, plaintiff presented its request to the City Council.  The City Council, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  based solely on the quoted portion of Section 105, Chapter 14, of the City Code, denied plaintiff's request and refused to order the issuance of such license.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the pleadings, plaintiff attacked the quoted ordinance provision as unauthorized and unconstitutional, and defendant asserted its validity as an authorized and constitutional exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties waived jury trial.  G.S. 1-184.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff offered evidence describing its one-ton Chevrolet mobile units; the manner in which it now operates thirty-seven such units in its franchise area; the precautions taken to prevent injury, such as construction so that customers can be served only on the right-hand or curb side, the display of caution signs and careful operation at slow speed; and its record of safe operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's evidence consisted of the testimony of witnesses who had observed the operation of similar mobile units (but not those of plaintiff) in other towns and communities.  In substance, this testimony was to the effect that the approach of such mobile unit, announced by the ringing of bells or other signal, causes young children to become excited and (absent advance arrangement) press their&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  parents for money to make purchases; that children hurry to (crossing streets) and congregate about the place where such mobile unit is parked; and that the approach of such mobile unit and its special appeal to small children in the manner indicated creates a hazard to them and to other persons and traffic lawfully using the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After hearing the evidence, the court made findings of fact, conclusions of law and entered judgment as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;1. That the operation of mobile ice cream dispensing units attracts children into the public streets and constitutes a menace to the public safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;2. That assembly of people in the public streets for the purpose of purchasing products dispensed by mobile ice cream units impedes or tends to impede motor vehicle traffic upon the public streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;3. That the ordinance attacked by the plaintiff in this action does not discriminate against persons in the same class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;4. That the ordinance prohibiting the peddling of ice cream on the streets of Raleigh has a substantial relation to the preservation of the public safety but not to the public health.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Upon the foregoing findings of fact, the Court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  makes the following Conclusions of Law:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;1. That the ordinance does not violate any constitutional provision and is a valid exercise of the legislative powers conferred upon the City of Raleigh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;JUDGMENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Upon the foregoing findings of fact and conclusions of law, it is considered, ordered and adjudged that the ordinance which is the subject of this action is a valid ordinance, and this action is dismissed at the cost to the Plaintiff.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The regulation of such sales was contained in the city's license tax provision. That law, found in City of Raleigh, N.C., Code ch. 14, &sect; 104, was nearly identical to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-97 except the amount of the tax was different and the State statute did not contain the prohibition against ice cream sales on streets as did the city's ordinance. The trial court dismissed the company's declaratory action and ruled that the ordinance was valid. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and ruled that the provision of the ordinance prohibiting the sale of ice cream products on streets was invalid because it conflicted with &sect; 105-97 that legalized and sanctioned such sales. The court did not invalidate the remaining portions of the ordinance relating to license taxes for peddlers engaged in selling goods, wares, or merchandise.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant was tried in the recorder's court of the city of Wilson on a warrant charging a violation of G.S. 14-72.1, enacted by the General Assembly, Session Laws 1957, Chapter 301.  The warrant charges the offense in substantial accord with the words of the statute, and alleges in substance that the defendant on 3 September 1960, without authority, did unlawfully and wilfully conceal on or about her person the goods and merchandise of McLellan's Stores Company in the city of Wilson, to wit, 4 boys' T shirts (2 sizes 6 and 2 sizes 8) valued at $ 100 each, and one pair of girl's white shoes valued at $ 2.98, not theretofore purchased by her, while still upon the premises of the store.  It seems patent that the charged value of the T shirts at $ 100 each is wrong, and that it should be $ 1.00 each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the recorder's court the defendant entered a plea of Not Guilty.  She was found guilty, and fined $ 25.00 and the costs.  From the judgment she appealed to the superior court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the case came on for trial in the superior court the defendant demurred to the warrant and moved that it be quashed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the following grounds: One, the offense alleged is not based on a violation of the common law.  Two, G.S. 14-72.1 is unconstitutional, because it violates Article I, Section 17, of the North Carolina Constitution, for that G.S. 14-72.1, which attempts to prohibit shoplifting, which is common law larceny, does not require any felonious intent on the part of the person, who, without authority, wilfully conceals, the goods and merchandise of a store, not theretofore purchased by such person, while still upon the premises of such store, and that the provision of the statute which provides &quot;such goods or merchandise found concealed upon or about the person and which have not theretofore been purchased by such person shall be prima facie evidence of a willful concealment,&quot; does not require a felonious intent, and because the statute does not inform the defendant with reasonable precision of the act it prohibits; and further because the statute is so general and indefinite that it is void for uncertainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court allowed the motion to quash, and the State, by virtue of G.S. 15-179, appealed to the Supreme Court.  </SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-72.1 after defendant pleaded guilty to the offense in the recorder's court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The state charged defendant with shoplifting in violation of &sect; 14-72.1, and after defendant pleaded guilty to the charge, she demurred to the warrant and filed a motion to quash it. The superior court allowed the motion to quash. On appeal, the court reversed and found that there was no merit to defendant's claim that &sect; 14-72.1 was not based on a violation of common law. The court held that &sect; 14-72.1 did not violate N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 or the Due Process Clauses because the N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-72.1 was neither overly broad nor vague. The court found that &sect; 14-72.1 defined with sufficient clarity and definiteness the acts that were penalized and that the statute informed a person of ordinary intelligence with reasonable precision what acts it intended to prohibit so that defendant would know the acts to avoid in order to avoid being penalized. No essential provisions were omitted from the &sect; 14-72.1, and the shoplifting statute was sufficiently definite to guide a judge in its application and a lawyer in defending a person charged with violating it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action to enjoin defendants &quot;from proceeding with the construction of Carver College&quot; and &quot;from the payment of public money for such construction of Carver College.&quot; At the hearing on plaintiffs' application for a temporary restraining order, defendants demurred to the complaint for that, on grounds distinctly specified, the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allegations of the complaint (exclusive of the prayer for relief) are set forth in fifty-one numbered paragraphs.  Plaintiffs' said allegations, summarized or quoted, are stated below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs are citizens, residents and taxpayers of Mecklenburg County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Trustees of the Charlotte Community College System&quot; is a body corporate organized and existing under authority of G.S. 116-47 through G.S. 116-62.  The individual defendants (hereafter referred to as the trustees) are the duly constituted trustees of the Charlotte Community College System, hereafter called &quot;College System.&quot; The College System, as administered by said trustees, &quot;is presently comprised of two separate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and distinct college units,&quot; to wit, Charlotte College and Carver College, with student enrollments of 696 and 261, respectively, for the fall term of 1960.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlotte College and Carver College have been operated as segregated colleges for members of the white and Negro races, respectively.  The classes of Charlotte College have been held in a public school building &quot;formerly occupied by school children substantially all of which were of the white race.&quot; The classes of Carver College have been held in a public school building &quot;now and formerly occupied by school children of the Negro race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trustees have purchased or acquired two tracts of land: (1) A tract of 267 acres, for the location and construction of Charlotte College, &quot;in a substantially rural area away from areas primarily populated by members of the Negro race&quot;; and (2) a tract of 50 acres for the location and construction of Carver College, &quot;situated adjacent to an area populated primarily by members of the Negro race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 8, 1960, &quot;pursuant to an election duly authorized by law, the citizens and residents of Mecklenburg County, State of North Carolina, authorized, by a majority of those qualified and voting, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the issuance by Mecklenburg County, State of North Carolina, of $ 975,000.00 in bonds and a special increase in county taxes to repay the principal and interest on said bonds and said bonds to be designated as Charlotte Community College bonds, with the proceeds to be used by the Charlotte Community College System for construction of new campuses for Charlotte College and Carver College.&quot; The bonds so authorized &quot;have been sold, or are about to be sold, and money has been placed, or is about to be placed, at the disposal of the defendant trustees for the purpose of constructing two new college sites for Charlotte College and Carver College to serve as Community Colleges in accordance with the terms of North Carolina General Statutes 116-47 to 116-62.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tax on all taxable property, including real and personal property owned by plaintiffs, will be specifically increased by an amount sufficient to pay the principal and interest on said bonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approximately $ 287,000.00 of the funds from said bond issue have been allocated &quot;for construction of initial buildings and grounds of Carver College.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">J. N. Pease &amp; Company, Inc., and Dickerson, Inc., North Carolina corporations, have contracts&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for the construction of the initial portion of the proposed Carver College campus.  When this action was instituted (May 15, 1961), &quot;only a small amount of work (had) begun under said contracts, in that only a small amount of grading, piping, and footings (had) been begun or completed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Charlotte College catalogue for 1960-1961 (Exhibit B) states &quot;a correlated program in cooperation with North Carolina State College has been developed whereby a student may complete the first two years of engineering at Charlotte College and then transfer to North Carolina State College for the final two years, if qualified.&quot; North Carolina State College, supported by public funds and located in Raleigh, North Carolina, has &quot;a faculty, administration, and student body substantially all of which being members of the white race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Carver College catalogue for 1960-1961 (Exhibit A) states: &quot;Arrangements have been made between Carver College and the Agricultural and Technical College of Greensboro, North Carolina for a four-year co-operative program in engineering.  The first two years of the program may be completed at Carver College and then the student may transfer to the Agricultural and Technical&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  College to complete the final two years of the undergraduate work in the same branch of engineering provided the grades are satisfactory.&quot; Agricultural and Technical College, supported by public funds and located in Greensboro, North Carolina, has &quot;a faculty, administrative personnel, and students, all, or substantially all, being members of the Negro race.&quot; Exhibit A also states: &quot;Should serious illness occur during the school day, students are referred to the school physician or taken to Good Samaritan Hospital.&quot; Good Samaritan Hospital, one of four major general hospitals in Charlotte, &quot;is the only one of said general hospitals operated exclusively for members of the Negro race regularly admitting only Negro patients.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlotte College and Carver College &quot;are substantially similar with respect to general purpose and general curriculum each being a substantial duplication of the other with respect to the general type of courses offered, except that a greater number of courses are offered at Charlotte College than at Carver College.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If both college units are constructed, Charlotte College, upon completion of its new campus, will continue to be operated by said trustees &quot;as a segregated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or largely segregated institution for members of the white race, with the faculty, instructors, administrative personnel, and regularly enrolled students substantially all being members of the white race&quot;; and Carver College, upon completion of its new campus, will continue to be operated &quot;as a segregated institution for members of the Negro race, with the faculty, instructors, administrative personnel and students all being members of the Negro race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large majority of students attending these colleges will reside in Mecklenburg County, will have received their preparatory training from the Charlotte and Mecklenburg County public school system, which is to all intents and purposes &quot;a racially segregated public school system.&quot; If both proposed college units are constructed, &quot;the graduates of the largely segregated public school system of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County will feed into a segregated Charlotte Community College System, the result of which will be an unlawful perpetuation of racial segregation of the Charlotte Community College System with the full support of the State of North Carolina.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The said trustees, in their official capacity under authority of and in behalf&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the State of North Carolina, &quot;have set upon a course of conduct to construct two separate colleges comprising the Charlotte Community College System which will have the effect of maintaining and perpetuating completely or substantially racially segregated publicly supported colleges within the said System.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The said trustees &quot;have set upon a course of conduct whereby a library, eating areas, classroom facilities, athletic areas and administrative areas will be constructed at Charlotte College to be used as facilities of said college, all costing hundreds of thousands of dollars of public funds&quot;; and &quot;whereby a library, eating areas, classroom facilities, athletic areas and administrative areas will be constructed at Carver College to be used as facilities of said college, all costing hundreds of thousands of dollars of public funds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The said trustees, &quot;by reason of their aforesaid duplication or proposed duplication of facilities and services are acting in a manner which amounts to a manifest abuse of their discretion resulting in a greatly increased cost for such total facilities and therefore a needless waste of public funds and taxpayers' money.&quot; &quot;. . . the construction of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  only one college facility under the Charlotte Community College System would be adequate and sufficient and would more efficiently discharge the purpose of the System.&quot; The tract of land obtained for the construction of Charlotte College (267 acres) contains &quot;adequate area in which to construct needed facilities for all students enrolled in the Charlotte Community College System,&quot; and &quot;full utilization of said tract of land would more easily and efficiently discharge the purpose of the Community College System and save hundreds of thousands of dollars of public money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs allege they &quot;bring this action as taxpayers of Mecklenburg County, State of North Carolina, and in behalf of all other taxpayers of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, similarly situated, for an order enjoining the spending of public funds for the construction and operation of Carver College, a part of the Charlotte Community College System operating under the act hereinabove referred to, on the ground that such expenditure would be for the unconstitutional and thereby illegal purpose of continuing and operating a racially segregated public college facility in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Constitution of the United States and on the ground that North Carolina General Statutes 116-47 to 116-62, as administered by the defendant trustees in their official capacity is in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, and on the ground that such expenditure of public funds would be a waste of taxpayers' money brought about by a manifest abuse of discretion of the defendant trustees acting in their official capacity.&quot; Plaintiffs allege they have no adequate remedy at law and that they, as taxpayers, will suffer irreparable injury if the injunctive relief they seek is not granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judgment, sustaining defendants' said demurrer and dismissing the action, was entered.  Plaintiffs excepted and appealed.  </SPAN></P>

The taxpayers brought an action to enjoin the spending of public funds for the second college, arguing that the expenditure would be for the unconstitutional purpose of operating a racially segregated public college in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court entered a judgment sustaining defendants' demurrer challenging the sufficiency of the complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed. N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 116-49 authorized the trustees to establish a college consisting of two units. The taxpayers did not allege that they would be affected by the construction differently from all other property owners in the county. A constitutional question could not be raised by one whose rights were not directly affected, and it was not alleged that any student was or would be excluded from either of the two units.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action was begun on 12 April 1961 when plaintiff filed his complaint alleging the charter of the City of Wilson as amended in 1957 prescribing the manner for electing city officials was unconstitutional and void, adversely affecting plaintiff's rights as an elector and candidate for the office of city commissioner at an election to be held on 2 May 1961.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governing officials of the city are, by charter provision, a mayor and six commissioners.  Nonpartisan elections are held in May in odd numbered years for the election of these city officials.  Commissioners are elected at large by qualified voters of the city.  A single ballot is provided containing the names of all who have given notice of their candidacy for the office of commissioner.  The six candidates receiving the highest number of votes are the elected commissioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 3 of the Act of 1957 amending the charter provides: &quot;No ballot for Commissioners shall be valid unless as many candidates shall be voted for as there are vacancies to be filled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff alleged: He was a candidate for the office of commissioner at the election&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to be held on 2 May 1961; he and many other electors were unwilling to comply with the requirements of the city charter and vote for a sufficient number of candidates to fill all vacancies; election officials would treat as invalid and refuse to count those ballots where the elector did not vote for six commissioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He asked the court to declare the statute requiring electors to vote for six commissioners void, and for an order requiring the officials to show cause why they should not be enjoined from complying with the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The motion for the restraining order was presented to Judge Carr 21 April 1961.  He, on that date, issued an order directing defendants to appear on 25 April before Judge Stevens, regularly assigned to hold the courts of the Seventh District.  Judge Stevens heard the parties but declined to enjoin compliance with the statute.  The election was held in accord with the statutory provision.  The official ballot contained thirteen names, including plaintiff's.  It informed electors:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. To vote for a candidate on the ballot make a cross x mark in the square at the left of his name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. For legal ballot, vote for six candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. If you tear or deface&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or wrongfully mark this ballot, return it to registrar and get another.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election officials declared the six whose names were marked on ballots conforming to the statute duly elected.  They received 2036, 1897, 1885, 1835, 1831, and 1332 votes respectively on complete ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff received a total of 211 votes on complete ballots, that is, ballots for six commissioners.  There were a total of 761 ballots not counted for any commissioner because of the failure of the elector to vote for the requisite number.  Plaintiff's name appeared upon a substantial number of the 761 ballots not counted.  Other names also appeared on the 761 ballots not counted, but on none of them as many as six names appeared.  Subsequent to the election, plaintiff moved the court to declare the election void and the quoted statutory provision invalid because of asserted conflict with sections 10 and 37 of Art.  I and sections 1 and 6 of Art.  VI of the North Carolina Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the hearing the parties stipulated the facts as summarized above.  Judge Stevens, being of the opinion that the Act was constitutional, dismissed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the action.  Plaintiff appealed.  </SPAN></P>

On 7 March 1960 the Board of County Commissioners of Mecklenburg County adopted a resolution accepting for Mecklenburg County &quot;all of the provisions of Article 14A of the General Statutes of North Carolina providing for the appointment of Justices of the Peace by the Resident Judge and the abolition of the fee system.&quot; The resolution provided for 41 justices&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the peace: 2 for service in the County Recorder's Court, 12 for service in the county rural police force, 13 for service in the Charlotte City police force, 3 for service in the City Recorder's Court, 3 for service in the Domestic Relations Court, and 8 for general trial service in Mecklenburg County.  The terms of office were fixed at 2 years, to begin in December 1960.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. On 11 July 1960 a budget resolution was adopted by the Board of Commissioners appropriating $ 33,995.00 from the County's general fund for payment of salaries and expenses of justices of the peace for 7 months, December 1960 to June 1961, inclusive.  The authorized number of trial justices of the peace was reduced from 8 to 5, with recommendation that the number be held to 3 unless it appear that a greater number is needed.  Salaries for trial justices were fixed at $ 6,000 each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Judge Clarkson has announced that he will make the appointments in conformity with the resolutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint alleges that Article 14A, Chapter 7, of the General Statutes of North Carolina (G.S. 7-120.1 to G.S. 7-120.11, inclusive) is unconstitutional, the appointment of justices of the peace pursuant to this article would&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be unlawful, payment of their salaries from the general fund would constitute an unauthorized and unlawful expenditure of public funds and would irreparably injure plaintiff and the other taxpayers of Mecklenburg County.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The taxpayer was a resident of the county, who sought to restrain the appointment of, and payment of salaries to, JPs under &sect;&sect; 7-120.1 to 7-120.11. The court reversed the trial court's decision granting judgment for the county. The court determined that the taxpayer had standing to challenge the appointment of JPs despite the fact that he had not been before a JP because their activities vitally affected the business and social life of the community. The court held that the office of JP was constitutional in origin and existence. JPs were not subject to local supervision. The North Carolina Constitution prohibited and rendered void all local, private, or special legislation relating to appointment of JPs. The court determined that &sect;&sect; 7-120.1 to 7-120.11 was a local and special statute. The statute was applicable to only 28 counties. The counties did not constitute an inherent and reasonable class or classification as distinct from the JPs and appointive methods in the other counties. There was no evidence that other methods of appointment were less desirable for the 28 counties than the methods used in the rest of the state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs allege they own certain cattle on Shackleford Banks; that defendant Salter, as Sheriff, pursuant to an order of the Board of Commissioners of Carteret County, is threatening to destroy or to remove plaintiffs' said cattle; that defendant Salter and Carteret County assert their threatened action is authorized by Chapter 1057, Session Laws of 1957, and Chapter 782, Session Laws of 1959; that said 1957 and 1959 statutes are unconstitutional; and that said defendants should be enjoined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs, asserting their action is brought under the Declaratory Judgment Act, G.S. 1-253&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et. seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, &quot;and for affirmative relief,&quot; served the Attorney General with a copy of the proceeding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The cattle owners sought an injunction to restrain defendants from destroying or removing their cattle from the banks. In their complaint, the cattle owners challenged the constitutionality of the 1957 Act and the 1959 Act under which defendants claimed they had the authority to remove or destroy the cattle. The trial court dismissed the cattle owners' complaint. On appeal, the court vacated the dismissal order and remanded the case for entry of an injunction against defendants. The sole ground on which a forfeiture and confiscation of the cattle could have been sustained was that they were running at large in violation of the 1957 Act and thus constituted a public nuisance. However, the 1957 Act did not provide for such forfeiture and confiscation. The 1959 Act was a local act relating to the abatement of a public nuisance, and because it provided no procedure for a judicial determination as to whether the cattle constituted a public nuisance, it was unconstitutional. Since the 1959 Act was unconstitutional, defendants had no authority to destroy or remove the cattle, and the cattle owners were entitled to an injunction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a civil action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff, Nancy Bazemore, is a Negro, 47 years of age, and for many years has resided within the boundaries of Woodville Township voting precinct, Bertie County.  On 14 May 1960 she applied to the registrar of that precinct to register as an elector.  The books were open for registration.  As a qualifying test the registrar required her to write, from his reading and dictation, a portion of the Constitution of North Carolina.  When the test was completed the registrar declared that she was not qualified to register and declined to list her as an elector in the precinct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In apt time and in compliance with the pertinent statute plaintiff appealed to the Bertie County Board of Elections.  All members of the Board were present when the appeal was heard.  Plaintiff was present in person and represented by counsel.  The Board offered to test her ability &quot;to read and write any section of the Constitution of North Carolina in the English language.&quot; A member of the Board began to read a section of the State Constitution and requested plaintiff to write it from his dictation.  Upon&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  advice of counsel she declined to take this test.  Thereupon, the Board refused registration because she would not submit to this test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court.  Defendant, Board of Elections, moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that plaintiff refused to submit to the test offered by the Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court made findings of fact.  Those essential to this appeal are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the hearing before the Board &quot;the plaintiff took a seat at the table opposite the members of the said Bertie County Board of Elections preparatory to writing; . . . a member of the Board then began to read in a clear and reasonable tone of voice and at a reasonably slow rate of speed a section of the Constitution of North Carolina to the said Nancy Bazemore who was requested to write as the same was being read to her, . . . that she failed and neglected at said time to take and submit to the reasonable test offered and begun to be administered to her upon the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hearing before said board.  . . . (T)he . . . Board . . . decided that her appeal should be denied and registration refused . . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff applicant appealed from the judgment of the Bertie County Superior Court (North Carolina) that granted the motion of defendant Bertie County Board of Elections to dismiss her appeal from the Board's refusal to register her to vote on grounds that she had failed and neglected to submit to a dictated literacy test under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 163-28.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The applicant was a black woman and the registrar refused to list her as an elector upon ruling that she had not passed a qualifying literacy test. The applicant appealed to the Board, which required her to write sections of the state constitution, as read and dictated by a member of the Board. The applicant refused, so the Board rejected her application. The superior court dismissed her appeal. In reversing on review, the supreme court ruled that &sect; 163-28 required only the ability to read and write a section of the state constitution and the Board had no authority to require that the applicant take the dictation of a member reading the state constitution. Moreover, &sect; 163-28 did not require perfection or the utmost proficiency in the reading and writing. However, the literacy test requirement under &sect; 163-28 was generally constitutional because it was applicable to members of all races and was related to a legitimate goal of promoting the intelligent use of the ballot. The right of suffrage was not a necessary attribute of citizenship, but was subject to state regulation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Error was found and the case was remanded with directions to order the local registrar to administer the test to the applicant in the manner provided in the opinion, and to duly register her if she were found to be qualified.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff alleged in substance (1) that he is a resident and taxpayer of the Town of Murphy, a municipal corporation in Cherokee County, North Carolina -- population more than 500, fewer than 5,000.  Additional allegations form the basis of the demand for relief:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;4. That recently, and during the year 1960, said Town of Murphy, by and through its Mayor and Council, and upon a petition as required by law, duly and regularly and pursuant to the 'Housing Authorities Law' of the State of North Carolina, Chapter 456, Public Laws of North Carolina 1935, and amendments thereto, and Chapter 1281 of the 1959 Session Laws of the General Assembly of North Carolina as hereinabove set out, established and created a 'Housing Authority of the City of Murphy' and appointed Merle Davis, W. D. Townson, Frank Mauney and J. G.

G. Greene was killed in an automobile accident and this vacancy has not been filled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;5. That the defendants, C. L. Alverson, W. D. Townson, Merle Davis and Frank Mauney now claimed to be public officers and to hold a public office as members of said 'Housing Authority of the City of Murphy' and as such have and are conducting business and duties of said office under the provisions of Chapter 456 of the Public Laws of 1935, and amendments thereto, the same being Chapter 157 of the General Statutes of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;6. That as the plaintiff is advised, informed and believes said Chapter 1281 of the Session Laws of the 1959 General Assembly of North Carolina which is hereinabove set out and which rewrites G.S. 157-3(2) and particularly the portion thereof which provides: 'That in Alleghany, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c43">Cherokee</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">, Clay, Graham, Hertford, Macon, Swain, Transylvania, Jackson, Haywood, Madison, Buncombe, Henderson, and Polk Counties a city shall mean any city or town having a population of more than five hundred (500) inhabitants according to the last Federal Census or revision of amendment thereto,' is violative of Article II, Section 29&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  of the North Carolina Constitution and is unconstitutional and invalid because it pertains to public health and is local in nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;7. That the defendants, C.L. Alverson, W. D. Townson, Merle Davis and Frank Mauney are unlawfully holding and exercising a public office as members of 'Housing Authority of the City of Murphy' because Chapter 1281 of 1959 Session Laws of the General Assembly of North Carolina is unconstitutional and invalid, as hereinabove alleged, and the Town of Murphy had no authority to create a Housing Authority for the City of Murphy under the Laws of the State of North Carolina.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff prayed for the following relief:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;1. That Chapter 1281 of the Session Laws of the 1959 General Assembly of North Carolina amending G.S. 157-3(2) is unconstitutional and invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;2. That the defendants be adjudged as unlawfully holding and exercising a public office as members of the 'Housing Authority of the City of Murphy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants filed a joint answer in which they alleged that they are holding office as members of the &quot;Housing Authority of the City of Murphy,&quot; by virtue of Chapter 456, Public Laws, Session 1935, and amendments thereto, including&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chapter 1281, Session Laws of 1959, all enacted by the North Carolina General Assembly pursuant to and in accordance with its lawful authority under the Constitution of North Carolina.  All other allegations of the complaint are admitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties stipulated:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. That the allegations of paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8 of the complaint and petition for Declaratory Judgment filed in this proceeding are true and constitute the facts before the Court for its consideration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed a judgment of the Cherokee Superior Court, which rendered judgment that 1959 N.C. Sess. Laws 1281 was constitutional and that defendant municipal officers were lawfully holding office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The taxpayer alleged that the municipality established a municipal housing authority and appointed officers of the authority. Prior to the enactment of 1959 N.C. Sess. Laws 1281, the Housing Authority Act did not authorize the municipality, which had a population under 5,000, to establish a housing authority. Therefore, if 1959 N.C. Sess. Laws 1281 was unconstitutional as alleged by the taxpayer, the housing authority was a nullity. Addressing the alleged constitutionality of the amendment, the court observed that courts were reluctant to hold invalid any act of the general assembly. Courts would not declare void an act of the legislature unless the question of its constitutionality was presented and it was found necessary to do so to protect rights guaranteed by the constitution. Accordingly, only an injured party could assail the validity of a statute. The court concluded that, as a taxpayer, plaintiff was not entitled to bring the action. He did not allege that public money had been or was to be expended or taxes had been or were to be levied. Nor had the taxpayer alleged that his rights had been invaded by the housing authority or by the individual officers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By agreement of the parties plaintiff's right to recover was made to depend on facts summarized and quoted as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) Plaintiff is a domestic corporation with offices in Lenoir, Statesville, Hendersonville, Elkin, and Forest City, N. C.  &quot;The plaintiff is engaged in the business of an installment paper dealer as defined in subsection (a) of Section 105-83 of the General Statutes of North Carolina and is generally engaged in the auto finance business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) The provisions of G.S. 105-83 are quoted as a part of the stipulated facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) &quot;Many of the State and National Banks in North Carolina are installment paper dealers as defined by said statute and are engaged in the auto finance business, in addition to their other activities, in substantial competition with the plaintiff and other non-bank installment paper dealers, and are doing a substantial volume of the installment paper dealer business in North&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Carolina.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) Plaintiff, an installment paper dealer and auto finance company, pays to North Carolina franchise, license, intangible, sales, and income taxes, and pays to the counties and cities in which it operates </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ad valorem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> taxes on its real and personal property.  The taxes paid include the taxes levied pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 105-83.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(5) Plaintiff made the reports required by subsection (b) of G.S. 105-83 for the quarter ending 30 September 1959 and paid under protest $ 1911.36 as taxes imposed by said subsection, based on the report so made.  The amount so paid was in addition to the tax levied pursuant to subsection (a) of G.S. 105-83.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(6) Within thirty days after payment plaintiff made written demand for refund.  The demand was rejected.  Plaintiff then instituted this action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(7) Banks doing business in North Carolina, including national banking associations, are required by G.S. 105-228.12 to pay an excise tax equal to 4 1/2% of their net income.  The tax levied pursuant to that section is, by G.S. 105-228.13, in lieu of State intangible property, franchise, and income taxes, and taxes levied on tangible personal property by local taxing jurisdictions. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  State banks also pay the fees authorized by G.S. 53-122.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(8) National banks are taxed by North Carolina to the extent and manner permitted by Title 12, USCA, sec. 548.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(9) The tax imposed by North Carolina General Statutes 105-83 on installment paper dealers is not imposed upon State or National banks, though many of them are also installment paper dealers in addition to their other activities, and by virtue of the provisions of Title 12 USCA, Section 548, such a tax may not be imposed upon National banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(10) A substantial number of State and National Banks doing business in North Carolina engage in the business of installment paper dealers as defined in G.S. 105-83, in addition to their other activities, as do the plaintiff and other non-bank installment paper dealers.  All such installment paper dealers, banks and non-banks engage in substantially identical operations with respect to their installment paper business, which do not differ in any material respect, either as to the methods and mechanics of acquiring installment paper, or as to the business arrangements with the automobile dealers, or as to the rates charged, or as to the type of paper bought, or otherwise.  In&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  general and in detail, the conduct of installment paper dealer business in North Carolina is and was at all times mentioned in the Complaint the same in all substantial and material respects, as engaged in and carried on by State and National banks and the plaintiff and other non-bank installment paper dealers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(11) In a substantial number of banks this installment paper dealer business is handled by a separate department of the bank commonly known as an Installment Loan Department or as a Time Payment Department, often in an office or building entirely separate from the main bank building, and the records, bookkeeping and management personnel in such department devote their full time exclusively to the contracting for, acquisition of, collecting of, servicing of this installment paper and to other work incident to this phase of the bank's operations and the same is substantially identical to the operations of non-bank installment paper dealers.  Many of the banks maintaining Installment Loan Departments or Time Payment departments keep these departments open beyond regular banking hours to conform to hours maintained by the plaintiff and other non-bank installment paper dealers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;(12) It is further agreed that no facts other than those stated hereinabove are material or necessary to the decision of this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(13) The question involved in this case is whether or not G.S., Section 105-83 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, is unlawfully discriminatory and unconstitutional.  If so, the plaintiff is entitled to recover of the defendant the sum of $ 1,911.36 with interest; and, if not, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court, being of the opinion that the statute is not unlawfully discriminatory or unconstitutional as applied to plaintiff, adjudged it take nothing.  Plaintiff appealed.  </SPAN></P>

After making a written demand for refund and being rejected, the taxpayer initiated an action claiming that the statute was unconstitutional because it exempted banks, which were also engaged in the auto finance business. The trial court found that the taxpayer could not recover and that the statute was valid. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that &sect; 105-83 was not discriminatory or unconstitutional. Because the validity of a tax statute was challenged on the ground of discrimination, the court had to ascertain if in fact there was a difference in the classes taxed. The installment paper dealer and the banks were each defined by statute, and the court found that the businesses were not identical. The court stated that the legislature, in providing funds for governmental needs, had a right to recognize the distinctions in its classification of the businesses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeal was docketed at the 1960 Fall Term as Case No. 458.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action instituted 16 December 1959 by plaintiffs Insurance Companies pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act to test the validity and constitutionality of Chapters 1211, 1212 and 1273 of the Session Laws of 1959 and, in the alternative, to have Chapter 1211 construed in the event it is declared constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">After the state legislature passed several acts relating to taxes to be imposed on certain types of insurance companies, plaintiff insurance companies brought an action under the North Carolina Declaratory Judgment Act, N.C.

Defendants, the state insurance commissioner and the board of a state firemen's pension fund, demurred to the complaint, which the trial court sustained. The appellate court affirmed, holding the Declaratory Judgment Act was not the proper method for challenging tax statutes. Plaintiffs' suit against the insurance commissioner and pension fund board amounted to suits against the state itself, and sovereign immunity conditioned the right to sue the state on terms prescribed by the legislature. Here, the proper method for addressing plaintiffs' constitutional challenges was payment of the tax, then seeking a refund as provided by the legislature, not seeking a declaratory judgment of invalidity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff brought this action to recover a payment made under protest of sums assessed by the Commissioner of Revenue as income taxes due North Carolina for the years 1954, 1955, and 1956, with interest accrued thereon.  He alleges the assessments were void because in violation of rights guaranteed to him by sec. 2, Art. IV, and sec. 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.  The facts necessary to a determination of the controversy were stipulated.  We summarize the facts stipulated: Plaintiff was, during the years 1954, 1955, and 1956 engaged &quot;in owning, managing and operating several hotels and motels in the States of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.&quot; He was, during said period, a resident of Georgia.  He filed income tax returns for each of said years.  These returns disclosed his total gross income and gross income in North Carolina.  He deducted from his North Carolina income not only his expense incurred in the operation of his North Carolina business but that proportion of &quot;his total itemized personal deductions, including non-business interest paid and contributions&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which his North Carolina gross income bore to his total gross income.

The trial court determined that the taxpayer was not entitled to recover the assessment he paid under protest and the court affirmed. It noted that N.C. Gen.

The court then held that the statute did not create an arbitrary discrimination by allowing residents to deduct expenses unrelated to producing income, while denying that right to the taxpayer, and that there was no unconstitutional discrimination against nonresident taxpayers by confining the deduction of expenses and losses to those that were connected with income arising from sources within the North Carolina.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action, by virtue of G.S. 105-267, against the State Commissioner of Revenue to recover an additional income tax of $ 46,521.43, plus $ 3,721.71 interest, totaling $ 50,243.14, for the year 1953, paid under protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties, pursuant to G.S. 1-184-185, waived trial by jury, and agreed that the judge might find the facts, make conclusions of law, and render judgment thereon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts found by the judge, which are material and essential to a decision of this appeal, are summarized, except when quoted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virginia Electric and Power Company, hereafter called VEPCO, is a Virginia corporation engaged in the year 1953 in the business of generating electricity, and transmitting, distributing and selling the same in the States of Virginia, West Virginia, and the northeastern part of North Carolina.  It distributes gas only in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia.  (The undisputed evidence, though not incorporated in the findings of fact, shows that the North Carolina Tax Review Board by Administrative Order No. 27 held that the operation of the gas business by VEPCO in Virginia was not a part&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the company's unitary business in North Carolina, and directed that net income from such part of its business be excluded from income apportionable to North Carolina).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 9 April 1954, following an extension of time given by defendant to file its income tax return for 1953, VEPCO, pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 105-134, II, Foreign Corporations, 3, in force in 1953, filed a North Carolina income tax return based on the statutory allocation formula there set forth.  This return stated that VEPCO'S total gross income for 1953 was $ 79,911,518.00, its total allowable expenses for the year $ 62,206,103.00, its total net income, electric department, $ 17,705,415.00, the proportion taxable in North Carolina 7.302351%, $ 1,292,911.00, its total tax due at 6%, $ 77,574.66.  VEPCO paid no tax on this return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the same day VEPCO filed another North Carolina income tax return stating its total gross income for 1953 was $ 5,835,719.00, its total allowable expenses for the year $ 5,518,605.00, its total net income $ 317,114.00, proportion taxable in North Carolina 100%, its total tax due at 6% $ 19,026.84, interest due $ 52.13, total amount due $ 19,078.97.  VEPCO paid to the State on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this return $ 19,078.97.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(These returns were introduced in evidence by VEPCO.  The return upon which no tax was paid is plaintiff's Exhibit 1, and the return upon which $ 19,078.97 was paid is its Exhibit 2.  We have stated the contents of these returns somewhat more fully than set forth in the findings to avoid setting them forth later.  We believe what we have done is in the interest of clarity).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time VEPCO paid to the State of North Carolina income tax in the amount of $ 19,078.97, it &quot;filed a petition with the North Carolina Tax Review Board asking authority to pay its tax on a separate accounting basis or, in the alternative, on the basis of substitution of the payroll formula for the gross receipts formula or, as a third alternative, in the event neither of the first two alternatives was granted, to allow VEPCO to pay an income tax to the State of North Carolina for the year 1953 based on the substitution of the average of the gross receipts and payroll ratios for the statutory formula provided in G.S. 105-134-II(3).&quot;<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">This is the petition summarized in the findings of fact:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;1. The Company is a Virginia corporation duly qualified to do business in North Carolina. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  It conducts an electric utility business in Northeastern North Carolina.  Its principal North Carolina office is located at Williamston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;2. The Company is subject to the North Carolina income tax.  As a foreign corporation, it is required, in accordance with North Carolina General Statutes, &sect; 105-134-II, to 'pay annually an income tax equivalent to six per cent of a proportion of its entire net income' determined in accordance with the gross receipts formula contained in paragraph (3) of that subsection.  If the Company's entire net income from electric operations for 1953 were apportioned in accordance with this formula, net income of $ 1,292,911 would be allocated to North Carolina and the tax would be $ 77,574.66.  The details of this computation are shown on Exhibit 1. The Company believes that such apportionment operates to subject it to taxation on a greater portion of its net income than is reasonably attributable to business or earnings within North Carolina for the reasons herein stated.  The Company's service area in North Carolina covers the extreme northeastern section of the state which is predominantly agricultural and, as a consequence, thinly populated.  The largest&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  incorporated community served in North Carolina is Roanoke Rapids with a population of 8,156 (1950 census).  By contrast the Company serves most of the major population centers in Virginia, including the Richmond, Petersburg, Hopewell area; the Norfolk, Portsmouth, Newport News area; and the Arlington, Alexandria, Fairfax area.  The Company during 1953 had uniform rates throughout the territory served, with minor exceptions not here material.  As a consequence it is obvious that the Company's operations are relatively more profitable in Virginia than in North Carolina.  To further illustrate this point there were 24 customers per mile of distribution line in Virginia and West Virginia at December 31, 1953 as compared with 10 in North Carolina.  The investment in distribution facilities in North Carolina per customer amounted to $ 401 at December 31, 1953 as compared with an investment of only $ 266 in Virginia and West Virginia.  Any additional evidence furnished comparing the operations of the Company in Virginia and West Virginia with North Carolina could only add weight to the Company's contention that the apportionment of net income to North Carolina on the basis of the gross receipts&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  formula prescribed in &sect; 105-134-II(3) of the North Carolina General Statutes must operate to subject it to taxation on a greater portion of its net income than is reasonably attributable to business or earnings within North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;3. The Company maintains in its books of account a detailed allocation of receipts and expenditures attributable to its North Carolina operations.  These detailed allocations, in the opinion of the Company, reflect more clearly than the applicable allocation formula or alternative formulas prescribed by the statute the income attributable to the business of the Company in North Carolina.  A statement of this computation is shown on Exhibit 2. Net income in 1953 from North Carolina operations so determined would be $ 317,114, and the tax would be $ 19,026.84 The Company is of the view that the separate accounting method is proper and best reflects its income and earnings attributable to North Carolina and that the Board should permit the Company to follow the separate accounting method as authorized by &sect; 105-134-II-(4) of the North Carolina Statutes in filing its return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;4. The Company has ascertained the ratio of all salaries, wages, commissions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  and other compensation paid or incurred by it in North Carolina for services during 1953 to total salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation paid by it in connection with its electric business.  If the factor so determined were substituted for the gross receipts factor and applied to the Company's 1953 net income from its electric operations, as authorized by &sect; 105-134-II-(4) of the North Carolina Statutes net income of $ 892,031 would be allocated to North Carolina and the resulting tax would be $ 53,521.86.  The details of this computation are shown on Exhibit 3, Section I.  The Company submits that allocation on this basis, while not as just, fair or proper as the separate accounting basis, is obviously more equitable in view of the facts of this case than allocation by the gross receipts factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;5. If the wage factor were averaged with the gross receipts factor rather than substituted for such factor, as set forth in paragraph 4 above, and applied to the Company's 1953 net income from its electric operations, as authorized by &sect; 105-134-II-(4) of the North Carolina Statutes net income of $ 1,092,471 would be allocated to North Carolina and the resulting tax would be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  $ 65,548.27, as shown on Exhibit 3, Section II.  While the allocation on this basis is not as just, fair or proper as the separate accounting method or as equitable as the use of the wage factor alone it is, nonetheless more equitable than allocation by use of the gross receipts factor alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;THE COMPANY, accordingly, petitions the Board for relief as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(1) That the Board authorize the Company to file its return and pay its income tax for 1953 in accordance with the separate accounting method shown on Exhibit 2 as permitted by General Statutes, &sect; 105-134-II-(4) (b); or</SPAN></P>

<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We insert the petition here rather than later on in the interest of clarity.  It is dated 9 April 1954.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the year 1953, the total gross receipts of VEPCO from its Electric Operations everywhere was $ 79,904,007, and its total gross receipts in North Carolina were $ 5,834,871, or 7.302351% of its gross receipts from all of its Electric Operations; the total payroll of VEPCO for its Electric Operations everywhere was $ 19,246,057, and its total payroll in North Carolina for that year was $ 969,651, or 5.038180% of its total payroll for Electric Operations everywhere; that the average of VEPCO'S gross receipts and payroll ratios for the State of North Carolina for the year 1953 was 6.170266%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Tax Review Board of North Carolina is an administrative agency duly created and established by the General Assembly of North Carolina and was, at all times relevant to this action, vested with the authority and power under G.S. 105-134-II(4) of varying within limitations the statutory income apportionment formula applicable to any particular multi-state corporation upon a showing by 'clear, cogent and convincing proof' that the applicable statutory allocation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or apportionment formula would subject the taxpayer '. . . to taxation on a greater portion of its net income than is reasonably attributable to business earnings within this State . . .' and upon a further showing by the petitioning taxpayer that it is, by the same standard of proof, entitled to the relief prayed for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Tax Review Board, after hearing on June 28, 1955, issued its Administrative Order No. 27 permitting VEPCO to substitute for the statutory gross receipts formula applicable to it the average of the gross receipts and payroll ratios, thus granting VEPCO'S third alternative prayer for relief in its petition filed with the Tax Review Board.  This resulted in allocated North Carolina net income for the tax year 1953 of $ 1,092,471 and in total income tax due North Carolina of $ 65,548.27.  The plaintiff duly filed exceptions to the decision of the Tax Review Board, which exceptions were overruled by the Board.  The decision of the Tax Review Board was not appealed to the Superior Court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the decision of the North Carolina Tax Review Board, which is referred to in the finding of fact, and which we insert here rather than later in the interest of clarity: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;At a meeting of the TAX REVIEW BOARD held in the City of Raleigh on July 29, 1955, the full membership of the Board formally considered the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Exceptions to Findings</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which were filed with the Board on July 27, 1955, on behalf of the Virginia Electric and Power Company pursuant to G.S. 105-163, such exceptions having been made to the findings and determinations of the Tax Review Board, insofar as they relate to the income years 1953, 1954 and subsequent years, contained in Administrative Order No. 27 entered June 28, 1955.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In giving full consideration to the matter, the Board at the aforesaid meeting found and determined:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. That Virginia Electric and Power Company (hereinafter referred to as the Company) filed separate petitions before the Tax Review Board on November 30, 1953, April 12, 1954, and March 16, 1955 concerning the allocation of its net income for the income years 1952, 1953 and 1954 respectively.  That after hearings had been duly held on said petitions, the Board, at a meeting on June 28, 1955 gave full consideration to evidence, contentions and arguments as set forth in the above-mentioned petitions and hearings, and entered its Administrative Order No. 27 covering&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  taxable years 1952, 1953, 1954 and subsequent years, granting the taxpayer-company one of its alternative prayers for relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. That in each of the said petitions, the Company requested that it be authorized to report income to this State on the basis of separate accounting as permitted by G.S. 105-134, II, 4(b), or, in the event such relief could not be granted, that it be authorized to allocate income to this State either by substituting the wage factor for the gross receipts factor, or by adding the wage factor to the gross receipts factor, as permitted by G.S. 105-134, II, 4(a).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. That on the basis of all the evidence, contentions and arguments set forth in the petitions, records, and hearings, the Board concluded that the applicable statutory provision, G.S. 105-134, II, 3, which required the Company to apportion its income according to the gross receipts formula described therein, had operated and would so operate as to subject the Company to taxation in this State on a greater portion of its net income than could reasonably be attributed to business or earnings within this State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. That accordingly, the Board, in its Administrative Order No. 27, granted to the Company&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the alternative relief requested in each of its petitions, by authorizing the Company to allocate its income for income tax purposes on the basis of a ratio obtained by adding a salaries and wages factor to the gross receipts factor as permitted by G.S. 105-134, II, 4(a).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. And, that although such relief was in accordance with one of the alternative prayers for relief asked by the Company in each of its above-mentioned petitions, on July 27, 1955, the Company filed formal exceptions to the findings and determinations of the Board, as they relate to income years 1953, 1954 and subsequent years, contained in Administrative Order No. 27, on the grounds:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'(1) The allocation of net income to North Carolina on the basis of the arithmetical average of the gross receipts ratio and the salaries and wages ratio subjects the Company to income taxation by North Carolina on a greater portion of its net income than is reasonably attributable to business or earnings within the State of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'(2) The Company employs on its books of account a detailed allocation of receipts and expenditures which reflects more clearly than any allocation formula prescribed by G.S. Sec. 105-134 the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  income attributable to its business within the State of North Carolina.  Such separate accounting best reflects the income and earnings of the Company attributable to North Carolina.  The Board was in error in refusing to permit the determination of income subject to the North Carolina income tax on the basis of such separate accounting method rather than on the basis of an allocation formula.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The TAX REVIEW BOARD, having formally passed upon the above-quoted exceptions pursuant to G.S. 105-163, hereby makes the following rulings:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. That the Board was correct in its finding as stated in Administrative Order No. 27 that the application of the formula required by G.S. 105-134, II subsection 3 has operated and will so operate as to subject the Company to taxation on a greater portion of its net income than is reasonably attributable to business or earnings within this State, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. That the Board was correct in finding that the allocation of the Company's net income to North Carolina on the basis of the arithmetical average of the gross receipts ratio and the salaries and wages ratio<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(a) more accurately reflects the Company's net income attributable to this State than does&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  the applicable statutory formula (i. e. the formula required by G.S. 105-134, II subsection 3), and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(b) more accurately reflects the Company's net income attributable to this State than would the substitution of the salaries and wages factor for the gross receipts factor, as authorized by G.S. 105-134, II subsection 4(a), and</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. That therefore, the Board was acting within its authority as set out in G.S. 105-134, II subsection 4 in granting its Administrative Order No. 27 the aforementioned relief, for which the petitioner asked in its alternative prayer for relief, and to which the Board found the petitioner entitled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereupon, defendant assessed VEPCO with additional State income tax for 1953 in the amount of $ 46,521.43 ($ 65,548.27 less $ 19,026.84 makes $ 46,521.43), plus $ 3,721.71 for interest, for a total of $ 50,243.14.  Plaintiff paid this additional State income tax, and has followed the statutory procedure to sue for its recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The separate accounting system devised by VEPCO was developed primarily for rate making purposes with some adjustments for income tax purposes.  It has been accepted for rate making purposes by the three States in which it operates. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This separate accounting system is based upon numerous and varying allocation formulas, some of which are based upon a combination of allocations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The electrical operation of VEPCO is an integrated system with unity of ownership, management, and production and distribution of electrical power.  It is not known by VEPCO whether a unit of electric energy generated in North Carolina or in Virginia will be sold in Virginia, West Virginia or North Carolina; nor in which States expense items such as leakage occur, nor to which State such a leakage item should be charged.  The electric business done by VEPCO in North Carolina contributes to the success of the over-all electric operations of VEPCO in the three States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VEPCO has failed to show by clear, cogent and convincing proof that the allocation formula (allocation based on the average of the wages and gross receipts factors as permitted by G.S. 105-134-II, 4) which the State Tax Review Board permitted it to use, as requested by it in one of its alternative prayers for relief in its petition for review of apportionment of net income, year 1953, filed with the State Tax Review Board, (and above set forth), subjects VEPCO to taxation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by North Carolina on a greater proportion of its net income than is reasonably attributable to its earnings or business in North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VEPCO has failed to show that the State Tax Review Board abused its statutory discretion, or acted arbitrarily, or unlawfully in permitting it to use the allocation formula it requested in one of its alternative prayers for relief as above set forth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VEPCO has failed to show by clear, cogent and convincing proof that its separate accounting system reflects more clearly the income attributable to its business in North Carolina than does the allocation formula, which the State Board of Tax Review permitted it to use at its request, as above set forth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based upon its findings of fact the judge made the following conclusions of law:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. That VEPCO was not entitled to base its income tax return and payment of its income tax for the year 1953 on its separate accounting method.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. That the Tax Review Board did not abuse the discretion vested in it by the General Assembly and did not act arbitrarily, unreasonably or unlawfully in permitting VEPCO to use an alternative allocation formula based upon the arithmetical average of its gross receipts and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  salaries and wages ratios in determining the portion of its income reasonably attributable to its business or earnings within North Carolina for income tax purposes for the year 1953.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. That the Commissioner of Revenue, in assessing the additional income tax which VEPCO seeks to recover by this action, had no alternative other than to follow the order of the Tax Review Board permitting VEPCO to use the alternative formula in computing the portion of its net income reasonably attributable to its North Carolina business for the 1953 income tax year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. That the action of the Tax Review Board and the defendant's assessment were in compliance with G.S. 105-134, and such action and the section on which it was based, do not constitute, as applied to the plaintiff, an undue burden on interstate commerce in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment or the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. That the plaintiff, VEPCO, is not entitled to recover anything by this action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereupon, the judge adjudged and decreed that VEPCO recover nothing, and dismissed the action, taxing VEPCO with the costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the judgment VEPCO appealed.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>

The taxpayer filed a petition for review of its income tax liability. The North Carolina Tax Review Board (board) determined that the statutory formula based on gross receipts alone would have subjected the taxpayer to taxation of a greater portion of its net income than was attributable to its earnings within the state. Therefore, the board permitted the taxpayer to calculate its net income based upon the arithmetical average of the gross receipts ratio and the salaries and wages ratio. The board imposed an additional income tax against the taxpayer based upon the alternative formula. The taxpayer paid the additional income tax under protest. The taxpayer filed an action against the commissioner to recover the amount of the additional income tax. The trial court dismissed the taxpayer's action. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order. The court held that the taxpayer was not entitled to pay its taxes based on a separate accounting basis because it had not established that the result of the alternative formula was excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The husband served on a military reservation in North Carolina for more than six months prior to the time that he filed an action for a divorce.

The trial court overruled the wife's motion, and she filed an appeal. The court held that in order for a court to exercise jurisdiction affecting the marital status of the parties, at least one of them had to be domiciled in the state for at least six months prior to the filing of the divorce action. The court further noted that mere presence was insufficient for establishing domicile. The court found that the husband's testimony regarding his domicile in North Carolina only showed that he had an intent to make North Carolina his home prior to moving to Leavenworth. The court found error in the jury instruction because it omitted the requirement of an intent to adopt North Carolina as the husband's legal residence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendants went into a store as a group to be served and were arrested. The state had no statute that required the exclusion of Afro-Americans and no law that forbid discrimination by a restaurant owner on account of race. The court affirmed defendants' convictions. The operator of a privately owned restaurant privately operated in a private owned building had the right to select his clientele and to make the selection based on the race of the potential customers. The restaurant owner had no common-law duty to serve every one who came in. The court found that the judicial process did not constitute state action and was not a violation of defendants' rights under the Fourteenth Amendment or the state constitution. The law was to punish trespassers for unlawful entry, even though it enforced the clear legal right of racial discrimination of the owner. Further, the statutes were not too vague to be enforceable. Defendants knew when they were asked to leave that the person was the agent of the storeowner. Sufficient evidence was presented to take the case to the jury and a general charge of error without a definite assignment of error was too general to present a question for decision.</SPAN></P>

The court held that ordinary restrictions with respect to the delegation of power to an agency of the state, which exercised no function of government, did not apply to cities, towns, or counties. The legislature had the right, unhampered by constitutional restrictions, to grant the power given in the to municipalities having a population of 5,000 or more since the power granted was incidental to municipal government in matters of purely local concern. The court held that by enactment of 1959 N.C. Sess. Laws 1009, the legislature did not delegate to the municipalities of the state having a population of 5,000 or more, an discretion with respect to the provisions of the law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the trial court, which convicted defendant of soliciting students for an out of state private school without first securing a license from the state board of education (board) and without executing a bond in the county of solicitation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">After defendant, a solicitor for an out-of-state private school, solicited an in-state student, defendant was convicted of a misdemeanor for having failed to meet the statutory requirements of securing a license from the board and executing a bond in the county of solicitation. Claiming the statutory provision was unconstitutional, defendant sought review, and the court reversed. Following an examination of the limitations on the legislative regulation of private schools and ordinary occupations, the court held the state lacked a right, under the police powers, to regulate private schools and private school solicitors. After noting there was no manifest present need for the regulation which affected the health, morals, or safety of the public, the court rested its decision on the fact that all matters had been left to the board's unlimited discretion. In basing its decision on this unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority, the court noted that the legislature had set no standards for evaluating a private school's contract, advertising material, or instructional program and had failed to establish a test or rule of any kind for determining the fitness of a solicitor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">At issue before the trial court was whether the temporary restraining order should be continued to the hearing. The trial court determined that the statute under which the action was filed was unconstitutional and thus dissolved the restraining order. The court reversed on appeal. The court held that the question was not whether the statute was constitutional or unconstitutional, but whether the showing made raised serious questions, under federal constitution and state law, and disclosed that enforcement of the statute, pending final hearing, would inflict irreparable damages. The court held that the trial court on the motion to show cause why the injunction should not be continued to the hearing had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the controversy on the merits. The only question was whether the order should be made, dissolved, or continued. The court held that the trial court could not go further and determine the final rights of the parties, which had to be reserved for the final trial of the action. Accordingly, the court set aside the trial court's order and remanded for a hearing on the specific issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special proceeding instituted by petitioners, Redevelopment Commission of Greensboro and the city of Greensboro, before the clerk of the Superior Court of Guilford County for the condemnation under the power of eminent domain provided for in G.S. 40-11&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Condemnation Proceedings, and in G.S. Chapter 160, Article 37, known as the Urban Redevelopment Law, of certain land, which is a part of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">corpus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of the testamentary trusts created by the last will and testament of Jack Milton, deceased, -- the last will and testament of Jack Milton, deceased, appointed respondent executor of his will and testamentary trustee of his estate --, heard before Judge Preyer on appeal by respondent from orders of the clerk of the Superior Court of Guilford County appointing commissioners of appraisal, and affirming their report assessing damages for the taking of the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioners and respondent, pursuant to G.S. 1-184 -- 1-185, waived trial by jury, and agreed that Judge Preyer might answer the issue as to damages for the taking of the land in the sum of $ 15,600.00, might&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  find the facts, make conclusions of law, and render judgment thereon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Preyer's judgment is as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;1. That the city of Greensboro is a Municipal Corporation having and exercising the rights, power and authority conferred by Chapter 37 of the Private Laws of 1923, as Amended, and by applicable General Statutes of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;2. That after due notice, by proper ordinance designated, 'Chapter 75, Redevelopment Commission of Greensboro,' passed by the City Council of the city of Greensboro on the 15th day of October 1951, as shown by petitioners' Exhibit A, the City Council of the city of Greensboro found as a fact that blighted and slum areas existed within the city, and thereafter certified said ordinance to the Secretary of State of North Carolina.  That thereafter the Redevelopment Commission of Greensboro was created under G.S. 160-454, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c43">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">, and a certificate of incorporation was issued to the Redevelopment Commission of Greensboro by the Secretary of State on the 23rd day of October 1951, as shown by petitioners' Exhibit B; and that thereafter the Redevelopment Commission of Greensboro was duly organized by the adoption of by-laws&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  and the election of officers, in accordance with Statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;3. That thereafter, pursuant to statute, the Greensboro Planning Board, by resolution duly adopted, found that there were blighted and slum areas within the city of Greensboro and designated a section of Greensboro, described in Exhibit E of the Petition, as a blighted and slum area and a redevelopment area; that petitioners' Exhibit D is a map of said area; that the findings of the Greensboro Planning Board were duly approved by the City Council of the city of Greensboro, as shown by petitioners' Exhibit E.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;4. That thereafter, pursuant to the provisions and requirements of the statutes, the Redevelopment Commission determined that the section known as Area No. 1, a part of said area being known as the Cumberland Project, was most in need of redevelopment, and made certain studies and found certain facts in the manner prescribed by statute, and prepared a plan of redevelopment for the Cumberland Project.  That said study and plan produced, among other things, maps showing the present existing use of the area, maps showing the proposed use of the area upon redevelopment, standards of population density, land coverage and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  building densities, a preliminary site plan of the area, proposed changes in zoning ordinances and maps, maps showing changes in street lay-outs and levels, a statement of the estimated cost and method of financing of the acquisition of the redevelopment area, a statement of such continuing controls as are deemed necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statutes authorizing redevelopment and slum clearance, a statement of the feasible method proposed for the relocation of families displaced in said area, all as shown by petitioners' Exhibits F through M, inclusive.  That thereafter said plan was submitted to the Greensboro Planning Board, which Board reaffirmed the fact that said area was a blighted and slum area and approved the plan of redevelopment for the Cumberland Project, as shown by petitioners' Exhibits O and P; and that subsequently thereto the City Council passed a resolution calling for a public hearing on said matter, which was duly held; and by proper resolution subsequently thereto the City Council approved the redevelopment and slum clearance plan as submitted, as shown by petitioners' Exhibits Q and R.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;5. That the respondent is the owner of the land described in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  the petition and the subject of this eminent domain proceeding; that the property of the respondent, as set forth in the petition, is within the area of the Cumberland Project, and is an integral part of the plan of redevelopment.  That the acquisition of said land is necessary to accomplish the plan of redevelopment, and that, if acquired, the city of Greensboro and the Redevelopment Commission of Greensboro will, in good faith, carry out the plan of redevelopment above specified.  That the petitioners have attempted to acquire title to said land by purchase, but were unable to do so, due to the fact that the respondent contended the land had more value than had been given it in the appraisal by the petitioners; and that certain constitutional questions had arisen on the basis of which the respondent denies the right of the Redevelopment Commission of Greensboro to acquire and hold title to real estate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;6. That the area described in the petition, known as the Cumberland Project, in which the land of the respondent is located, is hereby found to be a blighted and slum area as defined by G.S. 160-456(q).  That said area is found by the Court to be largely residential, in which the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  structures are depreciated, dilapidated, deteriorated and substandard in all respects, without necessary provisions for ventilation, light, sanitation and inside plumbing; that throughout the area there exists an unusually high density of population with the entailed overcrowding, unsanitary and unsafe conditions, which constitute an abnormal hazard to the health, safety and welfare of the community; that the existence of such ills is conducive to ill health, transmission of disease, infant mortality, juvenile delinquency, crime, and fire hazards, and is detrimental to the public health, safety, morals and welfare of the citizens of the city of Greensboro; that more than 68% of the houses and structures in said area are substandard insofar as their condition relates to the factors above enumerated; and that up to 89% of all structural units in the area have one or more of the elements of deterioration and dilapidation set forth above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;7. That under the plan of redevelopment the city of Greensboro has appropriated and paid to the Redevelopment Commission of Greensboro sums of money, and the city plans and anticipates the appropriation and payment to the redevelopment Commission of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  Greensboro further outlays of cash, improvements, etc.; that the money heretofore appropriated and paid to the Redevelopment Commission of Greensboro has come from sources of income to the city of Greensboro other than from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c43">ad valorem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> tax revenue.  That the city of Greensboro will make additional appropriations in the future and pay additional sums to the Redevelopment Commission of Greensboro for the furtherance of the redevelopment plan, and that the funds for said future appropriations will be derived from funds received by the city other than from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c43">ad valorem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> tax revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;8. That the city of Greensboro, in compliance with the Order of Confirmation of the Report of the Commissioners of Appraisal, signed February 10, 1960, by the clerk of the Superior Court of Guilford County, has paid into Court the sum of $ 15,500.00., this being the figure arrived at by the Commissioners of Appraisal as damage to the respondent for the taking of its property; and that this sum was appropriated and paid by the city of Greensboro from income received by the city from sources other than </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c43">ad valorem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> tax revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;9. That petitioners' Exhibits T(1) through T(13), being photographs of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  Cumberland Project described in the petition and offered in evidence, are fair portrayals of the actual conditions as now exist within the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;10. That all meetings, hearings, and notices given and held by the City Council, the Greensboro Planning Board, and the Redevelopment Commission of Greensboro, in compliance with the statutory procedural requirements for the creation of the Redevelopment Commission of Greensboro, and the accomplishment of the redevelopment plan, were properly given and held; and that all statutory requirements have been met and complied with as to giving of notices, holding of public meetings, and passing of ordinances and resolutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;11. That the conditions existing in the Cumberland Project area cannot practicably be eliminated by the exercise of the police power of the city of Greensboro, nor alleviated by the anticipated efforts or intervention of private enterprise.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c31"><SPAN CLASS="c10">And upon the foregoing Findings of Fact the Court makes the following --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c32"><SPAN CLASS="c10">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;1. That this condemnation proceeding is properly brought under G.S. 40-11, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c43">et seq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;2. That the taking of respondent's property in this proceeding by eminent domain is a taking for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  a public purpose and use, and that such taking is not in violation of Article I, Section 1, or Article I, Section 17, of the Constitution of the State of North Carolina, but is a taking 'by the law of the land.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;3. That the Urban Redevelopment Law, Chapter 160, Subchapter 7, Article 37, of the General Statutes of North Carolina, is not an unlawful delegation of legislative power and authority to the Redevelopment Commission of Greensboro, and does not violate Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution of North Carolina, for that said Act specifically, and in detail, sets forth standards and guidances for the creation of redevelopment agenies and the pursuit of their activities thereunder, leaving only to the municipality and the local redevelopment agency the determination of facts which bring the law into operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;4. That Chapter 160, Subchapter 7, Article 37, of the General Statutes of North Carolina does not confer upon nor authorize the Redevelopment Commission of Greensboro or the city of Greensboro the power to grant, nor does the plan of redevelopment as set forth in the petition in pursuance of said statute grant, exclusive and separate emoluments and privileges to persons&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  or sets of persons in violation of Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;5. In the light of the evidence to the effect that only funds derived from sources other than </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c43">ad valorem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> tax revenue by the city of Greensboro have been used, appropriated, or spent by the city of Greensboro and the Redevelopment Commission of Greensboro, and that sums in the future will be appropriated by the city of Greensboro to the Redevelopment Commission from sources other than </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c43">ad valorem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> tax revenue, the provisions of Article V, Section 3, of the Constitution of North Carolina are not applicable in the determination of this cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;6. That as a matter of law the redevelopment area described in the petition as the Cumberland Project is a blighted and slum area within the meaning of G.S. 160-454, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c43">et seq.;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> and that by reason of said blighted and slum condition in the area the redevelopment of such area, under the plan of redevelopment as set forth in the petition, is necessary in the interest of the public health, safety, morals and welfare of the residents of the city of Greensboro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c31"><SPAN CLASS="c10">UPON THE FOREGOING FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  AND DECREED:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;1. That petitioner Redevelopment Commission of Greensboro is entitled to take, and all of the right, title and interest of the respondent in and to, the real property described in paragraph 5 of the petition, is hereby conveyed to said commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;2. That Respondent have and recover of Petitioners, as damages for the taking of said property, the sum of $ 15,600.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;3. That, the sum of $ 15,600.00 having been paid into Court by the city of Greensboro for the use and benefit of the Respondent, the Redevelopment Commission of Greensboro is authorized and empowered to enter into possession of the real property described in paragraph 5 of the petition forthwith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;4. That counsel fees in the sum of $ 2,000.00 are hereby awarded to Stern &amp; Rendleman, attorneys for the respondent, pursuant to G.S. 160-456, Subsection (q), which fee is charged as a part of the costs in this proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;5. That this judgment be recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds of Guilford County as a muniment of title in Redevelopment Commission of Greensboro.  Let the costs be taxed against the petitioners.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Respondent, the executor and trustee of testator's will, sought review of a judgment of a trial court (North Carolina) that was entered in favor of petitioners, municipal redevelopment commission (commission) and municipality, on their action for the condemnation of certain property. The relevant property was the subject of testamentary trusts set up by the testator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The commission and the municipality commenced a proceeding for the condemnation under the power of eminent domain certain land that was the part of the corpus of the testamentary trusts created by the testator. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the petitioners and affirmed appraisals that assessed damages for the taking of the land. On appeal, the executor maintained that the taking of property by the power of eminent domain under N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 160, art. 37, the Urban Redevelopment Law (Law), was not for a public use permitted under the North Carolina Constitution, but was a taking of private property for a private use, because under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160-464(a), the commission was empowered to transfer the real property to any redeveloper for residential or commercial uses. The court determined that the primary purpose of the taking was the eradication of blighted areas. The sale or transfer to a redeveloper was merely incidental or collateral to the primary purpose of the Law. Further, the court found that the executor's other arguments concerning alleged constitutionality of the Law lacked merit. Thus, the trial court judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The judgment entered in favor of petitioners that condemned the subject land and set forth a damage assessment the taking of the land was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff, North Carolina Utilities Commission, from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bone, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in Nashville, N. C., September 19, 1959 (judgment signed October 9, 1959), of Edgecombe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This proceeding originated before the North Carolina Utilities Commission upon application of the Carolina Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company for a general increase in its local service telephone rates in North Carolina.  On 4 September, 1958 the North Carolina Utilities Commission entered an order approving in part and denying in part the application for increases in telephone rates and by the same order prohibited the further practice of rendering telephone service to municipalities at other than tariff rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter the city of Wilson on 6 October 1958, filed a petition for rehearing of so much of the order of 4 September 1958 as affects franchise service and gave notice of appeal from said order insofar as it relates to franchise service.  And on 15 October 1958 the Utilities Commission ordered the proceeding reopened only to the extent that franchise service in the way of free telephone service to the cities and towns is involved within the company's territory.  The matter was heard before the Commission on 13&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  November 1958, at which time both the City of Wilson and the City of Rocky Mount were present and offered evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 13 January 1958, the Commission entered an order reaffirming its conclusion in respect to franchise telephone service as set forth in its original order of 4 September 1958.  The Commission made </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. Carolina Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company * * * has granted concession telephone service, without charge, or at lower rates than the rates which it has on file with the North Carolina Utilities Commission for similar service, under similar conditions, to certain municipal corporations and other users of its service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. The granting of concession telephone service, without charge, or at rates less than those on file with the North Carolina Utilities Commission for similar service, under similar conditions, creates an unreasonable preference or advantage to the receiver of such service under such circumstances and subjects other persons and corporations which received service at regular scheduled tariff rates to unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage and establishes an unreasonable difference as to rates between localities receiving&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the same class of service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. Concession telephone service, without charge, or at rates lower than those which the utility has on file with the North Carolina Utilities Commission for similar service under similar conditions, has been granted by the utility company to the municipalities and required by the municipality of the utility company in consideration for franchise rights to the utility to operate in the municipality and use the streets, alleys and roads for its pole lines and underground conduits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the foregoing findings of fact the Commission reached the following conclusions set out in pertinent part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We find three compelling reasons to support our original order denying the company the right to continue furnishing concession telephone service to the municipalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the first place, every public utility shall file with the Commission, within such time and in such form as the Commission may designate, schedules showing all rates established by it and collected or enforced, or to be collected or enforced within the jurisdiction of the Commission.  This is a provision of G.S. 62-68.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Carolina Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company has on file with the North Carolina&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Utilities Commission schedules of rates and charges for all of its service.  These rates and charges were established and fixed by the Commission in its order of 4 September 1958, the very case in which this controversy arose.  Those schedules of rates and charges did not provide for a concession service, either without charge or at lower rates than the specified rate.  Thus, the granting of a concession rate, without charge, or at a rate lower than the regular scheduled rates for similar service under similar conditions, is in direct contravention of G.S. 62-69 and is not permissible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the second place, G. S. 62-70 provides that: 'No public utility shall, as to rates or services, make or grant any unreasonable preference or advantage to any corporation or person or subject any corporation or person to any unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage.  No public utility shall establish or maintain any unreasonable difference as to rates or services either as between localities or as between classes of service.  The Commission may determine any questions of fact arising under this section.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the testimony offered at the hearing is to the effect that telephone service is rendered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to some municipalities, without charge, or at lower rates than that particular service is rendered under similar conditions to other like municipalities and that some municipalities using the same phone service and under the same operating conditions receive service, without charge, while other municipalities so situate are paying for this service * * * At the same time no effort has been made to arrive at any standard by which the concession service is allowed * * * In other words, the public utility company with rates on file with the North Carolina Utilities Commission has engaged in bargaining away part of its available revenues for service with some municipalities, driving the best bargain it could, while other municipalities receiving similar phone service under similar conditions have not received any concession service.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the third place, it is quite clear from the testimony that the municipalities have required a certain amount of concession service for the franchise right of the utility to carry on its business in the municipality * * * The general law is embodied in G.S. 105-120 * * * Counties, cities and towns shall not levy any franchise, license, or privilege tax&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the business taxed under this section.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While it is contended by the municipalities that they are not levying a franchise or privilege tax upon the telephone company but are in effect receiving certain telephone service, without charge, in payment of actual services rendered by the municipality to the company for which it is entitled to be paid, it is well to note the written language used in the franchise ordinance or agreement: 'In consideration of the rights and franchises herein granted, the said company shall furnish to the said city, free of cost, space for its fire alarm and police telegraph wires, upon all poles and in all underground conduits, erected, constructed and maintained by the said company under this ordinance; the said company shall further and also furnish to the said city -- telephone stations, free of cost.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We conclude that our order of 4 September, 1958, with respect to charity discounts and franchise services should be sustained and adhered to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In apt time the City of Wilson and the City of Rocky Mount gave notice of appeal to the Superior Court.  The cause was heard before Judge Bone on 19 September 1959, out of term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter on 5 October 1959&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  judgment was entered reversing the order of the Utilities Commission, Judge Bone finding the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After hearing argument of counsel for each of the parties hereto and after consideration of the record before the Utilities Commission, the court is of the opinion that Chapter 685 of the 1959 Session Laws is not unconstitutional;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the court is of the further opinion that in reviewing the order of the Utilities Commission it must consider the law in effect at the time of the review rather than the law that was in effect at the time of the Commission's decision;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, in that light, the court is of the opinion that each and every exception of the City of Wilson and the City of Rocky Mount should be sustained and that the order of the North Carolina Utilities Commission of January 13, 1959, should be reversed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is, therefore, considered, ordered and adjudged that the exceptions of the City of Wilson and the City of Rocky Mount to the order of the North Carolina Utilities Commission, dated January 13, 1959, in this cause, be and the same are hereby sustained, and that the order of the Commission be reversed, and the cause remanded to said Commission for further proceedings&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not inconsistent with this judgment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the foregoing judgment the North Carolina Utilities Commission excepts and appeals to the Supreme Court, and assigns error.  </SPAN></P>

The court ruled that &sect; 93A-1 did not violate defendant's substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution or under N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The court ruled that it was within the state's police power to regulate real estate brokers because the real estate business affected a substantial public interest. Section 93A-1 was reasonable and nondiscriminatory because its requirements were applied to all applicants alike, and it placed no arbitrary or unreasonable burden on the pursuit of the occupation. The court also ruled that the fee charged to license applicants was not a tax. Thus, &sect; 93A-1 was constitutional. The court also ruled that defendant's consent to a suspended sentence was still effective because his notice of appeal did not invalidate it pursuant to N.C. Gen.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petition under G.S. 20-233 to review respondent's act in refusing to issue to petitioner an operator's or driver's permit to operate a motor vehicle upon the public highways.  The petitioner alleges in substance the following: That he is a resident of North Carolina and for many years was a licensed truck driver with years of experience and a perfect accident record.  In 1948 his son, while driving petitioner's automobile, was involved in an accident as a result of which a judgment for $ 3,000 was rendered against the petitioner at the October Term, 1952, Forsyth Superior Court.  On October 24, 1952, the judgment creditor caused a copy of the judgment to be certified to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, and a second copy was certified on April 22, 1953.  On July 6, 1953, the Department of Motor Vehicles ordered petitioner's operator's license suspended and a member of the State Highway Patrol picked up the operator's license and the registration plates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioner, being unable to satisfy the judgment and his other obligations, on December 16, 1954, was adjudged a bankrupt.  On&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  February 28, 1955, the United States Court for the Middle District of North Carolina entered an order in the bankruptcy proceeding discharging him from all claims and debts provable against him under the acts of Congress; that the order discharged his liability on the judgment; that G.S. 20-244 to the contrary is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioner further alleges the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles is without power to revoke or suspend his operator's license for more than one year from the date of the accident in which his son was involved; that the petitioner is thoroughly qualified for operator's license; that he has made application to the proper authorities and has furnished liability insurance showing financial responsibility; that the Department of Motor Vehicles and the respondent have refused to permit him to take examination for operator's license and have ordered his liability insurance cancelled; that the Department claims authority to refuse to issue license so long as the judgment against him remains unpaid; that the Acts of the North Carolina General Assembly do not, when properly construed, authorize the denial of a permit; but if they be so interpreted, they are unconstitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and invalid in that they contravene the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The respondent filed a demurrer on the grounds the complaint showed upon its face that the petitioner is not qualified for operator's license by reason of the unpaid judgment.  The court sustained the demurrer and the petitioner excepted and appealed.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained the commissioner's demurrer. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the period of suspension could not last for more than one year. The court found that the driver's petition stated a cause of action because it alleged that he was qualified for renewal of his license, was able to show financial responsibility, and that the commissioner had refused to allow him to show his qualifications because of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs by this appeal challenge the corporate existence of the municipality and the right of the individual defendants to serve as mayor and commissioners of the Town of Havelock conditionally created by c. 952, S.L. 1959.  As the basis for the asserted invalidity they allege (1) the Act is wholly void because of the qualifications prescribed for nominees for office, and (2) the election required by the Act as a condition to corporate existence was not called and held as required by the Act, thereby depriving numerous citizens of their suffrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Bundy issued a temporary order restraining defendants from exercising any of the powers of a municipality.  On plaintiffs' motion to continue this order in force, he heard the evidence, both parol and affidavits, offered by the parties.  Based on this evidence he found as a fact that the election required by the Act had not been properly held, because (1) the notice of the election failed to give any information with respect to the election officials and failed to designate any polling place in the described area, and (2) the place actually provided&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for electors to cast their ballots was outside of the area to be incorporated.  Based on his findings he concluded the election was void for want of authority to call it and for defects in the call and the manner of conducting the election.  He continued the restraining order to the final hearing.  Defendants excepted to the findings and order and appealed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiffs, citizens, taxpayers, qualified electors, and property owners brought an action challenging the corporate existence of defendant municipality and the right of defendant individuals to serve as mayor and commissioners of the municipality. The Craven County Court (North Carolina) restrained defendants from exercising any of the powers of a municipality on the basis that their election had not been properly held. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendants contended that plaintiffs' challenge to the municipality's corporate existence should have been brought by quo warranto. The court disagreed, holding that the action did not involve any of those wrongs specified to be challenged by quo warranto in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1-515, 55-122. It was not an action to determine a right to a public office or an action to prevent the exercise of a franchise by a de facto corporation. Rather, the action was to determine whether a de jure municipal corporation had been created. Because delay in challenging compliance with the statutory requirements might have permitted a de facto corporation to arise, thereby subjecting plaintiffs and their property to obligations and liabilities of municipal government, plaintiffs had a right to have the validity of the election determined without seeking authority from the attorney general. Nonetheless, the court reversed the trial court's injunction, which prevented defendants from exercising any of the powers of a municipality. In so ruling, the court stated that plaintiffs failed to allege any harm or threatened harm.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action to recover damages to plaintiff's described real property, located in the Town of Mount Holly, Gaston County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff alleged, stated separately, two causes of action, each based on essentially the same factual allegations but different as to the theory on which he sought to recover damages of $ 2,000.00 and costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff's factual allegations, summarized, are these: In November, 1957, defendant, without notice to or permission of plaintiff, caused its employees and agents to go upon plaintiff's property with a bulldozer and other earth-moving equipment.  Defendant's employees and agents &quot;bulldozed or scraped away substantially all living trees, plants and plant matter theretofore growing&quot; on plaintiff's property, &quot;including over 100 water oak or pin oak trees,&quot; and a portion of the topsoil, and deposited same in an unsightly pile about 165 feet long, 15-21 feet wide, averaging about 6 feet in height.  Prior to defendant's said conduct, the fair market value of plaintiff's property was $ 2,400.00; but, by reason thereof, its fair market value was reduced to $ 400.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On these&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  facts, plaintiff alleged, in his first cause of action, that defendant's said conduct constituted an unlawful, intentional and tortious trespass on his property, depriving plaintiff of his property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and of Article I, Section 17, of the North Carolina Constitution; and, in his second cause of action, plaintiff alleged, in addition, that defendant's said conduct caused and created both a public and private nuisance in that defendant (1) did not remove &quot;said unsightly pile&quot; from his property, (2) that the cost of removal &quot;would be tremendous and excessive,&quot; and (3) that &quot;the unsightly pile&quot; could not be burned because it contained &quot;the large amount of the plaintiff's earth and soil . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, a municipal corporation, answering, admitted plaintiff's ownership of the described property and that, in November, 1957, &quot;it authorized a clean-up of all vacant lots in a radius of three blocks of the center of Town that had grown up and become unsightly . . .&quot; Except as stated, defendant denied the essential allegations of the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a further answer and defense, defendant alleged&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that it authorized said clean-up &quot;pursuant to ordinances duly enacted and particularly that certain ordinance designated as Section No. 3 of Article III of the Code of the Town of Mount Holly,&quot; to wit:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;WEEDS: TIME FOR CUTTING.  The owner, or any person in possession of any vacant lot shall cut or shrub down within four inches of the ground all weeds, grass or other noxious growth from said lot at least twice each year; the first time not later than June 15 and the second time not later than August 15 of each and every year.  Each day after said dates, respectively, shall be and constitute a separate offense.  Said delinquent shall, upon conviction, pay a fine of one dollar for each day any said weeds or other noxious growth are not cut down upon said lot or lots on or before the fifteenth day of June and August, as aforesaid, the Board may cause the same to be cut down and the cost of cutting may be charged against each of said lots from which the said weeds or other noxious growth are removed and against the owners thereof, and charged to them and collected as other taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's further allegations, summarized, are these: Plaintiff had no valuable &quot;timbers&quot; growing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on his lot.  Plaintiff's lot is located about one and one-half blocks from the center of Mount Holly, on a main traveled street which is part of North Carolina Highway #27, and that &quot;plaintiff had allowed said lot to become overgrown with weeds, vines, brush, grass, kudzu, and other noxious growths to such an extent that it had become an eyesore and a menace to the general health of the people of the Town of Mount Holly.&quot; Plaintiff made no effort whatever to clean or clear his said lot.  After plaintiff's lot was cleaned and beautified, defendant &quot;always stood ready to remove said debris of vines, kudzu, brush, weeds, grass and other noxious growths,&quot; but plaintiff &quot;refused to allow the defendant or any of its employees to go upon the plaintiff's lot and remove said debris.&quot; The removal of the &quot;kudzu, weeds, brush, vines, grass and other noxious growths&quot; substantially improved plaintiff's property in appearance and substantially increased its value.  &quot;. . . any action taken by the defendant in cleaning plaintiff's lot was taken in good faith and with no intention other than to improve plaintiff's property in appearance and to add to the general good appearance of the Town of Mount&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Holly and to protect the health of its citizens and was a valid, constitutional exercise of the police powers and other constitutional authority vested in the Town of Mount Holly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;. . . the action of the employees of the defendant Town of Mount Holly, in removing said weeds, vines, brush, grass, kudzu and other noxious growths from the property of the plaintiff, was done as the valid exercise of a governmental function of the Town of Mount Holly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issues submitted, and the jury's answers, were as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. Did the defendant trespass upon the lands of the plaintiff, as alleged in the Complaint?  ANSWER: Yes.  2. What amount of damages, if any, is the plaintiff entitled to recover?  ANSWER: $ 400.00.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From judgment for plaintiff, in accordance with the verdict, defendant appealed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant town appealed the decision from the Gaston County trial court (North Carolina), which entered judgment for plaintiff landowner and denied an involuntary nonsuit in the suit by the landowner alleging an unconstitutional taking of private property, trespass, and the creations of both a public and private nuisance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Pursuant to a town ordinance, the town entered upon the landowner's property to remove an alleged nuisance because of the buildup of weeds, trees, and debris. The town argued that it acted in good faith to remove a nuisance in accordance with its police powers. The landowner argued that valuable trees were destroyed. The appellate court affirmed. The town had the authority to abate a public nuisance under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160-234 and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 160-200(6), (26), (28). However, a cause of action for damage was not defeated merely because the town was performing a governmental function. The appellate court reasoned that the test was whether the town's acts amounted to the taking of private property, regardless of whether it was acting pursuant to a lawful ordinance within its governmental powers. The only exception was if the action was necessary to remove or abate a nuisance. The destruction of the trees was not necessary and thus was the taking of private property, and the landowner was entitled to just compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The judgment in favor of the landowner in his suit alleging mainly an unconstitutional taking of private property and the denial of an involuntary nonsuit was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action instituted by the plaintiff, a Virginia corporation, to recover $ 19,681.66 from the defendant Pope Realty &amp; Insurance Company, a corporation (now in receivership), W. R. Winders, Receiver, and Charles A. Pope, Jr., a stockholder.  The plaintiff alleged it sold and delivered seven package houses on the following dates: May 14, August 7, October 20, and October 22, all in 1954; and on January 12, February 9, and June 20, all in 1955. There is no controversy about the liability of the corporation.  Its liability is conceded.  The controversy is whether Charles A. Pope, Jr., is individually liable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties waived jury trial and consented that the judge should hear the evidence, find the facts, state his conclusions of law, and render judgment.  The court found that Pope Realty &amp; Insurance Company was incorporated in June, 1954. Charles A. Pope, Jr., W. J. Darnell, and Marshall T. Spears, Jr., were the incorporators, each with one share of the capital stock.  Pope at all times was a director and president of the corporation.  Immediately upon organization, Spears sold and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  transferred his stock to Thomas E. Montjoy.  On November 5, 1954, the corporation purchased the share of Thomas E. Montjoy.  On October 4, 1955, Pope purchased the one outstanding share from W. J. Darnell.  From October 4, 1955, until the corporation went into receivership on March 19, 1956, Pope was the sole stockholder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff, through negotiation with Pope, sold and delivered three bills of merchandise subsequent to November 5, 1954, as follows: No. 55, January 12, 1955, $ 5,085.82; No. 57-A, February 9, 1955, $ 385.68; No. 67, June 20, 1955, $ 295.98. At the time these deliveries were made the corporation had two stockholders and directors -- the defendant Pope, and Darnell.  The plaintiff alleged the defendant Pope had received the benefits of all the deliveries from the beginning; that he was guilty of fraud in executing lien waivers by making false affidavits to the effect that all materials which went into the construction projects were paid for, when in fact the plaintiff had been paid nothing whatever.  Relying on the statements, loan companies advanced money to Pope on the lots and buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court found that Pope had executed the false affidavits but that they&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were not made to the plaintiff and it did not rely on them.  Therefore, insofar as the plaintiff was concerned, the defendant Pope had not perpetrated a fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversial issues raised by the pleadings need not be further detailed in view of the findings of fact made by the trial judge and his conclusions of law based thereon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the findings, the trial court held that (1) &quot;The plaintiff's claim is valid against the assets of Pope Realty &amp; Insurance Company in receivership.&quot; (2) &quot;The plaintiff have and recover nothing of the defendant Charles A. Pope, Jr.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff, upon the findings of fact, moved for judgment against Charles A. Pope, Jr., individually.  The motion was denied and the plaintiff excepted.  From the judgment that Charles A. Pope, Jr., is not individually liable, the plaintiff has appealed.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the buyer was not individually liable on the debt and the seller appealed. On appeal, the court remanded for modification of judgment. The court held that the buyer could not be held personally liable for the corporation's debt while the corporation had more than two stockholders. Thus, the buyer was not liable for the first four purchases. The court further held that the buyer was individually liable for the last three purchases that occurred while the corporation had only two stockholders.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action under G.S. 41-10 to remove clouds from plaintiffs' alleged title to real property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subject property consists of two separately described tracts of land in Turnbull Township, Bladen County, containing 65 acres, more or less, and 62 acres, more or less, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants denied plaintiffs' title.  They alleged defendants Arnold acquired title to and now own the subject property under a tax foreclosure proceeding conducted in accordance with Section 1720, Chapter 310, Public Laws of 1939, which, as amended, is now codified as G.S. 105-392, and under deeds referred to below.  In addition, they pleaded </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">in bar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of plaintiffs' action (1) the one-year limitation prescribed in G.S. 105-393, (2) the three-year limitation prescribed in G.S. 1-52, subsection 10, and (3) adverse possession under color of title for more than seven years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs alleged the tax foreclosure proceeding, in particulars set forth, did not comply with the requirements of G.S. 105-392. They alleged further that G.S. 105-392, if construed to authorize a judgment, execution and sale&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of an interest in property without the joinder of or notice to the owner thereof, is in conflict with Article 1, Section 17, of the Constitution of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts alleged by defendants are set forth in &quot;A FURTHER ANSWER AND DEFENSE.&quot; Defendants' prayer for relief is that plaintiffs (1) take nothing by reason of their action, (2) that the costs be taxed against plaintiffs, and (3) that defendants have and recover from plaintiffs such other and further relief as defendants may be entitled to receive in the premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To establish title, plaintiffs introduced deed dated September 18, 1937, recorded in Book 100, page 160, Bladen County Registry, which describes and conveys the subject property, executed and delivered by M. M. Sandy and wife, Ethel Sandy, to R. E. Edwards and wife, Annie Belle Edwards, &quot;of Sampson County,&quot; plaintiffs herein.  (It was stipulated that the subject property had been conveyed to A. P. Smith by deed dated April 12, 1882, recorded in Book 4, page 469, said registry.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs then introduced, for the purpose of attack, &quot;the entire proceedings on file in the office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Bladen County in that certain tax foreclosure&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  proceeding entitled '</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bladen County v. R. E. Edwards</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'&quot; and the deeds under which defendants Arnold assert title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tax foreclosure proceeding discloses the facts narrated in the following numbered paragraphs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Tax Collector of Bladen County filed with the said clerk a certificate dated May 4, 1945, setting forth that taxes for the years 1938-1944, inclusive, in the amount of $ 177.38, inclusive of principal, interest, penalties and costs, &quot;are due and owing to the said County by R. E. Edwards&quot; and constitute a lien on the real estate in Turnbull Township, listed in the name of R. E. Edwards, to wit: &quot;125 acres, A. P. Smith land.&quot; This certificate was docketed as a judgment on May 5, 1945.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A minute entry indicates that an execution was issued July 19, 1946. This execution, if issued, is not in the file.  Nothing indicates that any action was taken thereunder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. An alias execution was issued January 25, 1947, which commands the Sheriff of Bladen County &quot;to satisfy the said judgment out of the personal property of the said defendant within your county, or if sufficient personal property cannot be found, then out of the real property in your county belonging to such&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The sheriff's return, dated January 31, 1947, endorsed on said alias execution, consists of these words: &quot;After a due and diligent search R. E. Edwards not to be found in Bladen County.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. An unnotarized purported &quot;Affidavit of Publication&quot; wherein the business manager of The Bladen Journal states that the notice of sale, described in the next paragraph, was published in said newspaper once a week for four consecutive weeks &quot;in its issues of March 13, 20, &amp; 27, and April 3, 1947.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Notice of sale by J. B. Allen, Sheriff, setting forth that, by virtue of an execution directed to him by said clerk in the action entitled &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bladen County vs R. E. Edwards</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; he would, &quot;on Monday, the 7th day of April, 1947, at 12 o'clock p.m., at the courthouse door of said county, sell to the highest bidder for cash to satisfy said execution, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">all the right, title and interest which the said R. E. Edwards, the defendant, has</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the following described real estate, to wit: 125 acres A. P. Smith land in Turnbull Township as listed for taxation for the years 1938, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943 and 1944 in the Public Registry of Bladen County.&quot; (Our italics)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These facts were stipulated: &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (a) By registered letter dated April 12, 1945, to R. E. Edwards, Roseboro, N. C., the tax collector notified said addressee that the certificate described in paragraph 1 above would be filed.  (b) A copy of the notice of sale described in paragraph 6 above &quot;was mailed by the Tax Collector of Bladen County on March 3, 1947, to R. E. Edwards, Roseboro, North Carolina, as provided by law, except the same was not sent by registered or certified mail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By deed dated April 28, 1947, recorded in Book 118, page 403, said registry, J. B. Allen, Sheriff of Bladen County, purported to convey to Bladen County, its successors and assigns, land in Turnbull Township described therein as follows: &quot;125 acres, more or less, A. P. Smith land; being all of the land owned and listed for taxation in the years 1938 through 1944 by R. E. Edwards in said Township, County and state, and being more particularly described in a deed dated the 18th day of September, 1937, from M. M. Sandy, et ux, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">to R. E. Edwards, et ux</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and recorded in Book 100 at page 160, Registry of Bladen County.&quot; (Our italics) This deed recites that the sheriff, pursuant to said judgment and execution, sold the real estate therein described&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on April 7, 1947, and that Bladen County became the last and highest bidder at its bid of $ 253.42.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By deed dated May 5, 1947, recorded in Book 118, page 352, said registry, the County of Bladen, a body corporate, purported to convey to W. P. Smith, his heirs and assigns, the subject property.  The description in this deed consists of that, quoted above, appearing in the sheriff's deed to Bladen County, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">and in addition thereto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the more particular description appearing in the deed dated September 18, 1937, from M. M. Sandy and wife, Ethel Sandy, to R. E. Edwards and wife, Annie Belle Edwards, the latter being the description of the subject property set forth in the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By warranty deed dated March 5, 1956, recorded in Book 133, page 186, said registry, W. P. Smith (single) purported to convey to Floyd J. Arnold and wife, Mary N. Arnold, defendants herein, their heirs and assigns, 1156 acres, more or less, described therein by metes and bounds as a single tract, of which approximately 346 acres is located in Beaverdam Township, Cumberland County, and the remainder is located in Turnbull Township, Bladen County.  It was stipulated that the subject property is within the outer&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  boundaries of the 1156-acre tract described in said deed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence was offered by defendants for the purpose of showing adverse possession by W. P. Smith and later by defendants Arnold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants offered evidence that the property was on the Tax Books of Bladen County &quot;as 125 acres A. P. Smith lands' for the years 1939-1946, inclusive, in the name of R. E. Edwards, Roseboro, N. C., but that R. E. Edwards did not pay the taxes or any part thereof; that the taxes through 1946 were paid out of the proceeds of the sale in 1947 to W. P. Smith; and that the subject property was listed thereafter and the taxes thereon paid by W. P. Smith or Floyd J. Arnold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs offered no further evidence.  No issues were tendered or submitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case on appeal shows: At the close of the defendants' evidence, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">plaintiffs</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> moved for a directed verdict in their favor.  Motion denied.  Plaintiffs excepted.  At the close of all the evidence, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">defendants</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> moved for judgment of nonsuit on the ground that plaintiffs' action was barred by G.S. 1-52(10).  Motion allowed as to plaintiff R. E. Edwards and he excepted.  Motion denied as to plaintiff Annie Belle Edwards and defendants excepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  judgment recites that plaintiffs renewed &quot;said motion&quot; at the close of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">all the evidence;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the court then intimated plaintiffs' motion would be allowed unless the court was convinced that G.S. 105-392 was unconstitutional; and that, by consent, the entry of appropriate judgment was deferred.  The judgment discloses that the court reached the conclusion that G.S. 105-392 was constitutional and valid &quot;insofar as the interest of R. E. Edwards is concerned,&quot; but that, as to the interest of Annie Belle Edwards, said statute is unconstitutional as violative of Article 1, Section 17, of the Constitution of North Carolina, and, as to her, the tax foreclosure proceeding and the sale thereunder are void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judgment contains these adjudications, viz.:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;It is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed that the action be dismissed as to the cause of action of the plaintiff R. E. Edwards, and that he has no interest in said land, and that the defendants' title to his interest in said land is valid and the said R. E. Edwards is barred from any right, claim or interest in the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;It is further ordered, adjudged and decreed that as to the interest of the plaintiff Annabel </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c43">(sic)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Edwards&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  in said land, she is not barred by the sale of said land under execution and that she holds her interest in the same unaffected by said sale and the defendants are not the owners of her interest in said land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;It is ordered that the plaintiff R. E. Edwards pay the cost of this action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff R. E. Edwards and defendants excepted and appealed, assigning as error the respective adverse rulings and adjudications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiffs, husband and wife, appealed and defendants, husband, wife, and county, cross-appealed a judgment from the trial court (North Carolina), which allowed plaintiffs' motion for a judgment of nonsuit at the close of all of the evidence in a civil action under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 41-10 to remove clouds from plaintiffs' alleged title to real property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiffs brought an action against defendants to remove clouds from their title. Defendants alleged that defendant husband and wife acquired title to and owned the subject property under a tax foreclosure proceeding conducted in accordance with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-392, and under certain deeds. Plaintiffs alleged the tax foreclosure proceeding did not comply with the requirements of &sect; 105-392. Defendants offered evidence for the purpose of showing adverse possession by the grantor and by defendants husband and wife. At the close of defendants' evidence, plaintiffs' motion for a judgment of nonsuit on defendants' cross action was denied but it was allowed at the close of all the evidence. The court determined that according to the deed introduced by plaintiffs, the title to the subject property vested in them, as tenants by the entirety. The court held that plaintiffs were deemed to be seized of the entirety, per tout et non per my. Therefore, the court held that plaintiff husband had no divisible interest in the subject property that was subject to sale under judgment and execution against him alone.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants, before entering a plea and before a jury was selected, moved to quash the bills of indictment on the ground that they were violative of Article I, sections 1 and 17, of the Constitution of North Carolina, and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bills charge that the respective defendants &quot;on the 18th day of October, 1958, and more than twelve months prior thereto, and since said date, with force and arms, at and in the County aforesaid, did unlawfully and wilfully, before and since the date aforementioned, place and leave, and caused to be placed and left, temporarily and permanently, trash, refuse, scrap automobiles, trucks, and parts thereof, within 150 yards of a hard surface highway, the same not being concealed from the view of persons on the highway, to wit: Highway No. 74 By-Pass and No. 180, outside of an incorporated town, said condition having existed for more than 12 months and no Justice of the Peace or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  other court inferior to the Superior Court has taken official cognizance thereof, in violation of G.S. 14-399 against the form of the statute in such case made and provided and against the peace and dignity of the State.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendants were junk yard operators, engaged in the business of buying scrapped or wrecked automobiles, salvaging the parts therefrom, and selling them to the general public. Before entering a plea and before a jury was selected, defendants moved to quash the bills of indictment on the ground that they were violative of N.C. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 17, and the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-399 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the State argued that if a municipality could regulate junk yards in the exercise of its police power, an act of the General Assembly intended to accomplish the same purpose was not unconstitutional. The court affirmed, concluding that (1) the statute, as it related to junk yards, was enacted solely for aesthetic reasons; (2) in the exercise of the police power by the State or by a municipal corporation, the thing required to be done had to have a real and substantial relation to the object to be attained, otherwise it was an invalid exercise of the police power; and (3) aesthetic conditions alone were insufficient to support the invocation of the police power.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The respondent issued an order suspending petitioner's driver's license, pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 20-16 (a) (5), for a period of six months, from 7 December 1957 to 7 June 1958, based on records of the Department of Motor Vehicles indicating that the petitioner had been convicted of the following offenses: &quot;(1) April 4, 1952, failure to stop for a stop sign.  (2) July 26, 1953, failing to stop for a stop sign.  (3) April 12, 1956, speeding in excess of 55 m.p.h.  (4) March 14, 1957, speeding in excess of 70 m.p.h. (plea of nolo contendere).  (5) September 9, 1957, improper passing.  (6) October 31, 1957, failure to yield the right of way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the request of the petitioner, a hearing upon the suspension order was held at the Department of Motor Vehicles (hereinafter called Department) on 16 December 1957 and as a result thereof the order of suspension was upheld but revised to cover the period from 16 December 1957 to 17 March 1958, the license not having been surrendered to the Department at the time of the hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioner appealed to the Superior Court, pursuant to the provisions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of G.S. 20-25, contending that the acts of the respondent were arbitrary and unfounded in law.  The petitioner did not surrender his driver's license until 31 December 1957.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioner, having perfected his appeal in the Superior Court, moved the court to require the return of his driver's license pending the disposition of the appeal.  The court granted the request and pointed out that the suspension as fixed by the Department would end at least 60 days before the appeal could be heard in the Supreme Court.  The court by consent of the petitioner and the respondent entered an order, dated 13 January 1958, directing that the petitioner's license be returned to him pending final adjudication of the appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause was heard on its merits, on the pleadings, and on facts stipulated by the parties.  Among the stipulated facts pertinent to this appeal, in addition to those hereinabove set out, are the following:</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by M. O. Galloway from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Patton, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, November-December Civil Term 1958 of Buncombe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This proceeding arises from an order entered on 8 April 1958 by the North Carolina Milk Commission instituting a uniform hauling charge per cwt. for each producer delivering milk to Biltmore Dairies, Asheville Plant, regardless of his volume of milk or distance from the plant, to become effective on 1 April 1958.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 18 April 1958 M. O. Galloway, the appellant, a milk producer and a member of Biltmore Producers Association residing in Buncombe County, pursuant to G.S. 106-266.17, appealed from said order to the Superior Court of Buncombe County.  On the same day Judge Zeb V. Nettles, Resident Judge of the Buncombe County Judicial District, acting under the authority vested in him by the same section of the General Statutes, entered a special order staying the enforcement of the order of the North Carolina Milk Commission pending the final adjudication of Galloway's appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to the same section of the General Statutes, the proceeding was placed on the civil issue docket of the Superior Court of Buncombe County, and heard </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> under the same rules as are prescribed for the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trial of civil actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the proceeding came on to be heard before Judge Patton, all the parties stipulated and agreed to a waiver of trial by jury, and that the Judge should find the facts, make conclusions of law, and render judgment.  G.S. 1-184 and 1-185.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The substance of the findings of fact are these:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biltmore Dairy Farms (also called in the Record, Biltmore Dairies, and hereafter to be called Biltmore) is a duly licensed distributor of milk and its products in Area 8, with its processing plant for this area situate near Asheville, Buncombe County.  Area 8 comprises Buncombe, Haywood, Cherokee and a number of other counties in Western North Carolina.  M. O. Galloway, a resident of Buncombe County, is a milk producer, who sells all of his milk to Biltmore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year prior to April 1957 Biltmore notified its producers to install bulk milk tanks on their farms, so that beginning on 1 April 1957 it might load their milk in bulk tank trucks by pumping the milk from the tanks into the trucks.  This system has a number of advantages over the old system of picking up the milk in cans, and has been instituted in recent years by many milk distributors in North Carolina and other states. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On 1 April 1957 the new system went into effect.  To gather the milk, Biltmore had 8 trucks: 7 of which follow regular routes, and one is a relief truck.  The routes were worked out by Biltmore's field man, Mr. Fox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Driver Farnsworth covers routes 1 and 4, and picks up milk from producers in Buncombe and Henderson Counties, particularly in the Fletcher and South Buncombe areas.  Driver Moore covers routes 2 and 16, and the producers on his routes are also in Buncombe and Henderson Counties.  Driver Prince has routes 3, 5, 8 and 15, and the producers on his routes are in Rutherford, McDowell, Haywood, Burke and Buncombe Counties.  Driver Morgan covers routes 6 and 17 with producers in Madison, Buncombe, Transylvania and Henderson Counties.  Driver Edwards covers routes 7 and 10 with producers in Madison, Yancey and Buncombe Counties.  Driver Horton (formerly Driver Corn) covers route 11 with producers in Polk, Rutherford and Spartanburg (South Carolina) Counties.  Driver Harrell has routes 9 and 14 with producers in Yancey and Mitchell Counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The North Carolina Milk Commission (hereafter called Milk Commission) has established a minimum price of $ 6.55 cwt. to be paid by the distributor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the producer for Class I milk f. o. b. the distributor's plant, with lesser prices for lower classes of milk.  The cost of transporting the milk from the farm to the distributor's plant to be paid by the producer.  The transportation of milk from the farm of the producer to the distributor's plant is handled in various ways in North Carolina, e. g. by contract haulers, but in all cases the producer pays for the hauling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since Biltmore began hauling all its producers' milk in April, 1957, it has charged its producers for hauling on the following basis: The cost of operating each of the seven regular trucks is computed and the cost is then allocated among the producers served by that truck so that each producer on the routes served by that particular truck pays the same weight per hundred pounds; however, the rate charged the individual producer varies considerably depending upon the route to which he is assigned.  Biltmore's figures reflect that during the months from April, 1957, to January, 1958, (Exhibit 'A' in the Stipulation) the cost of operating the Farnsworth truck on routes 1 and 4 was $ 11,683.65; 6,912,400 pounds of milk were transported, and thus the rate per 100 pounds&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for producers on routes 1 and 4 was 16.9 cents.  The next lowest rate was charged the producers served by the Moore truck, routes 2 and 16, to wit, 25.8 cents.  The highest rate was charged the producers on the Corn truck, 30.2 cents.  The average rate charged all producers was 26 cents for this period.  The recapitulation of all charges from April, 1957, through October, 1958, (Exhibit 'B-1') reflects a charge of 17 cents on the Farnsworth route, 31 cents on the Corn route and Prince route, with rates on the other routes being 27 cents or 29 cents and the average rate being 26 cents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Under the system of hauling charges made by Biltmore since April, 1957, a number of inequities have resulted.  The producers on the Farnsworth route have been charged 17 cents per cwt. compared to the average rate of 26 cents (Exhibit 'B'); whereas all other producers have been charged more than the average, ranging from 27 cents to 31 cents.  The same two counties were served by the Moore routes and the Farnsworth routes, to wit, Buncombe and Henderson; yet the Moore route producers were charged 27 cents, the Farnsworth producers 17 cents.  The Buncombe County producers who happened to be assigned&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the Prince routes have paid a higher rate (31 cents) than the Yancey and Mitchell Counties producers on the Harrell routes (29 cents) and likewise higher than the Madison, Transylvania and Henderson producers on the Morgan route (27 cents).  The Buncombe County producers on the Moore, Prince, Morgan and Edwards routes have all been forced to pay at least 10 cents more per cwt. than the Henderson County producers on the Farnsworth routes.  Many of the routes touch each other at some point.  Route #11 going to South Carolina goes right past certain producers who are on the Farnsworth low-price routes; likewise, the Morgan route to Transylvania County goes past the farms of certain producers on the Farnsworth routes.  The luck of a certain producer in being assigned to one route as compared to another route may mean a difference of 10 cents to 14 cents per cwt. in his hauling charges, and the evidence showed that Biltmore has on several occasions changed producers from one route to another.  For example, Max Carland was switched from another route to the Farnsworth route, though the location of his farm was not changed, and this resulted in a saving of 10 cents per cwt. on his hauling&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Exhibit 'D' reflects the losses that certain producers on the Farnsworth route would suffer if Biltmore charged all its producers the same price for hauling.  The producers on the Farnsworth route would suffer a loss as indicated; however, all the producers on the other six routes would realize a gain.  The names of two producers were omitted from Exhibit 'D', to wit, Biltmore Dairy Farms' own herd, and the herd of Biltmore's General Manager E. D. Mitchell.  Both these herds were assigned to the Farnsworth route and would lose substantially (9 cents per cwt.) if a change were made from the present system of hauling charges to a system of charging each producer an equal rate per cwt.  The production of the Biltmore herd is about four times that of the second largest producer on the Farnsworth route, to wit, Fairfield Farms, and the production of the E. D. Mitchell herd ranks third ahead of the production of Frank Burgin.  It appears from the figures on Exhibit 'D' that the defendant M. O. Galloway would have been charged an additional $ 73.47 in 1957, and an additional $ 235.93 for the period from January through September, 1958, had Biltmore been charging all producers the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  same price for hauling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biltmore Producers Association, dissatisfied with Biltmore's hauling charges, petitioned the Milk Commission to hold a hearing in respect to these charges.  After the Milk Commission had mailed a notice of such hearing to all milk producers in Area 8, it held a public hearing on 18 March 1958 in the Buncombe County Courthouse.  M. O. Galloway received a notice of the hearing, but did not attend.  At this hearing substantially all who spoke favored a uniform hauling charge for all producers, regardless of route to which the producer is assigned, distance from the plant or volume of milk.  &quot;Following the hearing the Milk Commission ordered Biltmore to cease its existing system of hauling charges and to institute a system of uniform hauling charges per cwt. to all producers for all milk delivered to its Asheville plant on and after 1 April 1958.&quot; Within due time M. O. Galloway appealed to the superior court.  No appeal was taken by any other producer or by Biltmore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge's conclusions of law are stated separately and in substance are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One. The Milk Commission Act, and in particular subsections (b), (c), (d), (g) and (j) of G.S. 106-266.8, give&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ample authority to the Milk Commission (and to this Court upon appeal) to enter an order regulating the charges made by Biltmore for hauling its producers' milk from the farm to the plant.  Without such authority, the delegation of the power to the Milk Commission to fix prices to be paid producers by distributors would be meaningless, inasmuch as a distributor by unreasonable hauling charges could prevent the producer from receiving reasonable compensation for his milk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two. The delegation of this power to the Milk Commission does not contravene either the State or Federal Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three. The present system of hauling charges used by Biltmore is not fair, equitable or reasonable for the reasons set out in the Court's findings of fact.</SPAN></P>

The producer sought review and the court affirmed, finding that the Commission had the authority under the Act to fix the transportation rates for the hauling of milk in the market area and that the order instituted by the Commission did not violate the producer's rights under N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 or the Fourteenth Amendment. The Act delegated to the Commission the authority to designate market areas and to fix uniform transportation rates for milk hauled within those areas in order to assure that distributors did not assess unreasonable rates that could prevent producers from receiving reasonable compensation for their milk product. The power of the Commission was protected from abuse under N.C. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employees and Brotherhood of Railway Signalmen of America, from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Pless, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and a jury, April 21, 1958, Regular Schedule &quot;B&quot; Civil Term, of Mecklenburg, docketed and argued as No. 251 at Fall Term, 1958.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The original plaintiffs instituted this action June 8, 1953, against Southern Railway Company, hereafter called Southern, and sixteen railroad labor organizations, hereafter called defendant Unions.  After amendment to complaint, referred to below, eleven other individuals, as permitted by court order, became additional parties plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs, non-operating employees of Southern, are not members of, and are unwilling to join, any of defendant Unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs alleged that, pursuant to provisions of a contract between Southern and defendant Unions, defendants notified them they would be discharged from their jobs if they did not, by June 15, 1953, join one of defendant Unions and pay to it &quot;fees, dues and assessments&quot;; that the provisions of said contract were &quot;unconscionable and wrongful, contrary to the Constitution, the Common law and the Statutes of the State of North Carolina&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and violative of the rights of the plaintiffs thereunder&quot;; and plaintiffs prayed that defendants be restrained from their threatened enforcement thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 8, 1953, on plaintiffs' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ex parte</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> application, a temporary restraining order was issued; and on June 17, 1953, after hearing, said restraining order was continued in full force and effect until the trial and final determination of the cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, separate answers were filed (1) by defendant Unions and (2) by Southern.  Defendants admitted their execution of a contract dated February 27, 1953, between Southern and other railroad corporations, referred to therein as &quot;Carrier,&quot; and defendant Unions, which provided, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that &quot;all employees of the Carrier . . . shall, as a condition of their continued employment . . . become members of the organization party to this agreement representing their craft or class within sixty (60) calendar days of the date they first perform compensated service as such employees after the effective date of this agreement, and thereafter shall maintain membership in such organization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Unions asserted the validity of said contract, their right to enforcement thereof, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and prayed that the restraining order be dissolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southern prayed that the court &quot;grant its declaratory judgment as to the validity of the Union Shop Agreement . . . and . . . declare the respective rights, status and other legal relations of the parties . . .&quot; Southern is not a party to this appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 1, 1957, (after the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hudson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hanson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decisions, referred to in the opinion,) plaintiffs, as permitted by court order, filed an amendment to their complaint, in which they alleged, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that the periodic dues, initiation fees and assessments which defendant Unions collect from their members and which, unless protected by the court, plaintiffs would be required to pay in order to retain their jobs with Southern, had been, were and would be regularly and continually used by defendant Unions for the following purposes: (1) to carry on and finance insurance businesses, banking businesses and sundry other business enterprises which plaintiffs were not willing to finance or support; and (2) to carry on, finance and pay for political activities directly at cross purposes with the free will and choice of plaintiffs, including the election of candidates for public&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and governmental offices whom plaintiffs oppose and the defeat of other political candidates whom plaintiffs support and the enactment of legislation which plaintiffs oppose and the defeat of other legislation which plaintiffs support.  Plaintiffs alleged that such use of their money by defendant Unions would not be germane to collective bargaining and that to compel plaintiffs against their will to pay money to defendant Unions for such purposes would deprive them of their rights under the First, Fifth and Ninth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereupon, defendant Unions demurred to the complaint, as amended, on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.  After hearing, the court overruled said demurrer; and, based on the facts alleged in said amendment to complaint, entered a new restraining order which remained in effect until the trial at April, 1958, Term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon trial Judge Pless, at the close of plaintiffs' evidence, entered judgment of nonsuit, dismissing the action as to all defendants except Southern and two of defendant Unions, to wit, Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Employees, hereafter called Brotherhood of Railway Clerks, and Brotherhood of Railway Signalmen of America, hereafter called Brotherhood of Railway Signalmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirteen plaintiffs testified.  By reason of their craft or class, twelve were eligible for membership in the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks and one was eligible for membership in the Brotherhood of Railway Signalmen.  Two of the original plaintiffs were no longer employees of Southern.  One of the additional plaintiffs, having become a supervisor, was no longer subject to the union shop agreement.  There was no evidence as to the employment or craft status of the other twenty-one plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gist of plaintiffs' testimony was as follows: (1) They were unwilling to join the union; (2) they opposed (compulsory) membership as a condition for retention of their jobs; and (3) they opposed the use by the union of any of their money (a) for the support or defeat of political candidates and (b) for the support or defeat of legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three plaintiffs (all who were questioned with reference thereto) testified to their opposition to the use by defendant Unions of any of their money to support or finance an insurance or death benefit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the plaintiffs testified concerning the use the unions had made and were making of money collected as periodic dues, initiation fees and assessments, from their members.  Relevant thereto, plaintiffs offered depositions of officials of the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks and the Brotherhood of Railway Signalmen, adversely examined prior to trial, and documentary evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motions for judgment of involuntary nonsuit, made, at the close of plaintiffs' evidence and again at the close of all the evidence, by the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks and by the Brotherhood of Railway Signalmen, were overruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six issues were submitted to the jury.  The jury found that defendant Unions used &quot;dues and fees&quot; (1) in support of or in opposition to legislation, (2) to influence votes in elections to public office, and (3) to make contributions to the campaigns of candidates for election to public office; and that these uses, and the use of a portion of the &quot;dues and fees&quot; in connection with the death benefit system of the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks, were not reasonably necessary or related to collective bargaining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the verdict, the following judgment was entered:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;NOW, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the defendants, and each of them, are hereby restrained and enjoined from placing any compulsion of any nature upon the plaintiffs, individually named as such in the caption of this case, in the course of their employment with the Defendant Railway Company, whereby they, the said plaintiffs, against their free will and choice would be required to join the Defendant Unions, or conform to any rules or disciplines of Defendant Unions, or pay money to said Unions, to wit, the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employees, and the Brotherhood of Railway Signalmen of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;This Order, however, is subject to the following conditions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;The Defendant Unions shall be permitted, upon proper notice to present proof to the Court, not conflicting or inconsistent with the findings of the jury as hereinbefore recited, as to what portion of the periodic dues, initiation fees and assessments, which they desire to collect from the plaintiffs, will be reasonably necessary and related to collective bargaining between the defendant Unions and the plaintiffs' employer, the Defendant Railway Company, and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  upon making of such proof, not conflicting or inconsistent with the findings of the jury as hereinabove recited, to the satisfaction of the Court, this Order shall have no application or force or effect with respect to such portion of such periodic dues, initiation fees or assessments or the imposition and collection thereof under the terms of the contract referred to in the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;The cause is therefore retained for such further hearings, either with or without a jury, and such further Orders as may seem appropriate should the proof referred to above be offered by the defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Defendants pay the costs of this action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Brotherhood of Railway Clerks and the Brotherhood of Railway Signamen excepted and appealed.  When used in the opinion, &quot;defendant Unions&quot; refers only to the two appellants.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendants, employer and unions, challenged a judgment of the trial court (North Carolina) that granted injunctive relief to plaintiffs, non-operating railroad employees, so that they could not be discharged from employment for refusing to join the union. The unions also challenged the denial of their motion for judgment of involuntary nonsuit. The employer had a union shop agreement with the unions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The unions were the exclusive bargaining representatives of all employees of the crafts or classes to which the employees belonged. The employees alleged that the enforcement of the union shop agreement, which required them to pay dues, fees, or assessments, would deprive them of constitutional rights guaranteed by the First, Fifth and Ninth Amendments. The employees objected in part to the use by the union of the mandatory employee contributions to support democratic political issues. The enforcement of the union shop agreement was enjoined by the trial court, until the unions established what portion of the periodic dues, fees and assessments would be reasonably necessary and related to collective bargaining between the unions and the employer. On appeal, the court found that the evidence was insufficient to withstand the unions' motion for judgment of involuntary nonsuit and reversed the judgment. The court determined that the unions merely demanded that the employees pay ordinary periodic dues and initiation fees uniformly required of all members and the employees could still speak or act freely according to their own desires, even if by so doing they disagreed with the unions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, which granted injunctive relief to the employees and denied the unions' motion for judgment of involuntary nonsuit.</SPAN></P>

The court found the legislature intended an insurance company to charge its insured a premium plus tax and the tax when collected and received was to be paid to the Insurance Commissioner. The court found the tax discriminated for the privilege of selecting between two competing insurance companies.

J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at June 16, 1958 Special Term, of Mecklenburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action to recover for personal injury allegedly sustained as proximate result of actionable negligence of defendants in manner stated in the complaint -- duly heard upon motion of Rheem Manufacturing Company to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction over the person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the court, having considered the stipulation of parties, the evidence offered and the record, made the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. This action was instituted by the issuance of a summons on September 27, 1957.  At the same time proceedings in attachment were instituted against the defendant Rheem Manufacturing Company and pursuant to said proceedings a summons in garnishment was issued against Parnell-Martin Supply Company with respect to any indebtedness owed by that company to the defendant Rheem Manufacturing Company.  The answer to the garnishment summons filed by Parnell-Martin Supply Company shows an indebtedness subject to said garnishment proceedings as of September 27, 1957, in the amount of $ 6,852.98.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. The action was removed to the United States District Court for the Western&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  District of North Carolina on petition of two of the defendants but was thereafter remanded to the State Court by order of the United States District Judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. While the action was pending in the United States District Court, the defendant Rheem Manufacturing Company filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">in personam</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and also a motion to dismiss the attachment proceedings.  After remand, the defendant Rheem Manufacturing Company filed a new motion to dismiss appearing in the record in which no attack was made upon the attachment proceedings and upon the hearing in this Court on the motion to dismiss it was stated for the record by counsel for Rheem Manufacturing Company that motion to dismiss the attachment proceedings filed in the Federal Court was abandoned and that the motion to dismiss was confined to the question of jurisdiction to render a judgment </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">in personam</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. That the original summons was returned without service as to the defendant Rheem Manufacturing Company and thereafter, while the action was pending in the United States District Court, the plaintiff caused an Alias Summons to be issued for service on the Secretary of State of North Carolina under&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the provisions of G.S. 55-145 and 55-146, the defendant Rheem Manufacturing Company, not having appointed an agent for service of process in this State.  No question is raised as to the procedure followed in undertaking to comply with the provisions of G.S. 55-146, the question presented being confined to whether or not the facts of the case bring the case within the provisions of G.S. 55-145 and, if so, whether said statute, as applied to the facts, is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. The defendant Rheem Manufacturing Company is a foreign corporation and is not, and never has been, domesticated in North Carolina, is not incorporated under the laws of this State, and is not, and never has been, admitted to do business in North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;6. At the time of the institution of this action, and for some years prior thereto, and up to the present time, Rheem Manufacturing Company has solicited orders in North Carolina for its products to be shipped in interstate commerce from manufacturing or assembling plants in other states to purchasers in North Carolina.  All such sales are solicited by sales representatives who, in some, but not all, cases, reside in North Carolina.  No sales representative&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  has now, nor has had in the past, authority to enter into complete and binding contracts in North Carolina, it being the practice of the company that all sales, before becoming final, must be accepted by the regional sales office which in all cases is located outside of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;7. Employees of Rheem Manufacturing Company received or obtained 784 orders during the Company's last fiscal year or accounting period, for the sale, delivery, or shipment of goods, articles or products by the Company to persons or concerns in the State of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;8. Of the 784 orders referred to in the preceding paragraph, only one order was not accepted by the appropriate office of the Rheem Manufacturing Company, the reason for non-acceptance in that case being that the Company was unwilling to supply the merchandise ordered to the requested specifications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;9. The average monthly dollar volume of Rheem Manufacturing Company sales of goods of all kinds to persons or concerns located in North Carolina during the Company's last fiscal year or accounting period was $ 140,426.16.  As of September 30, 1957, Rheem Manufacturing Company had 57 customers in North Carolina consisting of wholesale&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  purchasers of its products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Under sales practices employed by the Rheem Manufacturing Company as of the time of the institution of this action, when goods, articles and products were shipped or delivered by Rheem Manufacturing Company to customers or purchasers located in North Carolina, all shipments to North Carolina were f.o.b. plant from which shipments were made.  Title to such goods passed at the plant from which shipments were made, which, in each case was outside of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;11. Payments for all goods sold to North Carolina customers are made by remittance through United States mail to offices of Rheem Manufacturing Company outside of North Carolina and the sales representatives do not make collections and are not authorized to receive money for the company in North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;12. The names and addresses of all salesmen and other agents employed by Rheem Manufacturing Company, who, during the last six months of 1957, performed in the State of North Carolina any acts in furtherance of the purposes for which the Company was formed, are as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

John Painter is and was a salesman employed by the Richmond Plumbing &amp; Fixture Division of Rheem Manufacturing Company.  Paul Morris is and was a salesman employed by the Home Products Division of Rheem Manufacturing Company.  Each of said salesmen engages in general sales solicitation for the purpose of obtaining orders from wholesale customers in the Southeastern States in the case of Mr. Landon and Mr. Painter, and in North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee in the case of Mr. Morris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;14. Approximately 60% of the activities of Frank Landon are in North Carolina.  Approximately 50% of the activities of John M. Painter are in North Carolina.  Approximately 65% of the activities of Paul Morris are in North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;15. During the Company's last fiscal year or accounting period, Rheem Manufacturing Company did not make any sales to customers in North Carolina on a consignment basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;16. Neither Rheem Manufacturing Company nor any of its sales representatives does now maintain, nor has in the past maintained, any office&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or place of business in North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;17. Rheem Manufacturing Company purchases goods from suppliers in North Carolina under sales transactions which provide for shipment f.o.b. the supplier's plant in North Carolina, at which point title to such supplies passes to Rheem Manufacturing Company.  The average monthly dollar volume of such purchases of goods of all kinds from persons and concerns located in North Carolina during the company's last fiscal year or accounting period was $ 682.74.  The average number of orders per month involving such purchases was thirty-nine.  These purchases are generally made by purchase orders issued at the plant facilities of Rheem Manufacturing Company outside of North Carolina and transmitted by mail to the supplier in North Carolina.  In relatively few instances representatives of the supplier visit plant facilities of Rheem Manufacturing Company outside of North Carolina and secure purchase orders on the occasions of such visits.  Under no circumstances do employees of Rheem Manufacturing Company make agreements of purchase in North Carolina for such supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;18. On September 30, 1957, the total amount of indebtedness owed to Rheem Manufacturing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Company by persons or concerns located in North Carolina was $ 247,099.38.  Rheem Manufacturing Company did not have any interest in any tangible property located in the State of North Carolina during September 1957, except price sheets, specification sheets and sales promotion literature such as is normally carried by salesmen.  The only property which Rheem Manufacturing Company owned, or in which it had an interest in North Carolina, at any time, consisted of the indebtedness due from its North Carolina customers, goods in transit purchased from North Carolina suppliers as outlined in Finding No. 17 above, and price sheets, specification sheets and sales promotional literature, such as is normally carried by salesmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;19. Rheem Manufacturing Company has now, and had at the time of the institution of this action, and at all times alleged in the complaint, no employee situated in North Carolina except the sales representatives specifically named in other findings of fact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And upon the foregoing findings of fact and upon the record, the court made the following conclusions of law:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. Service of process was had upon the defendant Rheem Manufacturing Company in this case in full&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  compliance with the procedural requirements of G.S. 55-146, as authorized by G.S. 55-145 (c).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. The cause of action stated in the complaint against Rheem Manufacturing Company arises out of a transaction which falls within the terms of G.S. 55-145 (a) (3), and accordingly, the service which was had in this case under G.S. 55-146 brought the defendant Rheem Manufacturing Company within the jurisdiction of this Court for purposes of an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">in personam</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. The activities which the Rheem Manufacturing Company has carried on in this State through its employees and agents have been throughout the period in question, regular, systematic and continuous and have resulted in a large volume of interstate business between said Company and persons and concerns in this State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. The cause of action stated in the complaint against Rheem Manufacturing Company arises out of the activities of the said Company referred to in the preceding paragraph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. The activities of the Rheem Manufacturing Company carried on in North Carolina as above stated establish such direct, substantial and uninterrupted contacts by that Company with this State as to make it reasonable and just for this Court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to exercise its jurisdiction over said Company in this case as authorized by G.S. 55-145 and 146.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;6. Under all of the facts contained in the record before this Court, no right of the Rheem Manufacturing Company under the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution or under Article I, Section 17 of the North Carolina Constitution will be violated by this court's exercise of the jurisdiction conferred upon it by G.S. 55-145 over said Company.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore the court &quot;ordered, adjudged and decreed&quot; that the special appearance and motion to dismiss filed herein by defendant Rheem Manufacturing Company be, and it is hereby overruled, and defendant is allowed specified time within which to file answer or otherwise plead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the signing and entering of the foregoing order, the defendant Rheem Manufacturing Company objects and excepts, and appeals to the Supreme Court, assigning error.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant foreign manufacturing company challenged an order of the trial court (North Carolina) overruling the company's special appearance and motion to dismiss plaintiff injured party's action. The company alleged that its 14th Amendment rights would be violated by the trial court's exercise of jurisdiction over it. The trial court found that it had jurisdiction over the company pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 55-145.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The injured party lived in North Carolina. The company was a foreign corporation engaged in manufacturing, producing, and assembling gas water heaters for use in the home. Through the efforts of its agents residing and working in North Carolina, the company had shipped large quantities of water heaters to North Carolina with the expectation that they would be installed and used in the homes of people residing in North Carolina, and they were so used. The acts of negligence upon which the injured party based her cause were allegedly brought about through the negligence of the company in manufacturing and producing a defective gas water heater, which it caused to be shipped into North Carolina where it was installed and used in the injured party's home until, by reason of the defect, a gas explosion occurred. Affirming, the court held that, upon the undisputed facts, the cause of action arose out of activities described in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 55-145(a)(3). Thus the trial court had authority, so far as the provisions of the statute were concerned, to assert jurisdiction over the person of the company in the case. Further, the court held that the statute was constitutional as applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Froneberger, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at Chambers in Charlotte, North Carolina, 4 August 1958.  From Mecklenburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff, a citizen and resident of the City of Charlotte, North Carolina, instituted this action in behalf of himself and other property owners and taxpayers in said city, seeking to enjoin the defendant City of Charlotte, its Mayor and City Council, from issuing General Obligation Bonds to finance the extension of water, sewer and fire alarm services into the territory to be annexed to the City of Charlotte, from and after 31 December 1959, prior to said date of annexation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause was heard pursuant to stipulations entered into by the parties by Froneberger, J., assigned to hold the courts of the Twenty-Sixth Judicial District, without a jury.  A jury having been waived, the hearing was held at Chambers in Charlotte, North Carolina on 4 August 1958, and it was agreed that the court should find the facts and make its conclusions of law and enter judgment accordingly.  The trial judge found the facts, made his conclusions of law and entered judgment, denying the plaintiff the relief demanded, except the defendants were enjoined from extending fire&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  alarm service for more than two miles from the corporate limits of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 23 May 1957 the General Assembly of North Carolina enacted Chapter 802 of the 1957 Session Laws, amending the charter of the City of Charlotte so as to provide for the extended boundaries of said city.  The Act provided for an election to be held on 15 July 1957 among the qualified voters of the City of Charlotte and the adjacent territory proposed to be annexed to said city; and further providing that if the election carried, the city limits of said city should be extended, as set out in the Act, from and after 31 December 1959.  The special election was held and the extension of the city limits duly approved, and it is conceded that the election was properly called and conducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The territory to be annexed pursuant to said election comprises approximately thirty square miles, so that the area of the City of Charlotte will be substantially doubled by said extension of the city limits.  The area to be annexed has a density of population of 1,357 per square mile, or a total population of approximately 41,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 6 of Chapter 802 of the Session Laws of 1957 provides: &quot;Should said election carry, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the City of Charlotte is hereby authorized and empowered to plan for extending and to extend, municipal public works into the territory coming into the city limits by virtue of said election.  The City of Charlotte is granted the right to acquire the necessary lands in connection with such public works and to acquire property in connection therewith by condemnation, if necessary, under the present law governing condemnation of property within the present city limits of the City of Charlotte, which said law is hereby extended to cover such added territory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 12 March 1958 the City Council of the City of Charlotte enacted an ordinance duly authorizing, subject to the approval of the voters, the issuance of $ 1,301,000 water bonds, $ 3,265,000 sanitary sewer bonds, and $ 134,000 fire alarm system bonds, for the purpose of providing funds for enlarging and extending such services within and without the city limits, including the territory to be annexed; and providing for a sufficient tax to pay the principal and interest on said bonds to be annually levied and collected.  At the same time, said Council also duly adopted a resolution calling for a special bond election on 26 April 1958, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and approved notice of such special bond election and an official ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is conceded that the election was duly called and conducted and that the qualified voters of the City of Charlotte approved the issuance of said bonds, including the levy of a tax to pay the interest and principal on such indebtedness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The budget of the City of Charlotte for the fiscal year 1 July 1958 to 30 June 1959, as adopted by the City Council of the City of Charlotte on 16 July 1958, provides for the payment of approximately $ 62,158.00 in interest and bank commissions on said bonds during the current fiscal year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 16 July 1958 the City Council of the City of Charlotte levied a tax on all real and personal property in said city in order to raise the funds necessary to meet said interest and bank commissions.  The defendants admit they intend to issue said bonds for the extension of said services to the territory to be annexed prior to 1 January 1960, and will, in addition to the tax heretofore levied to pay interest and bank commissions as hereinabove set out, levy a tax prior to 1 January 1960 for the payment of principal and interest on said bonds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff taxpayers appealed a decision of the trial court (North Carolina) that entered judgment in favor of defendants, the City of Charlotte, North Carolina, and its officials, in the taxpayers' action for injunctive relief. The taxpayers sought to enjoin the City and its officials from issuing bonds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The City wanted to issue bonds and to levy and collect taxes in order to finance the extension of water, sewer, and fire alarm services into a territory to be annexed to the City in 1960. The taxpayers contended that the City did not have such authority because it constituted a taking without due process and the expenditures were not for a public purpose. The taxpayers initiated an action. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the City and its officials but held that it could not extend the fire alarm system beyond two miles from present City limits under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160-238. In affirming the judgment, the court found that the issuing of bonds to extend water and sewer systems was not in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160-239 authorized the City to establish and maintain a sewer system. 1957 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 802, &sect; 6 authorized the City to annex the territory and to plan to extend public works to such territory. The expenditure of funds for the construction of water and sewerage facilities by the City, outside its corporate limits, if done pursuant to legislative authority, was for a public purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant railway company sought review of a judgment from the Forsyth County Superior Court, Twenty-First District (North Carolina), which granted the request of plaintiff city for a writ of mandamus. The writ ordered the railway company to rebuild an overpass trestle over a city street at the railway company's entire expense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The railway company had paid for the construction of the overpass trestle when the city had created a new street. Years later, the city passed an ordinance requiring the railway company to rebuild the trestle so that a new city street could intersect with the older street. The city claimed that its charter granted it the power to force the railway company to rebuild the trestle, and the trial court agreed. The court reversed, though, holding that the city's claimed power was unconstitutional and void. The city's requirement that the trestle be rebuilt was not based upon public safety considerations. Instead, the trestle was to be rebuilt solely as a public convenience to relieve traffic congestion in other parts of the city. Furthermore, the railway company would not receive any direct benefit from the rebuilding of the trestle. The court ruled that requiring the railway company to bear the entire cost of the project was an invasion of the railway company's property rights and a violation of due process under N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. The court noted that this was not a grade separation issue, nor was the trestle an obstruction to traffic on the existing street.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court held that the granting of the writ of mandamus by the trial court was in error, and the court remanded the case to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

From Franklin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a taxpayers' suit to enjoin the issuance by the defendants of proposed school building bonds in the amount of $ 350,000 for improvements and new buildings at Mills School in the Town of Louisburg, as approved by vote of the people in an election held in the special tax district in which the school is located.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record discloses these facts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The defendants propose to issue the bonds under the provisions of Ch. 1078, S. L. 1957, which applies to Franklin County only.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Pursuant to this statute and in reliance upon the procedure prescribed by it, the Board of Education of the County created a special bond tax district, designated as &quot;The Louisburg Township Special Bond Tax District of Franklin County,&quot; the boundaries of which are coterminous with the boundaries of Louisburg Township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. On petition of the Board of Education, the Board of County Commissioners caused a special election to be held in the District, permitting the voters of the District to vote &quot;For&quot; or &quot;Against&quot; the proposed bond issue and the levying of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a sufficient tax for the payment thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. At the special election so held a majority of the votes cast were in favor of the bond issue and the tax levy.  The returns have been duly canvassed and declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The County Board of Education and the Board of County Commissioners have complied with the procedural requirements of Ch. 1078, S. L. of 1957, respecting all matters in connection with the creation of the special tax district and the election held on the question of the issuance of the bonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. It is proposed to issue the bonds in the name of Franklin County, to seal them with the county seal, and to cause them to be signed by the Chairman of the Board of County Commissioners and attested by the Register of Deeds of the County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is proposed that the following provisions, among others, will be incorporated in the bonds: &quot;The County of Franklin . . . hereby promises to pay . . . from the proceeds of taxes levied ad valorem on taxable property within The Louisburg Township Special Bond Tax District of Franklin County as now constituted, . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This bond is issued by virtue of and in pursuance of Chapter 1078 of the Session Laws of 1957, for the purpose of acquiring, erecting, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  enlarging, altering and equipping school buildings, including a gymnasium, agricultural buildings, shop, cafeteria . . . and purchasing sites therefor at the Mills School situated in the Town of Louisburg in said District . . . .  The issuance of this bond and the contracting of the indebtedness evidenced thereby have been authorized at an election duly held in The Louisburg Township Special Bond Tax District of Franklin County and resolutions of the Board of Commissioners of Franklin County duly adopted. . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This bond and the interest thereon are payable exclusively out of taxes to be levied in The Louisburg Township Special Bond Tax District of Franklin County and the full faith and credit of the said District and the taxing power of the said County as applicable to said District are hereby irrevocably pledged for the punctual payment thereof.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Ch. 1078, Sec. 6, S.

In the preceding fiscal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  year which began on 1 July, 1956, and ended on 30 June, 1957, the outstanding indebtedness of Franklin County was reduced from $ 128,000 to $ 122,000, and during the interval from 1 July, 1957, to the date of the hearing in March, 1958, the indebtedness of the county was further reduced $ 1,200; that the question of the issuance of the bonds has not been submitted to the voters of the entire county, and the defendants do not propose to submit it to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The plaintiffs are residents and taxpayers of Louisburg Township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The gravamen of the complaint is (1) that by virtue of the clause in Sec. 6, Ch. 1078, S.L. 1957, which provides that the Board of County Commissioners &quot;may pay from county funds any part of the principal and interest of the bonds,&quot; any bonds issued under the Act will pledge, or purport to pledge, the faith and credit of Franklin County and will be, or purport to be, debts of Franklin County, payable in such part and to such extent as the Board of Commissioners of Franklin County shall from time to time determine, from any and all funds of Franklin County, including funds other than taxes levied upon property in the Special Tax District; (2) that the proposal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to issue the bonds has not been submitted to the voters of the entire county; and (3) since the proposed issue far exceeds the amount by which the outstanding indebtedness of the county was reduced during the preceding fiscal year, the issuance of the bonds as contemplated by the defendants is and would be in excess of their authority and would be contrary to the provisions of Article V, Section 4, of the Constitution of North Carolina and, further, that the bonds, if issued, would be illegal and invalid and the levy and the collection by the defendants of any tax upon the properties of the plaintiffs for the payment of the bonds would be unlawful and in excess of the authority of the defendants, and would constitute a taking of the property of the plaintiffs, and others similarly situated, contrary to the law of the land, in violation of Article I, Section 17, of the Constitution of North Carolina, and without due process of law, in violation of the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court below upon facts agreed and facts found, substantially as hereinbefore set out, made conclusions of law in substance as follows: (1) that the Board&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Commissioners of Franklin County, under authority of Ch. 1078, S. L. 1957, and the proceedings duly had pursuant to the Act, has the power and authority to issue the bonds for the purposes stated; (2) that the bonds will be issued by the Board of County Commissioners on behalf of the Louisburg Township Special Bond Tax District of Franklin County, to be payable exclusively out of taxes to be levied in such District; (3) that the Board of County Commissioners has the power to levy annually and collect a special tax, ad valorem, on all taxable property in the special bond tax district sufficient to pay the bonds, principal and interest, as same becomes due and payable; (4) that the bonds, when issued and sold, will not be debts of Franklin County but will be valid obligations of The Louisburg Township Special Bond Tax District of Franklin County only, and shall be payable exclusively out of taxes to be levied in such District; (5) that the issuance and sale of the bonds and the levy and collection of the special tax annually, ad valorem, on all taxable property in the special tax district sufficient to pay the principal and interest of the bonds as same shall become due and payable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  will not be unlawful and will not constitute a taking without due process of law or contrary to the law of the land of the property of the plaintiffs and others similarly situated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">A special tax district was established within the county, and the voters living in such district approved at a special election the issuance of school building bonds. The taxpayers filed an action to enjoin the county commissioners from issuing such bonds; they alleged that, based upon the language of 1957 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 1078, &sect; 6, the commissioners could use general county funds to pay for such bonds and that the statute was therefore unconstitutional because the matter was not submitted to the voters of the entire county. The trial court dismissed the taxpayers' action, and the court affirmed. It held that when issued, the bonds would only be debts of the special tax district, payable exclusively out of taxes to be levied in the district. The court noted that the bonds would not be debts of the county and could not be paid in any part out of county funds, unless and until payment was assumed by the county commissioners under the procedure outlined in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115-109 and in conformity with applicable constitutional limitations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action against the Commissioner of Revenue of the State of North Carolina to recover taxes paid under protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action was heard upon an agreed stipulation of facts, the parties by their attorneys having in writing waived a jury trial.  A summary of the agreed stipulation of facts follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One.  Plaintiff, a Delaware corporation, with its principal office in Johnson City, Tennessee, is a common carrier of freight for compensation by motor vehicles in interstate commerce only between the States of North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia and Tennessee, except that in the State of Tennessee it also engages in intrastate business.  All of its interstate business is authorized, permitted, supervised and directed under the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission in accordance with the Federal Motor Carrier Act of the Congress of 1935, and amendments thereto (U. S. C. A., Title 49, Sec. 301 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), and the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution (U. S. Const., Art. I, sec. 8, (3)).  Its intrastate business in Tennessee is under the jurisdiction of the Tennessee Public&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Service Commission.  It has no offices in North Carolina, except such as are incident to its motor freight terminals, which are necessary for its interstate operations in this State.  It has never been domesticated in North Carolina.  It has never been authorized by North Carolina to do intrastate business.  All of its business in North Carolina is now, and always has been, exclusively interstate in character.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two.  The purpose of the action is to recover from the defendant income taxes in the sum of $ 15,812.80 paid to the State of North Carolina under protest by plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three.  The income taxes, which the defendant required the plaintiff to pay, were levied pursuant to the provisions of G.S. Ch. 105, Art. 4, and in particular Sections 105-134 and 105-136 of said chapter and article.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four.  Plaintiff owns no real estate in North Carolina, but rents and maintains freight terminals in various places in the State solely for its interstate operations.  These terminals are manned by employees of plaintiff, who usually live in the State, and whose duties pertain only to its interstate activities.  Plaintiff hauls into North Carolina interstate freight only by its interstate motor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  vehicles.  Plaintiff owns no personal property in North Carolina, except pickup and delivery trucks, together with furniture, fixtures and equipment necessary for its terminals.  These pickup and delivery trucks are licensed in North Carolina.  When freight is received at its various terminals in the State, it is delivered to the consignees, either direct from the interstate motor vehicles, or in delivery trucks stationed at the respective terminals.  Its delivery trucks pick up interstate freight from its customers destined for or consigned to points or parties outside of North Carolina, and take it to its terminals.  There such freight is billed and loaded into its interstate trucks, and transported to destinations outside of North Carolina.  Usually when a full truckload of freight is shipped to or from any customer in North Carolina, its interstate trucks go to the customer's place of business.  Sometimes such truckloads go by the terminals when it is too late to deliver the freight at night, or to get started, or when a Sunday or a holiday intervenes.  In the case of less than truckload shipments, its pickup trucks gather freight from its customers for assembly into full truckloads&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at its various terminals in the State.  These pickup trucks act as a part of its interstate shipments of freight.  Plaintiff does not handle any purely intrastate shipments of freight in North Carolina.  The only freight plaintiff handles is that which either originates outside of North Carolina, or is destined outside of the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five.  During its fiscal year from 1 July 1954 to 30 June 1955, plaintiff paid rentals on its terminals in North Carolina in the amount of $ 21,911.00.  During its same fiscal year, it paid in North Carolina the following taxes:</SPAN></P>

During its fiscal years ending 30 June 1955 and 30 June 1956, the interstate motor vehicles which plaintiff operated were largely based and taxed in Tennessee, and used Tennessee license plates in its operations under reciprocal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  agreements between Tennessee and the other States in which it operated, by which the interstate motor vehicles are to be taxed and licensed in the carrier's domicile or principal place of business.  Under the reciprocal agreement between North Carolina and Tennessee, plaintiff, for its fiscal year ending 30 June 1955, paid license plate taxes to Tennessee for its interstate motor vehicles in the sum of $ 71,886.38.  During its fiscal year from 1 July 1955 to 30 June 1956, plaintiff paid the same rentals on its terminals in North Carolina, and substantially the same amount of taxes in North Carolina, as it did during its preceding fiscal year, and also paid substantial rentals and taxes in other States in which it operated, except Virginia, and license plate taxes to Tennessee on its interstate trucks in the amount of $ 78,589.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six.  On 31 August 1954 defendant requested in writing that plaintiff furnish him certain information, and explain why it had not filed state income tax returns.  On 9 September 1954 plaintiff furnished in writing the information requested, and stated it was not subject to income tax to North Carolina.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven.  On 3 January 1955, at plaintiff's request, a hearing was held in defendant's office, at which plaintiff presented evidence, and contended it was not subject to the payment of income tax to North Carolina.  On 17 June 1955 defendant rendered a decision directing plaintiff to file state income tax returns.</SPAN></P>

After paying the tax under protest, the taxpayer brought an action against the Commissioner, claiming the tax constituted a burden on interstate commerce and violated due process. After the trial court found for the Commissioner, the taxpayer sought review, and the court affirmed. The court held the income tax had not burdened interstate commerce as a tax upon a franchise to engage in interstate business within the state because the tax had been derived solely from income that was earned within the state by reason of interstate business and that was reasonably attributable to interstate business done within the state's borders.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiffs from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bickett, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, November, 1957 Civil Term, Wake Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action was instituted under G.S. 1-253,-257 for the purpose of having the court pass on the constitutionality of Chapter 1420, Session Laws of 1957 - the North Carolina Firemen's Pension Fund Act.  The plaintiffs are five insurance companies authorized to do business in North Carolina and now engaged in writing all types of fire and lightning insurance coverage in this State.  The defendant Charles F. Gold is Commissioner of Insurance of North Carolina.  The defendants Henry L. Bridges, I. Miller Warren, Charles F. Gold, Berry C. Gibson and Curtis H. Flanagan constitute the Board of Trustees of the North Carolina Firemen's Pension Fund.  The defendant North Carolina Firemen's Association is a private voluntary group composed of firemen, both regular and volunteer.  The defendant C. R. Puryear is a regular full time paid fireman of the City of Raleigh.  The defendant Ray E. Scott is a volunteer fireman of the Town of Apex, rated Rural Class A by the Southeastern Underwriters Association.  The defendants Puryear and Scott are designated representatives of all firemen in their respective&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  classes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs, in crucial substance, allege the Firemen's Pension Fund Act requires that: (1) All purchasers of fire and lightning insurance in protected areas must pay an additional one per cent of the premium to the insurer to be transmitted to the Commissioner of Insurance, who, in turn must pass it on to the State Treasurer who shall be the custodian of the fund and shall disburse it to eligible firemen on the vouchers signed by two trustees of the fund.  Purchasers of fire and lightning insurance from &quot;farmers mutual fire associations&quot; are not required to make the payments.  (2) A number of insurance companies in competition with the plaintiffs are treating the Pension Fund Act as invalid and unconstitutional, and are refusing and will continue to refuse to collect and account for the additional premiums to the great financial disadvantage and irreparable injury of the plaintiffs.  Insurance agents writing policies for a number of different companies are necessarily giving preference to the companies that refuse to require the payment of the additional charge.  This practice results in a daily loss of business and is placing the plaintiffs at a competitive disadvantage, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  thereby causing them irreparable injury for which the law does not provide a remedy.  (3) The Pension Fund Act gives special privileges and emoluments to certain firemen only, to the exclusion of other firemen and other employees, and delegates to Southeastern Underwriters Association, a private organization, the right to classify towns and rural fire districts and determine eligibility for participating in the fund without fixing standards for the classification.  The Act discriminates against the plaintiffs in favor of farmers mutual fire insurance companies -- plaintiffs' competitors -- in that they are exempt from the provisions of the Act.  (4) The Act is in violation of Article I, Sections 7 and 31, Article II, Section 14, and Article V, Section 3, of the Constitution of North Carolina, and of the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.  (5) The duties assigned to the Commissioner of Insurance and to the Treasurer of North Carolina are ministerial only and require them to transmit and disburse the fund to private persons of a special class, and that this action is, therefore, not against the State.  (6) The Pension Fund Act does not provide any method&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for the recovery of money paid by the plaintiffs under the provisions of the Act.  (7) The plaintiffs have complied and are complying with the provisions of the Act for the reason that they prefer not to incur the danger of the heavy penalties provided for noncompliance.  By this action they seek to settle the uncertainty and turbulence in the business of providing fire and lightning insurance in protected areas brought about by the attempt of the plaintiffs to comply with the Act and a refusal on the part of other companies so to do, to the great competitive disadvantage and loss of business to the plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint contains other material allegations as well as amplification of those here summarized.  The plaintiffs invoke the equitable power of the court to determine by declaratory judgment the constitutionality and validity of Chapter 1420, Session Laws of 1957, and allege that a speedy hearing to that end is in the public interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants filed a demurrer asking the &quot;complaint&quot; be dismissed on five grounds: (1) The plaintiffs are not the real parties in interest and do not have the legal capacity to maintain this action.  (2) There is a defect of parties defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in that Puryear and Scott and the North Carolina Firemen's Association have no interest in the subject-matter of this action.  (3) That the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action in that no tax has been assessed or collected, or liability fixed against the plaintiffs.  (4) The court has no jurisdiction to entertain this action against the State which has not consented to be sued.  (5) The court is without jurisdiction to determine by declaratory judgment the matters set out in the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the hearing, the court sustained the demurrer and entered a judgment dismissing the action.  The plaintiffs excepted and appealed.  </SPAN></P>

Defendants challenged the right of the insurance companies to maintain the action; the jurisdiction of the court to hear it; and the sufficiency of the complaint to state a cause of action. The trial court sustained their demurrer and dismissed the action. The court concluded the allegations were sufficient to require they should be answered to end the issues and reversed the judgment of the superior court sustaining the demurrer. Further, the court found that the allegations of the insurance companies qualified them as persons under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-265, and that under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-253, the insurance companies had the right to challenge the constitutionality of the Pension Fund Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Sharp</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Special Judge, at 10 February, 1958, Civil Term of Wake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action to test the constitutionality of the Firemen's Pension Fund Act, Chapter 1420, Session Laws of 1957, codified as G.S. 118-18 through 118-37, heard below on motion for judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Act creates a pension plan for certain eligible firemen in North Carolina.  The plan is to be financed in part by a charge of 1% of the premiums on fire and lightning insurance on property &quot;in areas where fire protection is available.&quot; The Act requires the charge to be passed on to the purchasers of insurance in the form of an additional charge for insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff, William S. Bizzell, obtained a policy of fire insurance from the defendant, Great American Insurance Company.  The policy insured the plaintiff's home located in the City of Raleigh.  The Insurance Company required the plaintiff to pay, pursuant to the Firemen's Pension Fund Act, a charge of 1% of the fire and lightning insurance premium in addition to the regular premium.  The additional charge amounted to fifty cents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, the plaintiff instituted this action, alleging that the Firemen's Pension Fund&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Act is unconstitutional on five specific grounds, and demanding refund of the additional premium charge of fifty cents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the Great American Insurance Company, the following were made parties defendant: Charles F. Gold, Commissioner of Insurance, who is charged by the Act with the duty of collecting from the insurance companies the additional charges made for the benefit of the Pension Fund; the five individuals who constitute the Board of Trustees of the Pension Fund, namely: Henry L. Bridges, I. Miller Warren, Charles F. Gold, Berry C. Gibson and Curtis H. Flanagan; C. R. Puryear, a paid fireman from the City of Raleigh, as class representative of all paid firemen in North Carolina; and Ray E. Scott, as class representative of all volunteer firemen in the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the defendants except the Great American Insurance Company filed a demurrer to the complaint.  The demurrer was directed to procedural and jurisdictional aspects of the case rather than to the merits of the constitutional attack made upon the Act in the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 18 December, 1957, by order of Judge Bickett, Resident Judge of the Tenth Judicial District, the demurrer was sustained, and the action was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  dismissed as to the demurring defendants.  There was no appeal from the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter the Great American Insurance Company, which had originally answered the complaint, filed an amendment amplifying the allegations of the answer and setting forth additional facts respecting some of the allegations of the complaint previously admitted.  The answer as amended makes only technical denial of the plaintiff's allegations wherein it is averred that the Act is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next, the plaintiff moved for judgment on the pleadings.  At the conclusion of the hearing on the motion, the presiding Judge, being of the opinion that no issue of fact is raised by the pleadings and that the challenged statute is unconstitutional for the reasons set out in the complaint, entered judgment declaring the Act unconstitutional and void.  From the judgment entered, the defendant appeals.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant insurer appealed the decision from the Civil Session of Wake County (North Carolina), which entered a judgment on plaintiff insured's motion for a judgment on the pleadings declaring the Firemen's Pension Fund Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 118-18 to 118-37&nbsp;unconstitutional and void. The insured filed suit to declare the Act unconstitutional and demanded a refund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The Act created a pension plan for firefighters financed in part by a charge on premiums for fire and lightening insurance. The insured obtained a policy. In his suit, there were other named defendants, including an insurance commissioner, but they filed a successful demurrer to the action. The court on appeal dismissed under the rule that a court would not pass on the constitutionality of a statute where there was no antagonist interest between the parties. The insurer was the plaintiff in another suit involving the same issues. The same other defendants in the action herein were the defendants in the other action. The insurer also admitted that the statute probably was unconstitutional and that it would pay the premium. The attorneys who appeared in the trial court as amici curiae appeared in that role before the court. In summary, the parties had no real dispute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At January Term 1957 the jury returned verdict of Guilty.

I, &sect; 7, in that the punishment was contrary to the general law throughout the state. The trial court arrested the judgment on the ground stated and discharged defendant. The State claimed that there was no general law making public drunkenness a crime and thus the judgment should stand. In reversing, the court held that: (1) where there were 17 different sub-sections of the statute, each of which prescribed a different punishment and each of which included one or more counties, there were in effect 17 different statutes, each pertaining to a relatively small group; (2) the history of the statute indicated that the legislature intended to enact piecemeal local legislation and thus there was no general law in conflict with &sect; 14-335; and (3) the enactment of local legislation on public drunkenness was a valid exercise of the state legislature's police powers as the local statutes applied alike to all persons with the locality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action to enjoin defendants from continuing certain acts alleged to constitute violations of GS 90-71 and GS 90-72.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury trial was waived.  The parties submitted the case upon an AGREED STATEMENT OF FACTS, which, in material part, was as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;FIRST: . . . the plaintiff North Carolina Board of Pharmacy is . . . the duly constituted agency of the State . . . for the purpose of regulating the practice of Pharmacy in . . . North Carolina, . . . and as such agency is authorized to sue in its name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;SECOND: At all times herein referred to, the defendant W. Ronald Lane . . . owned and operated a drugstore known as Lane's Brooklyn Pharmacy, wherein he employed the defendant John W. Baldwin for the performance of certain duties and services in the prescription department thereof as assistant to and under the direct control of registered pharmacist R. E. Miller. . . .  The defendant W. Ronald Lane also owned and operated two other drugstores, to wit, Lane's Market Street Pharmacy, and Lane's Lake Forest Pharmacy, all . . . located in the City of Wilmington, North Carolina.  For the purpose&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of performing the functions of compounding and dispensing prescriptions, selling drugs and medicines, and complying with the laws relating to the practice of Pharmacy, . . . the defendant W. Ronald Lane, as owner and operator of the said three drugstores . . ., employed three registered pharmacists in full and complete charge of the prescription departments of these three stores on a schedule of work so that there were at least two registered pharmacists on duty in at least two of the said drugstores at all times who could be contacted by telephone or by messenger delivery, for consultation and assistance concerning any prescription to be compounded or otherwise filled in any one of the said three stores, but that on the occasions mentioned in the complaint, none of the said registered pharmacists, or any others, were contacted with regard to the 'prescription' on which this action is based.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;THIRD: Under and by virtue of Chapter 90 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, the plaintiff North Carolina Board of Pharmacy has delegated to it by the General Assembly of North Carolina the duties and authority set forth therein, including the duty to carry out the purposes and to enforce&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the provisions of the said Chapter 90.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;FOURTH: Neither the defendant W. Ronald Lane nor the defendant John W. Baldwin are, or have ever been, either registered pharmacists or assistant pharmacists, within the meaning that the said terms are used in the said Chapter 90 . . .; but the defendant John W. Baldwin, prior to 5 August 1954, had had over 14 years' experience in filling and compounding prescriptions as an aid to and under the supervision of registered pharmacists in the said Brooklyn Pharmacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;FIFTH: The 'prescription' which was presented to the defendant John W. Baldwin on 5 August 1954 and on which this action is based, and referred to in paragraph 5 of the complaint as amended, is as follows:</SPAN></P>

Ronald Lane, while the registered pharmacist was temporarily off the premises, received the above set forth 'prescription' for the purpose of supplying the tablets called for therein, and did then and there take from a large size container labeled with the trade name of the said tablets and containing a larger quantity of tablets the number of tablets called for by the said prescription, put the said specified number of tablets in a smaller container which was then delivered to the 'customer,' and received the purchase money from the 'customer.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;SEVENTH: The 'prescription' mentioned in paragraph 6 above did not have to be compounded or prepared from a combination of ingredients, but consisted of tablets which had been previously prepared by the manufacturer thereof, and which tablets were themselves ready for delivery to and use by the ultimate consumer except for removal from their container.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;EIGHTH: The facts set forth in paragraphs 6 and 7 above, with relation to the occurrence on 5 August 1954, are the same facts as occurred 'at various other times' referred to in paragraphs 5&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and 6 of the complaint as amended; and on none of the occasions referred to in the complaint, and on which this action is based, did the defendants, or either of them, have to compound, or prepare by mixing various ingredients, the items called for by the said 'prescription,' but merely removed the prescribed number of tablets called for in the said prescription by their trade name from the stock bottle ready prepared by the manufacturer and delivered them to the ultimate consumer in the quantity specified on the said prescription.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As to the tablets called for in the prescription set forth in paragraph 5 above, they are a drug within the meaning of the use of that term in Sections 90-71 and 90-72 of the General Statutes of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ELEVENTH: The facts set forth in the foregoing paragraphs 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, with regard to the 'filling' of prescriptions and operations of drugstores constitute a course of conduct which has, from time to time over a period of many years, been the common practice in a great many of the drugstores throughout the State of North Carolina.

The trial court granted the board's request for an injunction prohibiting any unlicensed person from dispensing prescription medicines. On appeal, the court modified and affirmed, holding that: (1) the fact that the employee had over 14 years' experience in filling and compounding prescriptions, as an aid to and under the supervision of registered pharmacists, was irrelevant; and (2) the employee was not &quot;under the immediate supervision&quot; of a registered pharmacist located at one of the owner's other pharmacies, as the exception provided by &sect; 90-71 contemplated that his services were to be rendered &quot;as an aid to&quot; as well as &quot;under the immediate supervision of&quot; a licensed pharmacist.The court did modify the injunction by striking from the judgment the phrase &quot;or performing any thing or act in violation of the provisions of General Statutes, Chapter 90,&quot; which it considered too broad.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Conclusions of Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. That the requirement by the Registrar of Seaboard Precinct and by the Northampton County Board of Elections, in application of the provision of Section 163-28 of General Statutes of North Carolina, as amended, that the said Louise Lassiter be able to read or write any section of the Constitution of North Carolina, as a prerequisite to being registered as a qualified voter is unlawful, the same being in violation of Article VI, Section I of the Constitution of North Carolina, and in violation of the 14th, 15th, and 17th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff voter appealed a judgment from the Northampton County Superior Court (North Carolina) that affirmed the decision of respondent election board, which denied the voter the right to register because she refused to read sections of the North Carolina Constitution and thereby failed to submit to an education test that was required by N.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The voter contended that &sect; 163-28 was unconstitutional by reason of a conflict with the suffrage provisions of the North Carolina Constitution and denied her equal protection. The court determined that the literacy requirement of the statute was an appropriate exercise of the authority of the legislature and was consistent with N.C. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1 (1946) and N.C. Const. art. VI, &sect; 4, which required a literacy test as a requirement for the voter to register to vote. The court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 163-28 (amended 1957) did not violate U.S. Const. amends. XIV, XV, or XVII because there was no discrimination based on race, creed, or color.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendants from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Moore (Dan K.), J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 19 July 1957 at Chambers, Mecklenburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On application of plaintiff, a temporary restraining order issued by Judge Huskins enjoining defendants from picketing or interfering with plaintiff or its subcontractors.  On the return day Judge Moore heard the evidence offered, made findings of fact, and thereupon continued the restraining order until the final hearing on the issues raised by the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a basis for the restraining order the complaint alleged: Plaintiff, a Delaware corporation, has a place of business at Charlotte where it is engaged in manufacturing guided missiles under a contract with the United States.  Defendants are unincorporated labor organizations and authorized representatives thereof.  Plaintiff's plant is located on a tract containing 78 acres which is completely surrounded by a chain-link fence.  Many of the processes used by plaintiff and its subcontractors and the manufactured products produced by plaintiff are classified by the Government as secret and are vital to the security of the United States.  Plaintiff is responsible for safeguarding this information and the missiles and parts thereof produced&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on its Charlotte property.  To provide the required secrecy plaintiff controls all entrances and exits to its grounds and supervises the movement of personnel within the area.  On said tract are buildings occupied by other contractors performing work for the Government incidental to plaintiff's work, but plaintiff has exclusive responsibility for and control of all entrances to and exits from the grounds for security purposes.  The Corps of Engineers of the Army entered into a contract with Boyd &amp; Goforth, Inc., a construction firm, for the erection of buildings on the 78-acre tract.  This contract is intended to facilitate the construction of guided missiles.  No dispute exists between Boyd &amp; Goforth and its employees.  Defendants established a picket line at all the gates and entrances to the land occupied by plaintiff and its subcontractors.  The picket lines carry signs or banners inscribed &quot;Unfair to Building Trades&quot; without identifying the person or corporation so accused.  There is no labor dispute between plaintiff or its subcontractors and their employees, and said picketing is not predicated on any controversy between them; but the picketing is the result of a conspiracy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  intended to compel plaintiff to deny admittance to the grounds by nonunion employees of Boyd &amp; Goforth, thereby requiring Boyd &amp; Goforth, as a condition to the performance of its contract with the Government, to confine its employment to members of defendant unions in violation of G.S. 95-78&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As planned and anticipated by defendants, many of plaintiff's employees and many employees of its subcontractors have refused to cross the picket line established by defendants, and plaintiff has been hampered in the performance of its contract to supply the United States with guided missiles.  Defendants had no legal right to picket plaintiff's property when no controversy existed between it and its employees.  Defendant Henderson acknowledged this fact but stated that he proposed to cause as much trouble as possible to force Boyd &amp; Goforth to employ union labor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants filed an answer admitting the relationship of the parties and plaintiff's contract with the United States.  They denied the allegations as to the cause for picketing.  They allege that defendant unions had contracts with plaintiff for the performance of certain phases of the work done by plaintiff.  They aver controversies&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  arose between plaintiff and defendant unions with respect to these contracts, and the picketing was to force compliance by plaintiff with the provisions of the contracts between plaintiff and defendant unions.  They further allege that Boyd &amp; Goforth were discriminating against defendant unions in that it hired and employed nonunion members &quot;for the sole reason that they were non-union, and did wrongfully and unlawfully encourage and influence the said employees not to join with defendant unions . . .&quot; Defendants allege the picketing was peaceful, plaintiff was engaged in interstate commerce, and the National Labor Relations Board had exclusive jurisdiction of the controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time fixed for the return of the temporary order, defendants moved to dismiss for that the court was without jurisdiction.  This motion, treated as a demurrer, was overruled.  Thereupon the court heard evidence both </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">parol</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and by affidavit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court, on the evidence offered and the stipulations of the parties, found: (1) Plaintiff is an industry or business engaged in commerce within the meaning of that term as used in the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947.  (29 U.S.C.A. 141 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">); (2) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the facts stated in the complaint are true; (3) there has been no mass picketing, and the picketing has been peaceful.  It was on these findings that the court continued the restraining order to the final hearing.  Defendants excepted to the order and appealed.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the corporation a temporary restraining order, which enjoined the labor organizations from picketing or interfering with the corporation. On appeal, the court reversed. The Supreme Court of the United States, having final authority to ascertain congressional intent, had declared that it was the intention of Congress in the enactment of the Labor Management Act, Taft-Hartley Law, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 141 et seq, to exclusively pre-empt the field of labor management relations in interstate commerce and to remove the matter from the jurisdiction of state courts.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The promoter filed an action to permanently enjoin the competitor from interfering with the promoter's racetrack. A temporary restraining order was issued. The superior court also determined that 1957 N.C. Sess. Laws 588 was constitutional. On review, the court noted that equity jurisdiction could be exercised to enjoin the threatened enforcement of a statute that contravened the North Carolina Constitution. The court found that 1957 N.C. Sess. Laws 588 was a local act. The court also stated that there was no general statutory law in North Carolina that authorized or regulated the promotion of automobile races on privately owned racetracks. Therefore, the court held that the common law applied to automobile races on privately owned race tracks under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-1. In addition, the court determined that the act in question was not concerned with the act of racing but was aimed at the person responsible for racing events. Therefore, the court held that the act was in conflict with N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 29 and was void because the act regulated a trade or business for profit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs seek a judgment declaring that none of their alleged actions violates Art. 7, Sec. 7, or Art. 5.  Sec. 4, or Art. 1, Sec. 7, or Art. 1, Sec. 17, or Art. 2, Sec. 1, or Art. 5, Sec. 3, of the Constitution of North Carolina, or the provisions of G.S. 160-399(d).  No reference to any of said constitutional and statutory provisions appears in the pleadings except in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">plaintiffs' prayer for relief</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answering, defendant admitted all of plaintiffs' allegations except paragraph XIII wherein plaintiffs alleged: &quot;. . . that the Redevelopment Commission of Greensboro is a duly constituted agency of the City of Greensboro; that it and the City Council are authorized by the laws and ordinances hereinabove referred to and pleaded herein to proceed with the redevelopment plan above described and to spend public money on said project and that the laws and ordinances above referred to and pleaded herein are valid and constitutional exercises of the legislative power of the General Assembly of North Carolina and the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  City Council of the City of Greensboro.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs are (1) the City of Greensboro, a municipal corporation, (2) the individuals who comprise its City Council, (3) the Redevelopment Commission of Greensboro, a separate and distinct body corporate and politic, and (4) the individual members of the Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint, summarized, alleges:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City Council of Greensboro, by ordinance of October 15, 1951, created the Redevelopment Commission.  Upon the filing of a certified copy of this ordinance in his office, the Secretary of State issued a charter to the Redevelopment Commission.  Thereupon the City Council appointed the members of the Commission.  Its organization was completed by the election of officers, adoption of bylaws, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 13, 1955, the Planning Board of Greensboro, at the request of the Commission, certified a described area within the corporate limits as a &quot;redevelopment area.&quot; Thereupon the Commission prepared a comprehensive &quot;redevelopment area plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission &quot;is proceeding with a proposal for the redevelopment of the area, which includes the proposed redevelopment contract, with the developer selected; that monies have been and will be expended&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the development of said plan and that the development of said plan cannot proceed further without expenditure of substantial sums.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City Council, by resolution, expressed its desire that the Commission prepare plans and surveys to carry out &quot;an urban redevelopment project&quot; and &quot;agreed that the City of Greensboro would provide an amount in cash, streets, utilities, etc., which will not be less than one-third of the net project cost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attached exhibits show the metes and bounds of the &quot;redevelopment area&quot; and the various projects and features of the &quot;redevelopment area plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant is a citizen, resident and taxpayer of Greensboro.  On July 26, 1957, he wrote a letter requesting that the City Council &quot;take proper steps to have . . . determined by the courts of North Carolina&quot; whether plaintiffs' actions or proposed actions would be in violation of any of the constitutional and statutory provisions referred to above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judgment recites that a jury trial was waived and the cause heard on &quot;the pleadings, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">affidavits</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and exhibits&quot; (our italics); and based thereon the court made extended </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">findings of fact</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.

The court concluded that consideration and decision of the several questions suggested by the citizen relating (1) to the powers of the redevelopment commission, and (2) to the limitations upon the city in respect of the appropriation of tax funds and the issuance of municipal bonds for &quot;redevelopment&quot; purposes, had to be deferred until actions either of the commission or of the city were properly and specifically challenged by a person directly and adversely affected thereby.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action to restrain the City of Asheville from putting into effect an ordinance which provides a higher rate for consumers of water living outside the City than that charged to consumers residing in the City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts essential to an understanding of the questions involved on this appeal are stated below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Between 1923 and 1927, pursuant to various Acts of the Legislature, there were formed in Buncombe County six water and sewer districts.  These districts were duly incorporated by the Legislature as municipal corporations for the purpose of furnishing to the residents of the respective districts water and sewer service.  By the provisions of the various Acts of the Legislature, the districts were given geographical boundaries and were authorized to acquire rights of way for water and sewer lines, to construct such lines, and to hold elections authorizing the issuance of bonds in payment therefor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The six districts issued bonds as follows: South Buncombe Water and Watershed District -- $ 400,000.00 5 1/2% Water and Sewer Bonds, dated 1 May 1927.  Swannanoa Sanitary Water District -- $ 1,723,000.00&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  5 1/2% Water and Sewer Bonds, dated 1 July 1927, and $ 150,000.00 6% Water and Sewer Bonds, dated 15 May 1929.  Beaverdam Water and Sewer District -- $ 500,000.00 5% Water and Sewer Bonds, dated 1 September 1927.  Caney Valley Sanitary Sewer District -- $ 66,000.00 6% Water and Sewer Bonds, dated 1 May 1927.  Hazel Ward Water and Watershed District -- $ 48,000.00 6% Water and Watershed Bonds, dated 1 November 1926.  Venable Sanitary District -- $ 45,000.00 6% Water Bonds, dated 1 January 1928.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Each respective district was created and organized and the Board of Commissioners of Buncombe County made trustees thereof, pursuant to the following Acts of the General Assembly: (a) South Buncombe Water and Watershed District -- Chapter 501 of the 1925 Public-Local Laws of North Carolina, and Chapter 246 of the 1927 Public-Local Laws of North Carolina.  (b) Swannanoa Sanitary Water District -- Chapter 249 of the 1927 Public-Local Laws of North Carolina, and Chapter 139 of the 1931 Public-Local Laws of North Carolina.  (c) Beaverdam Water and Sewer District -- Chapter 135 of the 1927 Private Laws of North Carolina.

(e) Hazel Ward Water and Watershed District -- Chapter 501 of the 1925 Public-Local Laws of North Carolina, and Chapter 235 of the 1927 Public-Local Laws of North Carolina.  (f) Venable Sanitary District -- Chapter 237 of the 1927 Public-Local Laws of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each plaintiff listed below is a citizen of Buncombe County and resides in the district hereinafter indicated and is a consumer of water, whose property is connected to one of the water mains of the district on which he resides, to wit: P. Morton Keary, South Buncombe Water and Watershed District; Tom Cole, Swannanoa Sanitary Water District; Frank Lowe, Beaverdam Water and Sewer District; Mrs. Nell Busch, Caney Valley Sanitary Sewer District; Hoyt Spivey, Hazel Ward Water and Watershed District; and W. E. Creasman, Venable Sanitary District.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Board of Commissioners of Buncombe County as ex officio trustees of such municipal corporations or districts enumerated herein, are charged with the management, operation and control of each of such corporations, and have the power, as such trustees, to do all things necessary for the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  successful operation of water and sewer systems, including purchasing of land, rights of way, laying of pipes, and such other things as may be necessary for the successful operation of sewer and water systems in said districts, including the maintenance thereof.  The Board of Commissioners, as such, and not as trustees, is authorized and directed by the Special Acts to levy annually a special tax in the respective districts for the maintenance of the water and sewer systems located therein, and to levy annually in each district a tax sufficient to pay the principal and interest due on the bonds issued by such district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. That for the year 1954-1955, the following were the debt service levies for said districts: South Buncombe Water and Watershed District -- $ 8,189.00 -- 15.40 cents per $ 100 valuation.  Swannanoa Sanitary Water District -- $ 45,280.00 -- 20.70 cents per $ 100 valuation.  Beaverdam Water and Sewer District -- $ 2,268.00 -- 13.10 cents per $ 100 valuation.  Caney Valley Sanitary Sewer District -- $ 1,850.00 -- 29.00 cents per $ 100 valuation.  Hazel Ward Water and Watershed District -- $ 2,300.00 -- 12.30 cents per $ 100 valuation.  Venable Sanitary District -- $ &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1,300.00 -- 16.00 cents per $ 100 valuation.  That for prior years said County Commissioners have levied varying amounts for said debt service but generally comparable to the figures above stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. That for the year 1954-1955, the levy for maintenance and upkeep of said lines and systems for each of the districts was as follows: South Buncombe Water and Watershed District -- $ 12,500.00 -- 18.60 cents per $ 100 valuation.  Swannanoa Sanitary Water District -- $ 44,500.00 -- 19.50 cents per $ 100 valuation.  Beaverdam Water and Sewer District -- $ 3,800.00 -- 19.90 cent per $ 100 valuation.  Caney Valley Sanitary Sewer District -- $ 1,400.00 -- 16.00 cents per $ 100 valuation.  Hazel Ward Water and Watershed District -- $ 2,100.00 -- 9.70 cents per $ 100 valuation.  Venable Sanitary District -- $ 2,200.00 -- 15 cents per $ 100 valuation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 205 of the 1929 Private Laws of North Carolina, the corporate limits of the City of Asheville were enlarged and extended so as to include within the extended corporate limits of the City portions of the territory embraced within the boundaries of the Beaverdam Water and Sewer District, the South Buncombe&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Water and Watershed District, and the Swannanoa Sanitary Water District.  The City of Asheville, as required by Section 8 of the above Act, assumed the payment of a portion of the bonded indebtedness of said districts in proportion to the percentage the assessed valuation of the territory annexed to the City of Asheville bore to the assessed valuation of the entire territory of said districts.  As of 1 July 1936, the date of the refunding of the bonded indebtedness of said districts, the City of Asheville had assumed the following percentages and amounts of the bonded indebtedness incurred by said districts: The percentage of the indebtedness in the Beaverdam Water Sewer District was 86.043, and the amount was $ 430,215.00; the percentage in the South Buncombe Water and Watershed District was 39.6765, and the amount was $ 158,706.00; the percentage in the Swannanoa Sanitary Water District was 27.7688, and the amount was $ 538,839.00.  As of 1 July 1949, the City of Asheville assumed the proportionate percentage and amount of the outstanding indebtedness of the Caney Valley Sanitary Sewer District, which had been included within the territorial limits of the City of Asheville, as follows: &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  25.68253, and the amount of $ 12,841.27.  As of 1 July 1955, the outstanding indebtedness of the four districts referred to in this paragraph was $ 1,742,000.00, of which the City of Asheville had assumed $ 713,304.89.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. That since the assumption by the City of Asheville of the indebtedness hereinabove set out, the City of Asheville has levied anually an ad valorem tax on all the taxable property in the City of Asheville of a sufficient rate to pay the principal and interest of that part of said indebtedness of said districts so assumed, as required by Section 8 of Chapter 205 of the 1929 Private Laws of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. It is stipulated by the parties to this action that, for the fiscal year ending 30 June 1956, 5,983 water meters were in operation in the said water districts outside the City of Asheville; that the individual consumers residing in the districts purchased and installed these meters at an average initial cost of $ 40.00 per meter; that the City of Asheville served on the above date, in and outside its corporate limits, a total of 20,977 water meters; that the revenue during the year indicated from the meters located outside the City was $ 285,483.00, and all revenue&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from the sale of water through all the above meters was $ 1,056,703.00, and the total cost of billing and meter reading was $ 85,365.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. It is also stipulated that the City of Asheville has, over a long period of years, beginning over fifty years ago, invested in a waterworks system a sum in excess of ten million dollars, which system consists of watersheds comprising approximately thirty square miles in area, located on the North Fork of the Swannanoa River and on Bee Tree Creek in Buncombe County, at a distance of approximately fifteen miles from the City of Asheville, impounding dams, chlorinating plants, pumping installations, transmission lines from said watersheds to the City of Asheville, reservoirs and a network of distribution lines operated and maintained by large maintenance crews and personnel employed by the City of Asheville, which waterworks system was originally for the primary purpose of providing the citizens of Asheville with an adequate supply of wholesome water for domestic and industrial purposes and for fire protection.  It is further stipulated that, including the water bonds issued by the City of Asheville on 1 December 1951, in the sum of $ 2,750,000.00, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the combined unpaid indebtedness of the City for the waterworks system as of 30 June 1955 was $ 6,404,593.44.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Prior to the year 1928, the City of Asheville sold water in bulk under its ordinances to certain of said water districts, by means of metering the same through one or more master meters located in one or more districts, and such districts paid the City therefor at rates provided for bulk sales of water, and the districts sold the water at retail prices to the individual consumers and did its own billing and collecting.  In 1928, this method was abandoned and the City of Asheville thereafter sold water directly to the individual consumers in the districts and billed the individual consumers on the basis of rates then in effect under its ordinances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. On 29 February 1928, the City of Asheville adopted an ordinance which reduced the rates to customers outside its corporate limits but still charged a rate to outside customers double that charged customers inside its corporate limits.  Effective as of 25 August 1930, the City of Asheville increased its water rates to both its inside and outside customers, still leaving the cost to outside customers double that charged to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  customers living within its corporate limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. That the General Assembly of North Carolina, at its 1933 session, enacted Chapter 399 of the 1933 Public-Local Laws, reading as follows: &quot;Section 1. That from and after the passage of this Act, it shall be unlawful for the City of Asheville, or any of the governing authorities, agents, or employees thereof, to charge, exact, or collect from any resident of Buncombe County, whose property is now connected or may hereafter be connected with the main of any water district which has paid or issued bonds for the payment of the expense of laying such main, a rate for water consumed higher than that charged by the City of Asheville to persons residing within the corporate limits of said City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 2. That the City of Asheville is hereby specifically authorized and empowered, through its officers, agents and employees, to cause any user of water who shall fail to pay promptly his water rent for any month to be cut off, and his right to further use of water from the city system to be discontinued until payment of any water rent in arrearages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 3. That it is the purpose and intent of this Act to declare that persons residing outside&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the corporate limits of the City of Asheville shall be entitled to the use of Asheville surplus water only, and the governing body of the City of Asheville is authorized and empowered to discontinue the supply of water to any districts, or persons, out of the corporate limits of the City of Asheville at any time that there may be a drought or other emergency, or at any time the governing body of the City of Asheville may deem that the city has use for all of its water supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 4. That it shall be the duty of the County Commissioners of Buncombe County and/or trustees of the different water districts operating outside of the corporate limits of the City of Asheville, in Buncombe County, to maintain the water lines in proper repair, in order that there may not be a waste of water by leakage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. That after the passage of the above Act, the City of Asheville billed consumers of water in the various districts at the same rate as that charged consumers of water living inside the City of Asheville, until 1 September 1955.  That on 11 August 1955, the City Council of the City of Asheville enacted Ordinance No. 383, to be effective as of 1 September 1955, establishing rates for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  outside consumers substantially higher than those charged its consumers within its City limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the foregoing finding of facts by the court below, it was concluded as a matter of law that (a) Chapter 399 of the 1933 Public-Local Laws of North Carolina is unconstitutional and void and is contrary to the Constitution of the State of North Carolina and the Constitution of the United States of America, and particularly is in violation of Section 17 of Article I of the Constitution of North Carolina and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America, and other applicable provisions of said Constitutions; (b) that the defendant, City of Asheville, is not estopped to assert the invalidity of Chapter 399 of the 1933 Public-Local Laws of North Carolina; and (c) that Ordinance No. 383 enacted by the City Council of the City of Asheville, on 11 August 1955, and every section thereof, is in all respects lawful and valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judgment was entered accordingly, the temporary restraining order theretofore entered was dissolved, the action was dismissed and the plaintiffs directed to pay the costs of the action to be taxed by the Clerk.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiffs, county commissioners and water consumers, appealed from a judgment of the trial court, Buncombe County (North Carolina), which dismissed its complaint against defendant city to restrain the city from putting into effect an ordinance that provided a higher rate for consumers of water living outside the city than that charged to consumers residing in the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The city passed an ordinance in which it charged county residents living outside the city a higher rate for the water it supplied. Plaintiffs brought an action to restrain implementation of the ordinance. The trial court ruled for the city and dismissed their complaint. The court reversed the judgment below, ruling that the ordinance was valid as applied to persons outside the city but not within a district that established and maintained at its own expense the water or water and sewer system. The ordinance was invalid insofar as it established a different rate for persons within the county water districts and persons within the city limits. While the legislature authorized the city to sell water to consumers outside the city limits, the legislature had the power to fix the sale terms and those terms had to be fair and just. The applicable statute, 1933 N.C. Sess. Laws 399 was constitutional and binding on the city with regard to persons who obtained water through mains constructed and maintained at the expense of the taxpayers in those districts. The city ordinance providing for higher rates for those persons was, therefore, invalid as to persons who maintained their own systems.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant was tried in the Recorder's Court of Benson, North Carolina, upon a warrant issued by the clerk of said court, charging that the defendant on or about 3 March 1957 did unlawfully and wilfully operate a motor vehicle upon the public highways of the State of North Carolina and upon the public streets of the Town of Benson, while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or narcotic drugs; and that he, Murray B.

Sess. Laws ch. 998, however, struck out &quot;Johnston&quot; from the list of excepted counties. The court stated that 1953 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 998 was tantamount to a re-enactment of the general law making it applicable to Johnston County. It had been decided in a similar case that this was not a local, private, or special act in violation of N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 29. Next, the court rejected defendant's argument that the recorder's court did not have jurisdiction to try cases involving criminal acts committed outside its corporate limits. The court had held to the contrary in other cases.</SPAN></P>

From Cleveland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a civil action brought by a taxpayer of Cleveland County in which, as plaintiff, he seeks to restrain the Board of Commissioners of said County (hereinafter called Board of Commissioners) from issuing and selling bonds in the amount of $ 310,000 for the purpose of constructing a water distribution system, and the issuance and sale of bonds in the amount of $ 105,000 for the purpose of constructing a sewer system, pursuant to the provisions of the County Finance Act as set out in Article 9 of Chapter 153 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, as amended by Chapter 266 of the Session Laws of 1957.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A special bond election was duly called, to be held on 28 September 1957, and the plaintiff, in the court below, also sought to restrain the holding of the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff alleges that Chapter 266 of the Session Laws of 1957 is unconstitutional and invalid for that: (a) it authorizes bonds for the construction of water and sewer systems, and that these are not proper county purposes; (b) the statute violates Article I, Section 17, of the Constitution&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of North Carolina, by depriving persons in Cleveland County of their property without due process of law; (c) the statute violates the equal protection of the law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and Article I, Section 5, of the Constitution of North Carolina; (d) the statute is invalid on its face because it authorizes a bond issue for purposes other than a public purpose; and (e) the statute is unconstitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board of Commissioners, in its answer, admitted its intention to issue the bonds described herein and for the purposes set out in the complaint, and denied the allegations of the complaint to the effect that it is without legal authority to do so.  It alleges further that there are areas in Cleveland County without proper water and sewer service; that such condition is jeopardizing the health, safety, and welfare of its inhabitants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties waived a jury trial and agreed that his Honor should hear the matter in Chambers and make his findings of fact and conclusions of law based on the pleadings and any other evidence that might be offered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court made the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. That certain rural&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  areas in Cleveland County are at the present time without proper water and sewer service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. That the lack of proper water and sewer service is jeopardizing the health, safety, and welfare of the County and its inhabitants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. That it would be to the public interest for Cleveland County to provide the necessary water and sewer facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. That in 1957 the General Assembly of North Carolina in regular session passed House Bill No. 462 entitled: 'An Act Amending the County Finance Act to Authorize the Issuance of Bonds by Counties for Water Systems and Sanitary Sewer Systems and Fixing the Maximum Maturities of Such Bonds and Amending Section 153-9 of the General Statutes to Authorize Counties to Acquire, Construct, Operate, Lease and Dispose of Water Systems and Sanitary Sewer Systems and to Contract for the Operation and Lease of Such Systems and for a Supply of Water and the Disposal of Sewage.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. That since the passage of the said 1957 Act by the General Assembly of North Carolina the defendants, as the Board of Commissioners, have acted in reliance on it, in reliance on Section 153-9 as amended of the General Statutes of North Carolina, and in reliance on the County&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Finance Act, as amended (G.S. 153-69, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), and have set out to determine the will of the people concerning the issuance of bonds for the purpose of providing proper water and sewer facilities for certain areas of Cleveland County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;6. That all of the actions of the said Board of Commissioners leading up to the final passage of an order authorizing $ 310,000 Water Bonds and an order authorizing $ 105,000 Sanitary Sewer Bonds, and all of their actions in calling for an election on September 28, 1957, to determine the will of the qualified voters of the County regarding the issuance and sale of such bonds have been in accordance with the General Statutes of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;7. That there are no controverted issues of fact in this case and the only issues are issues of law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the foregoing findings of fact, the court concluded as a matter of law: (1) That the construction of the proposed waterworks and sewer systems is a proper county purpose.  (2) That the issuance of bonds for the construction of the aforesaid systems would not deprive the citizens of Cleveland County of their property without due process of law or deprive them of the equal protection of the law.  (3) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That the authority pursuant to which the Board of Commissioners is acting does not violate Section 5 or Section 17 of Article I of the Constitution of North Carolina or the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.  (4) That Chapter 266 of the 1957 Session Laws of North Carolina authorizes the issuance of bonds for purposes which are public purposes.  That the aforesaid amendment to the County Finance Act is valid and constitutional on its face.  Whereupon, judgment was entered denying the plaintiff's prayer for an injunction to restrain the Board of Commissioners from holding the proposed bond election and issuing the proposed water and sewer bonds, dismissing the action, and directing that the plaintiff pay the costs to be taxed by the Clerk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff appeals, assigning error.  </SPAN></P>

Contending that 1957 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 266 was unconstitutional, the taxpayer sought to restrain the Board from issuing and selling the bonds. The trial court found for the members. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that 1957 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 266 gave counties the power to acquire, construct, reconstruct, extend, improve, operate, maintain, lease, and dispose of water systems and sanitary sewer systems, to contract for the operation, maintenance, and lease of such systems, and to contract for a supply of water and the disposal of sewage. The court found that the construction of a water distribution system and a sewer system was for a public purpose. The court held that 1957 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 266 was constitutional and that the general assembly was entitled to grant counties the authority to issue bonds for the construction of water and sewer systems when approved by a majority of those who might vote on it in any election held for such purpose.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant was charged in a warrant with reckless driving (G.S. 20-140), and was tried in the Municipal Court of the City of High Point.  From a verdict of guilty and prison sentence imposed, he appealed to the Superior Court.  Before pleading to the merits of the case, the defendant moved both in the Municipal Court and in the Superior Court to quash the warrant, on the ground that Chapter 703, Session Laws of 1949, under which the warrant was issued by a police sergeant of the City of High Point, is unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant was charged in a warrant with reckless driving. Defendant filed a motion to quash the warrant because a police sergeant had issued it. The trial court granted the motion. The court affirmed on appeal. The court held that the power to issue warrants was conferred generally upon certain designated judicial officers and other persons by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-18. Other judicial officers were authorized to issue warrants by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-198. These statutes did not confer upon police sergeants the power to issue warrants. The court rejected the State's argument that an amendment to the city charter permitted the police sergeant to issue warrants. The court found that the act had been repealed, and thus, there was no act to be amended. The amendment was a nullity. The court held that regardless of the reason by the trial court in quashing the warrant, the decision to do so was correct. Accordingly, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint alleges that plaintiff is the owner of a lot in Hamlet which she specifically describes, that the defendants are also asserting title thereto, that plaintiff and defendants trace title to a common source, that plaintiff's chain of title which is detailed in the complaint is superior to defendants' chain of title which is likewise detailed in the complaint.  She prays that she be adjudged the owner in fee simple, and the claim asserted by defendants be declared a cloud on her title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants answered, admitting that they claim title to the lands described in the complaint, basing their claim on the deeds referred to; that they purchased the property in good faith and for value; that plaintiff's claim is based on a mortgage conclusively presumed by G.S. 45-37(5), as amended in 1945, to have been paid prior to their purchase.  They pray that they be adjudged the owners and plaintiff's claim adjudged a cloud on their title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury trial was waived.  The court found the following facts: On 16 August 1921, Minnie Mae Pate was the owner of the land in controversy.  On that date she&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  executed a mortgage in usual form conveying said lot to W. H. H. Bagwell, J. R. Gordon, and E. L. Sanford to secure an indebtedness of $ 800 payable in installments, the last of which became due 16 December 1928.  The mortgage was duly recorded in December 1922.  On 11 May 1923 Bagwell and Sanford made a marginal entry on the recorded mortgage reading: &quot;For value received we hereby transfer and assign the within mortgage deed from N. J. Pate and wife, to J. R. Gordon without recourse.&quot; The mortgage has never been foreclosed.  On 25 April 1925, J. R. Gordon individually executed a warranty deed in regular form to S. Alexander Gregg purporting to convey the lot in controversy.  This deed was recorded 25 May 1926.  On 21 December 1927, S. Alexander Gregg executed a deed to plaintiff purporting to convey this lot.  The deed to plaintiff was recorded 23 February 1927 (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">).  On 3 June 1950, Minnie Mae Pate conveyed the land in controversy by regular warranty deed to Glyde M. Pate.  The deed was recorded 7 June 1950.  Revenue stamps on the record indicate the consideration was $ 1,000.  On 4 May 1951, Glyde M. Pate and wife, by general warranty deed, conveyed the land to defendants who&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  paid $ 1,500 therefor.  The lot is unimproved.  No one has actual possession.  Taxes have been paid thereon by plaintiff and those under whom she claims and taxes have likewise been paid by defendants and those under whom they claim.  No affidavit by the holder of any of the notes secured by the mortgage from Minnie Mae Pate to Bagwell, Gordon, and Sanford has ever been filed for record in Richmond County nor has any marginal entry ever been made on the record of said mortgage indicating that any part of the debt originally secured remains unpaid.  Glyde M. Pate and defendants employed counsel to examine the title to the property before they made their respective purchases, and they were furnished by their counsel certificates that the property was free and clear of all encumbrances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on his findings of fact, the court concluded as a matter of law that the notes secured by the mortgage of 16 August 1921 were, as to the defendants, presumed to have been paid and that the defendants had good title to the land.  Thereupon judgment was entered adjudging the defendants the owners of the lands in controversy and directing the register of deeds to make marginal entry on the record of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the mortgage from Minnie Mae Pate to Bagwell and others that it was canceled by the judgment rendered.  Plaintiff excepted to the judgment and appealed.  </SPAN></P>

The register of deeds was directed to make a marginal entry that the claims of others were cancelled. Plaintiff contended that she was the owner in fee simple.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff claimed to be the owner of a lot to which defendants also asserted title, and the parties traced title to a common source. The lot was unimproved, and no one had actual possession. Taxes were paid by both parties. The court found that when the mortgagor executed her mortgage in 1921 to several mortgagees to secure payment of her note, the legal title vested in the mortgagees, but only as security for payment of the debt, creating a joint tenancy. The court noted that assignment by the mortgagees only transferred the debt. The court opined that as none of the mortgagees was dead, the deed from one of them to plaintiff could not be valid as a foreclosure deed even if it purported to be one. Conceding that one of the joint tenants had the right to convey his interest, which was held only as security for the debt, the court concluded that his grantee was a mere trustee chargeable with a duty and responsibility to both the equity redemption owner and the owner of the instrument-secured debt. As plaintiff did not claim to be the owner of the mortgage notes and did not assert any right to them, the court held that plaintiff was not a party aggrieved and had no right to appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court dismissed plaintiff's appeal due to lack of standing as plaintiff was not the aggrieved party in the real estate dispute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This proceeding originated before the North Carolina Utilities Commission upon the petition of the State Department of Archives and History, hereinafter called the applicant, for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to the end that lands necessary to the restoration of Tryon's Palace in New Bern, Craven County, North Carolina, may be acquired by condemnation, as contemplated by Chapter 791, Session Laws of 1945, and Acts amendatory thereof.  Notice of the proceeding was duly served upon the owners of the lands sought to be condemned.  In response to the notice, the landowners, hereinafter called the respondents, filed a special appearance and motion to dismiss the proceeding for that (1) The North Carolina Utilities Commission is without authority to grant the certificate, (2) that the restoration of Tryon's Palace is not a public purpose, (3) that an application was already pending in which the North Carolina Department of Conservation and Development sought to obtain a certificate for identically the same purpose, (4) the pendency of the prior application worked an abatement of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the present application, (5) that the legislative enactments under which the applicants seek the restoration of Tryon's Palace are unconstitutional, (6) that the Governor and Council of State had not approved the application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The State Department of Archives and History filed a petition with the North Carolina Utilities Commission seeking a certificate of public convenience and necessity to acquire by condemnation certain lands necessary for the restoration of Tryon's Palace, a State historical landmark. The property owners filed a motion to dismiss the proceedings contending that the Commission was without authority to grant the certificate, that the restoration of the landmark was not a public purpose, and that an application was already pending in which the Department of Conservation and Development sought to obtain a certificate for identically the same purpose. The court affirmed the superior court's judgment approving the Commission's order granting the certificate. The court concluded that the pendency of the prior application did not work an abatement of the present application. The court found that the property owners had notice of the prior and present petitions, and the court ruled that the Commission could properly substitute the Department of Archives in lieu of the Department of Conservation in the petition. The court held that the restoration of the landmark served a public purpose.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In the case of State </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ernest Roosevelt St. Clair defendant gave bond for his personal appearance at a session of the County Recorder's Court to be held in the courthouse of Cabarrus County on 19 July, 1956, &quot;and answer the above charge and not depart the court without leave&quot; etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The case was tried in Recorder's Court on Thursday, 19 July, 1956.  The defendant pleaded not guilty, but was found guilty, and from judgment entered in Recorder's Court defendant gave notice of appeal in open court, and posted bond in the amount of $ 200.00, and the case was sent up to Superior Court of Cabarrus County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In Superior Court before pleading to the charge contained in the warrant, and before entering upon the trial, defendant appeared in court and through his counsel moved the court to quash the warrant appearing of record for that it was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defective on its face, in that it was signed by one E. R. McKay, Lt., a lieutenant of the Police Force of Concord, North Carolina, purporting to act under the provision of 1945 Session Laws of North Carolina, Chapter 82, &quot;for that said Session law is illegal, unconstitutional and void&quot; in that &quot;said Act is contrary to the provisions of the Constitution of North Carolina, Article II, Section 29, and the provisions of N.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Also in Superior Court the defendant entered a plea of not guilty and was tried at August Term 1956.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">On appeal, defendant claimed the lower appellate court erred in denying his motion to quash the warrant issued against him and in denying his motion for judgment as of nonsuit. The appellate court disagreed. As to the motion to quash, the defect alleged was not fatal and the constitutionality of the act pursuant to which the warrant was issued was not properly raised by defendant. Moreover, the trial court's exercise of its discretion in denying the motion to quash was not reviewable on appeal because the motion was made after defendant entered his plea of not guilty. As to the motion for judgment as of nonsuit, the evidence was sufficient to justify submission of the case to the jury and to support the verdict of guilty. However, because the lower appellate court suspended its judgment on conditions stated, and defendant had not consented thereto, the appellate court struck the judgment and remanded the cause.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petition for a judicial review, under G.S. 143-306&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of a final administrative decision by the State Board of Alcoholic Control suspending the retail beer permit of petitioners for a period of twelve months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioners, as partners, operate the Plaza Grill in Charlotte, a restaurant and &quot;drive-in,&quot; and have a retail beer permit for the premises.  Respondents are the chairman and members of the State Board of Alcoholic Control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 13 April 1956 Earl L. Weathersby, Assistant Director of the Malt Beverage Division of the State Board of Alcoholic Control, wrote petitioners a letter notifying them that the State Board of Alcoholic Control had received a report from one of its inspectors charging them on 24 March and 6 April 1956 with violating the Alcoholic Beverage Control Laws and the regulations promulgated by the State Board by (1) possessing and allowing the possession of whiskey on licensed premises, by (2) allowing the sale and consumption of whiskey on licensed premises, by (3) selling and allowing the sale of beer on licensed premises during illegal hours, by (4) failing to give licensed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  premises proper supervision, and by (5) failing to maintain a suitable outlet for the sale of beer.  This letter notified petitioners of the date, hour and place for them to appear, and show cause, if any they could, why their beer permit should not be revoked, and stated to them they had a right to have counsel and offer evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weathersby conducted the hearing, when and where considerable evidence was offered by the parties.  These are the crucial findings of fact made by Weathersby: Petitioners have six employees, including two curb boys.  About 11:00 p.m. on 24 March 1956 State ABC Investigator, Fred W. Thompson, drove his car on the premises of the Plaza Grill, where there is drive-in curb service.  There he asked John Cureton, a curb boy employee of petitioners, for whiskey.  Cureton said he was out of tax paid whiskey, but had a jar of white whiskey.  Thompson said he would take it.  Cureton went to his car at the rear of petitioners' drive-in lot, and got out of the trunk a half gallon jar of non-tax paid whiskey.  Thompson paid him $ 5.50 for it.  About 11:55 p.m. on 6 April 1956 the same investigator again visited the premises of Plaza Grill, and purchased after closing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  hours from James Robinson, another curb boy employee of the petitioners, a can of beer, which he drank on the premises.  At the same time the investigator made arrangements with John Cureton for the purchase of a case of whiskey.  Upon the findings made by him, Weathersby recommended that petitioners' beer permit be suspended for twelve months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Board of Alcoholic Control rendered a final administrative decision reviewing and approving the findings of fact by Weathersby to the effect that petitioners allowed the sale of beer on licensed premises during illegal hours, allowed the possession and sale of whiskey on licensed premises, and failed to give licensed premises proper supervision.  Whereupon, the State Board suspended petitioners' retail beer permit for twelve months, effective 26 May 1956.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioners filed a petition in the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County praying for a writ of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to bring up for review the decision of respondents, and for a permanent injunction to prevent the suspension of their retail beer permit.  By consent of the parties the proceeding was transferred to the Superior Court of Wake County, and it was stipulated and agreed by the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  parties that the petition filed in the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County should be regarded for all purposes as a petition filed under the terms of G.S. 143-309.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Seawell, after examining and considering the record and the argument of counsel, rendered judgment affirming the findings of fact and decision of the State Board of Alcoholic Control, and ordering that petitioners surrender to the State Board their retail beer permit.  However, the surrender of the beer permit was stayed pending this appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties entered into this stipulation: &quot;That there is no evidence in the record before defendant that petitioners herein had any knowledge of the conduct of their servants, John Cureton or James Robinson, whose activities constitute the basis of the charges filed against petitioners before the Board of Alcoholic Control for the State of North Carolina.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the judgment entered, petitioners appeal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The licensees operated a restaurant and had a retail beer permit for the premises. They did not have a license to sell whiskey. One of the licensees' employees sold a Board inspector whiskey, and another employee sold the inspector beer after closing hours and during a prohibited time. The licensees had no knowledge of the employees' conduct. They were charged with violating the North Carolina Alcoholic Beverage Control Act and the Board's regulations. The Board suspended the licensees' retail beer permit for 12 months, and the lower court affirmed the decision. The court held that the suspension of the permit was an exercise of the State's police power, it was reasonable, it bore a substantial relationship to the public purpose sought to be accomplished by the Act, and it was not in violation of N.C. Const. art I, &sect; 17. The licensees placed the beer in the charge of their employees to sell as a beverage. The employees had no license to sell beer. The licensees elected to operate their retail beer business at least in part with the employees. They were responsible for the employees' conduct in the exercise of their license, whether they know about it or not.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action against the individual members comprising the North Carolina Licensing Board for Tile Contractors and the Executive Secretary of the Board to restrain them from enforcing Chapter 87, Article 3, General Statutes of North Carolina, on the ground that the article is in violation of plaintiff's constitutional rights under Article I, Sections 7 and 31, Constitution of North Carolina, and under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The tile contractor was denied a license to engage in tile contracting after failing the written test administered by the board. The tile contractor alleged that the Act was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and held that the Act was in violation of the N.C. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 7, 17, and 31, therefore the Act was void. The court agreed to hear the arguments regarding the constitutionality of the Act because it appeared that the fundamental right to work and earn a living was affected by the Act. The court stated that the ability to install tile was not necessarily related to the ability to communicate the process of the installation of tile on paper. The court found that the Act was not within the police power granted to the state because it did not promote public health and it did not protect the public from the imposition of fraud. The court noted that certain exceptions to the licensing procedure made it apparent that the public health was not at issue. The court found that the Act gave the board the power to make a monopoly out of the industry because no persons other than licensed contractors were given a voice in the board.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the publisher did not have any contact with the state of North Carolina beyond shipping magazines and newspapers to retail dealers, and an occasional visit by a sales representative. No personal service of process and complaint had been made on the publisher, or any of its officers or agents. The trial court entered judgment quashing the attempted service of summons and complaint upon the publisher, and dismissed the action for want of jurisdiction of the court over the person of publisher. The resident appealed. The court affirmed and held that the publisher has no contacts, ties, or relations with North Carolina, so as to make it amenable to service of process from the courts of the state for the purpose of a judgment in personam against it, and that the trial court had correctly concluded that the publisher has not transacted or done business in the State of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action instituted on 3 February, 1956, to recover $ 13,599.20 commissions.  Summons and complaint were served on the Secretary of State of North Carolina.  The defendant filed &quot;a special appearance and motion to quash the summons and vacate and dismiss the service&quot; for that (1) the defendant is a foreign corporation; (2) that the defendant is not now and never has been engaged in doing business in North Carolina; (3) that the attempted service on the Secretary of State is void under the laws of North Carolina and in violation of the defendant's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In support of its motion, the defendant filed an affidavit in substance: (1) that it is a New York corporation; that it has no officer or other employee in North Carolina authorized to collect money or to transact business; (2) that it has not domesticated and has no property in North Carolina; (3) that it is not doing business in North Carolina; (4) that all sales of its products made in North Carolina were pursuant to orders transmitted to its home office&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in Jamestown, New York, for approval; (5) that all of its products sold in North Carolina were exclusively in interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reply, the plaintiff filed an affidavit in substance (1) that he is a resident of North Carolina and that the contract sued on was to be performed in this State; (2) that the action arose out of the production, manufacture, and distribution of goods with the expectation that they would be, and they actually were used by dealers and merchants in North Carolina, and particularly in the towns of Asheboro, Asheville, North Wilkesboro and Sparta; (3) that at the time suit was instituted and summons and complaint served on the Secretary of State &quot;the defendant was doing business in North Carolina in the following manner: that defendant habitually shipped its goods into North Carolina in its own trucks, which said goods were delivered to its customers by its own agents and employees in charge of said trucks, who also delivered to said customers, along with said shipment of goods, bills of lading covering said shipments and accepted receipts for same and delivered them to the defendant.&quot; The verified complaint alleged that beginning in July, 1954, and including&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  November, 1955, the defendant delivered its goods to Buchan and Lowe at their stores in the above named towns of the total value of $ 647,447.97; and that small deliveries were made to other customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court found (1) that the cause arose out of a contract to be performed in this State and out of the production, manufacture, and distribution of goods with the reasonable expectation that those goods were to be used in said State and they were so used; (2) that at the time this suit was instituted, summons and complaint served, the defendant was doing business in North Carolina; (3) that the defendant has failed to appoint and maintain a process agent in this State.  Upon the findings, the court held that service on the Secretary of State was valid and that the court had acquired jurisdiction over the defendant.  The court ordered the defendant to answer or otherwise plead within 30 days.  To the order, the defendant excepted and from it appealed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The individual alleged that he was owed commissions for certain services rendered to the corporation under contract. The individual testified that the corporation would take orders from customers in North Carolina and deliver goods to the customers in the corporation's own trucks. The individual filed a complaint to recover the commissions allegedly due. The complaint was served on the Secretary of State of North Carolina because the corporation failed to designate an agent upon whom process could be served. The corporation alleged that the service was defective; that the corporation was not doing business in the State of North Carolina; and that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 55-38.1(1)(3) authorizing service on the Secretary of State was unconstitutional. The court held that the corporation was doing business in the State. Specifically, the court held that although the taking of orders in the State to be transmitted to the home office of a foreign corporation for acceptance and the shipment of goods by common carrier would not be doing business in North Carolina under N.C.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiffs from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Mallard, J.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> March Term, 1956, of Durham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The named plaintiffs, residents of six different townships of Durham County, bring this action as such residents and as taxpayers of Durham County, against the Board of County Commissioners and the members of said board, defendants herein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs seek to restrain defendants from exercising any authority purportedly conferred upon them by Chapter 1043, Session Laws of 1949: specifically, (1) to restrain defendants from appropriating and paying tax funds to employees or members of the Durham County Zoning Commission, the Durham County Board of Adjustment, or other employees of Durham County acting under said statute or the zoning ordinance adopted by defendants; (2) to restrain defendants from appropriating and paying tax funds for compiling information, printing or other matters affecting or relating to &quot;any zoning ordinance&quot; adopted by defendants; and (3) to restrain defendants from collecting fees &quot;as alleged in Section 25, paragraph 4, entitled 'General Requirements, the Committee of Durham Zoning Ordinance.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The said statute applies only to Durham County.  Plaintiffs attack said Durham County Act&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as unconstitutional on two grounds, viz.: 1. It is alleged to be a local act in violation of Article II, Sec. 29, Constitution of North Carolina.  2. It is alleged to be a delegation of legislative power in violation of Article VII, Sec. 2, Constitution of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exercising the authority purportedly conferred by said Act, defendants adopted a comprehensive zoning ordinance, applicable to all of Durham County not within the corporate limits of a city or town.  The ordinance defined in detail the permissible uses of property within each of eighteen types or classes of districts.  A map identified the boundaries of various districts and indicated the classification of each.  Certain districts were designated on the map as RD -- &quot;Rural District.&quot; As to land within a Rural District, the ordinance provided that &quot;All realty, and all buildings and structures whatsoever, being or to be used for agricultural, farming, livestock or poultry operations, and all forestry land shall be exempt from each and every provision of this ordinance.&quot; The ordinance definition of &quot;agricultural or farming purposes&quot; is quoted in the judgment of the court below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants appointed a Zoning Commission&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in accordance with the Act.  Upon enactment of the ordinance, defendants appointed a Board of Adjustment as provided in the Act and as provided in the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to attacking the Act as unconstitutional, plaintiffs alleged that the ordinance is invalid for that, in violation of the terms of the Act, it attempts to regulate land in use &quot;for farming or agricultural operations or the keeping of livestock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answering, defendants alleged the validity of the Act and of the ordinance, the appointment of the Zoning Commission, the Board of Adjustment, etc., and admitted they were spending county tax funds to implement and enforce the ordinance and would continue to do so unless restrained.  The court below, on return of a notice to show cause, had before it the pleadings, the Act, the ordinance and the zoning map.  The judgment entered was as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is Considered, Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed that Chapter 1043 of the 1949 Session Laws is constitutional and does not amount to an unlawful and unconstitutional delegation of legislative powers and that the Board of Commissioners of the County of Durham, the defendant herein, has not delegated to the Durham County Board of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Adjustment and Durham County Zoning Commission any authority or power in contradiction of Chapter 1043 of the 1949 Session Laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is further held that the Zoning Ordinances introduced herein are valid and proper ordinances except that portion of Section III of the Zoning Ordinance which is the subject of the controversy in this matter, is void in that part thereof reading:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">'Agricultural or farming purposes shall be realty, buildings or other structures which fall into any one of the following classifications:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">'(a) Any area of realty which is comprised of forty (40) acres or more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c10">'(b) Any area smaller than forty (40) acres which yields an annual gross income of $ 500.00 or more from any agricultural, farming, livestock or poultry operation, exclusive of home gardens.'</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is further found as a fact and adjudged that the Zoning Ordinance and the Boards and Commissioners created thereunder are for a public purpose, and the Board of County Commissioners are authorized to appropriate funds derived from sources other than </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ad valorem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> taxes for the enforcement of said ordinance but they are restrained from expending </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ad valorem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> taxes for the enforcement thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Is Ordered that the costs of this action be taxed against the plaintiff.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers sought to prevent defendants from exercising its rights in adopting a comprehensive zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The taxpayers brought an action against defendants that sought to restrain defendants from exercising the authority conferred upon them by N.C. Sess. Laws 1043 and adopting a comprehensive zoning ordinance. The taxpayers contended that the Act was unconstitutional. The trial court found that the Act was constitutional and that the resulting zoning ordinance was valid, except for its definition of &quot;agricultural and farming purposes. The taxpayers appealed and challenged only the constitutionality of the Act. On appeal, the court vacated the trial court's judgment. The court held that the trial court erred when it understood to rule on the constitutionality of the Act and on the validity of the ordinance because the taxpayers were not directly and personally affected by the constitutionality of the Act. The court noted that the constitutionality of the Act and of the ordinance had to be considered in relation to whether the impact made by the enforcement of the Act or ordinance on the people that challenged the Act and ordinance resulted in an invasion or denial of their specific personal or property rights under the constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court vacated the trial court's judgment and remanded the case with instructions to dismiss the taxpayers' action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action by plaintiff, a citizen, property owner and taxpayer of Anson County, on behalf of himself and all other taxpayers of said county, to enjoin defendant from issuing and selling $ 750,000 of capital outlay school bonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bond order adopted 19 May, 1952, by the Board of Commissioners of Anson County, and approved by a majority of the qualified voters of the county in an election held 28 June, 1952, authorized the issuance of $ 1,250,000 of capital outlay school bonds and the levy of taxes for the payment thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The school plant facilities to be financed by the issuance of said bonds were described in the bond order, in the published notice of election and in the ballot used by the electors, as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(1) erection of a new elementary school building with gymnasium in Wadesboro, and (2) erection of a new high school building with gymnasium at a suitable location in the northwestern section of the county, and (3) remodeling and reconstruction of existing elementary school buildings, and (4) remodeling and reconstruction of the existing building used for the high school in Wadesboro, and (5) erection&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">  of a new building or an addition to an existing building suitable to provide eight rooms for colored children in Wadesboro, and (6) erection of a new building or an addition to an existing building suitable to provide four rooms for colored children in Polkton, and (7) erection of a new building to be used as a teacherage, and (8) acquisition of any land necessary for the erection of such new buildings or additions to existing buildings, and (9) acquisition and installation of the equipment necessary for such new or remodeled or reconstructed buildings or additions to existing buildings.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The county had authorized a bond issue for the school facilities under the N. C. Const. art.

After the bonds were authorized, the United States Supreme Court held that such separate facilities were unconstitutional. The taxpayer argued that the unissued bonds, which were intended for facilities suitable for colored children discriminated against the white race. The court rejected this contention. It found that the portion of the state constitution which required separate facilities was unconstitutional because the United States Constitution took precedence over the state constitution. However, that did not invalidate those parts of the state constitution which were independent or separable. Thus, the mandate that the board of commissions in each county provide the funds for the buildings and equipment necessary for the maintenance and operation of public schools, required under N. C.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warrant was signed by Otley Leary, Chief of Police of the Town of Tarboro, pursuant to the authority contained in Section 4 1/2 of Chapter 13 of the Session Laws of 1953.

The motion was denied and probable cause found and the case sent to the Recorder's Court of Edgecombe County.

The motion was denied and the defendant demanded a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  jury trial, whereupon, the case was transferred to the Superior Court of Edgecombe County as provided in Chapter 482 of the Session Laws of 1951.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the September Term, 1954, of the Superior Court of Edgecombe County, the grand jury returned a true bill against the defendant, charging that on 10 April, 1954, in the County aforesaid, the defendant &quot;did operate a motor vehicle upon the public highway while under the influence of intoxicating beverages or narcotic drugs,&quot; etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record states, &quot;The defendant comes into court and pleads not guilty.&quot; Thereafter, the following appears in the record:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Upon the reading of the warrant the defendant entered a plea of not guilty.  After the plea was entered, the court, in its discretion, permitted the defendant to lodge a motion to quash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After hearing argument of counsel on the motion to quash, the Court ruled:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Court is of the opinion that the motion to quash the warrant is not pertinent to the case for the reason that the defendant has not been put to trial on the warrant, but has been put to trial upon a bill of indictment returned by the grand jury and, therefore, the Court declines to pass upon the constitutionality of the statute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under attack.  The said motion to quash is denied.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and from the judgment pronounced upon the verdict, the defendant appeals to the Supreme Court, assigning error.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;No error.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Edgecombe County Superior Court (North Carolina), which found defendant guilty of unlawfully operating a motor vehicle upon a public highway while under the influence of intoxicating beverages or narcotic drugs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">After a warrant was issued, defendant filed a motion to quash the warrant because it was signed by the police chief, who was not a judicial officer, in violation of N.C. Const. art. 14, &sect; 7. The recorder's court denied the motion, and the case was transferred to the trial court, where the grand jury returned a true bill against defendant. After pleading not guilty to the charge, defendant once again moved to quash the warrant. The trial court held that the motion was not pertinent because defendant had been put to trial upon a bill of indictment returned by the grand jury, not a warrant. On appeal, defendant contended that the warrant signed by the police chief was void and that the trial court erroneously refused to grant his motion for nonsuit. The court held that there was no evidence to refute the finding that defendant was put to trial on the bill of indictment. The court found that the evidence from five witnesses who testified that defendant was under the influence of an intoxicating beverage at the time he was arrested and who had observed defendant's actions as being consistent with one who was intoxicated supported the jury's conclusion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by petitioner from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Fountain, Special Judge,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February Term, 1955, of Durham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City Council of the City of Durham, pursuant to the provisions contained in the acts, referred to hereinafter, and, without a petition, made certain improvements on Liberty Street, from Dillard Street to Hyde Park Avenue, namely: paving, water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, curb, gutter and drainage.  Liberty Street runs in an easterly direction from Church Street to U. S. Highway No. 70.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioner owns property abutting on the north side of Liberty Street in the block between Peachtree Place and Elizabeth Street, and on the south side of Liberty Street between Taylor Street and Elizabeth Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chapter 224 of the Private Laws of 1927 originally applied to only seven cities, but was amended to include Durham by Chapter 425 of the Session Laws of 1947, thereby making the act apply to the City of Durham.  This Private Act is a comprehensive one and authorizes the cities named therein to make local improvements and to assess all or part of the cost thereof against the abutting property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chapter 924 of the Session Laws of 1949 applies only to the City of Durham and is supplemental to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and independent of the powers and authority granted by the General Assembly of North Carolina as contained in the General Statutes and as contained in Chapter 224 of the Private Laws of 1927, as amended by Chapter 425 of the Session Laws of 1947.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City of Durham is authorized under the provisions of Chapter 924 of the Session Laws of 1949 to make local improvements and to assess the entire cost thereof, except such part thereof as is incurred at street intersections, against the abutting property without a petition therefor.  Section 2 of Chapter 924 of the Session Laws of 1949 reads as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When it is proposed to make without petition any improvement or improvements described in Section 1 hereof, the governing body shall adopt a resolution which shall contain substantially the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(a) That this proceeding is taken under and will be governed by the provisions of this Act (stating the number of the Chapter and the Session at which passed by the General Assembly);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(b) A statement of the reasons proposed for the making thereof;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(c) A brief description of the proposed improvement or improvements;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(d) The proportion of the cost of the improvement or improvements&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to be specially assessed and the terms of payment;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(e) A notice of the time and place when and where a public hearing will be held on the proposed improvement or improvements.  (The time fixed for such public hearing shall be such as to allow of notice being given thereof not less than ten days prior thereto);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(f) A notice that all objections to the legality of the making of the proposed improvement or improvements shall be made in writing, signed in person or by attorney, and filed with the clerk of the municipality at or before the time of such hearing, and that any such objections not so made will be waived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The resolution shall be published one time in a newspaper published in the municipality, the date of publication to be not less than ten days prior to the date fixed for the hearing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is conceded by all parties that the various resolutions adopted by the City Council of the City of Durham stated that the proceedings with reference to such improvements were taken pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 924 of the Session Laws of 1949, and those portions of Chapter 224 of the Private Laws of 1927, as amended, which are incorporated into and made a part of Chapter 924 of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Session Laws of 1949.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is stipulated in the record that the various resolutions and notices were actually published in the newspapers as specified by them and as recited therein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no contention that the applicable acts have not been complied with in the proceedings, except the appellant contends and it is admitted by the appellee that the preliminary resolutions calling for the publication of the proposal to make the local improvements, as well as in the final resolutions ordering the improvements to be made, did not contain a statement of the reasons proposed for the making of such improvements, at the time they were published, as provided in Section 2 (b), Chapter 924 of the Session Laws of 1949.  However, it does appear from the record that on 16 November, 1953, the same day the final resolution was passed confirming the assessment roll for the improvements, the City Council of the City of Durham adopted the report of a special committee, appointed to consider objections and protests to the confirmation of the assessment roll, which report, among other things, contained a recommendation to amend, if necessary, the preliminary resolutions, and stated the reasons proposed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for making the improvements as follows: &quot;In order to promote the safety, health, sanitation, comfort, convenience, and welfare of the public of the City of Durham and for the special benefit of abutting properties located on said street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No written objection to the legality of the proposal to make the improvements was filed by any affected property owner, as required by Section 2, subsection (f), of Chapter 924 of the Session Laws of 1949.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioner has interposed no objection to the improvements made, but objected only to the assessment against his property based on the grounds set forth in his appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the final adoption of the assessment roll, after the City Council had found as a fact that each lot abutting upon said improvements, including the lands of the petitioner, has been specially benefited by such improvements in an amount at least equal to the assessment specially assessed against such land, and that the assessments shown on the assessment roll are in proportion to such special benefits, the petitioner gave notice of appeal to the Superior Court.  He petitioned the Honorable Leo Carr, Resident Judge of the Tenth Judicial District (now the Fifteenth Judicial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  District), for a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">writ of certiorari,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> requiring the proper officials of the City of Durham to certify to the Superior Court all resolutions adopted or purported to have been adopted by the City Council of the City of Durham in connection with these local improvements.  The writ was granted and the matter came on for hearing in the court below on three contentions, viz.: (1) that the acts under which the proceedings were conducted are invalid because they are repugnant to Section 29, Article II, of the Constitution; (2) that if the acts are constitutional, respondents failed to comply with the provisions thereof by failing to state in the preliminary resolutions, passed 3 March, 1952, the reasons proposed for making the improvements; and (3) if the acts are valid and it is held that they were substantially complied with, then the assessment on the south side of the street is for twenty feet more frontage than abuts upon the improvement, and an adjustment as to these twenty feet should be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties waived a jury trial and agreed that the trial judge might hear the evidence, find the facts, make his conclusions of law and render judgment thereon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court found the facts&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  accordant with those hereinabove stated and concluded that there had been a substantial compliance with all the statutory requirements in connection with the making of the improvements and the assessments against the respective abutting properties.  Whereupon, judgment was entered confirming the assessments.  The petitioner appeals, assigning error.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Petitioner landowner filed a petition challenging certain resolutions passed by respondent a city relating to proposed street paving, water, sanitary sewer, and storm sewer improvements on a street and purporting to assess the lands abutting the street with the costs of such improvements. A Durham trial court (North Carolina) ruled in favor of the city and upheld the resolutions passed by the city. The landowner appealed from that judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The city, pursuant to the provisions of 1947 N.C. Laws 425 and 1949 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 924, &sect; 2, made certain improvements on a street. The landowner owned property abutting the improved street. The city also found that as a fact that each lot abutting upon the improvements, including the lands of the landowner, had been specially benefitted by such improvements in an amount to at least equal to the assessment specially assessed against such land, and that the assessments shown on the assessment roll were in proportion to such special benefits. The trial court found that there had been a substantial compliance with all the statutory requirements in connection with the making of the improvements and the assessments against the respective abutting properties. The court held that the statutes at issue were not repugnant to N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 29, in that the acts complained of did not come within the purview of that constitutional provision. Further, the city's failure to state in the preliminary resolutions the reasons proposed for making the improvements did not invalidate the proceedings as the city had substantially complied with 1949 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 924, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court modified the judgment of the trial court and affirmed the judgment as modified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Crissman, J.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at 18 April, 1955, Term of Forsyth, as No. 748 at Spring Term, 1955, of this Court, carried over to Fall Term, 1955, as No. 380.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action for declaration of rights, status and relationships of plaintiff under the zoning ordinances of the City of Winston-Salem and a special use permit issued under and pursuant to said ordinances to the &quot;Catholic Diocese of North Carolina&quot; for a private school on and in respect to certain property to which reference is hereinafter made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record on this appeal discloses that after the pleadings were filed plaintiff and defendant agreed upon certain facts, &quot;upon which, together with such additional facts, if any, which the court may find, the rights, status, and other legal relations of the parties to this action are to be determined&quot;: In summary, these are substantially the facts agreed:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. Plaintiff, hereinafter referred to as 'the Sisters' is a non-profit, charitable and religious corporation created and existing under and by virtue of the laws of Pennsylvania,&quot; -- having been &quot;engaged in such charitable and religious functions in Winston-Salem since 1943.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. Defendant, hereinafter referred&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to as 'the City' is now, and was at all the times hereinafter mentioned, a municipal corporation situated in Forsyth County, and created by and existing under certain Private Acts of the General Assembly of North Carolina and other amendatory acts of said General Assembly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The property around which the controversy in this action revolves consists of three platted building lots, 1, 2 and 7, Block 1444, Forsyth County Tax Map, totalling about 3.51 acres.  The buildings thereon consist of an eleven-room main house and a separate building consisting of a greenhouse, servant apartment and 3-car garage.  It is situated in a subdivision originally called &quot;Westview No. 1,&quot; which together with Westview Nos. 2 and 3, and the Country Club Estates, covers an area of some 220 acres.  From time to time many expensive homes have been erected in these developments.  All lots in the named subdivisions were sold subject to certain restrictive covenants, one of which was: &quot;The property shall be used for residential purposes only, and no building other than residences, except garages or outhouses for domestic purposes shall be built on said premises, provided, that this shall not apply to churches and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  schools.&quot; All of the named subdivisions fall within an area zoned as Res. A-1 by the ordinance of the City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;6. On December 21, 1948, the City enacted the present zoning ordinance, which repealed and replaced the former zoning ordinance of the City, adopted about the year 1930 . . . under the provisions of the enabling Act, adopted by the General Assembly of North Carolina, in the year 1947, and under Section 116 of the Charter of the City of Winston-Salem adopted March 3, 1927, and reading as follows: 'The ordinances now in force in the city of Winston-Salem, and such as may hereafter be adopted, shall operate and have effect within one mile outside of the corporate limits of the City . . .'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The zoning ordinance adopted December 21, 1948, by its terms allegedly extended to and included the area lying within the three miles of the corporate limits of the City.  At the time of the enactment of said ordinance,&quot; the property and premises have involved &quot;was a private homesite and dwelling house belonging to the estate of the late B. F. Huntley, which at the time of said enactment, was located approximately 2,300 feet outside the nearest corporate line of the city of Winston-Salem, which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was extended on January 1, 1949, to include the premises.  Pertinent portions of said zoning ordinance set forth in Exhibit B attached to and made a part of the findings . . . provide, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that 'public' schools may be located in all residential zones; that 'private' schools are prohibited from all residential zones except on application for, public hearings on, and grant of, a 'Special Use Permit' by the Zoning Board of Adjustment under the provisions of Section 13 of said Zoning Ordinance.&quot; The zoning ordinance does not define the words &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot; as used with respect to schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;7. The zoning ordinance divides the city into nine (9) zones: four (4) residential and five (5) business, commercial, or industrial . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;8. On December 23, 1948, the Catholic Bishop of Raleigh purchased the premises involved herein for use as a church elementary school.  Application was made by said Bishop for a special use permit under the provisions of Sec. 13, Zoning Ordinance of the City of Winston-Salem.  Several public hearings were had and numerous parties registered opposition.  On February 17, 1949, a Special Use Permit was issued.&quot; Certain conditions were attached to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  said permit.  The permit reads:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is to certify that The Zoning Board of Adjustment has authorized the granting of a Zoning Permit and the same is hereby granted to the Catholic Diocese of North Carolina, for the use of the following described property and the buildings situated thereon for a Private School Subject To The Following Conditions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. Amending the petition to read as follows: 'Existing buildings to be used for a private, day nonboarding school for white children.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. Legal agreements being executed providing that there will be no structural changes on the exterior of the present buildings, except those required by the State and City Building Codes relating to schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. That no additional buildings of any kind will be erected on the land in question.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Description of Property:&quot; Omitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the agreed facts continue:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Catholic Bishop of Raleigh, through counsel, accepted said permit with the conditions set out therein.  None of said conditions apply to public or other non-public schools located in residential zoned areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;9. The premises and existing buildings thereon were used as an elementary school during the period September 1949 through May 1954. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Sisters conducted said school.  Enrollment for the school period 1953-54 was 212 pupils.  In 1954 a new church elementary school was completed on other premises in the same residential zone and adjoining the parish church.  Plans were made to operate a girls high school upon the premises involved here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. . . .&quot; (here the church school presently operated on the premises is described).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;11. The Catholic Bishop of Raleigh made application on July 23, 1954, for changes in the conditions of the Special Use Permit.  Said requested changes are set out in the proposed Special Use Permit presented to the Zoning Board of Adjustment&quot; are these:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is to certify that the Zoning Board of Adjustment has authorized the granting of a Zoning Permit and the same is hereby granted to the Catholic Diocese of North Carolina, or successors in title, for the use of the following described property and the buildings situated thereon for a private school subject to the following conditions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. The following described property and buildings presently existing thereon or which may come into existence thereon shall be used for a private day nonboarding school for white children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. There shall&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be no structural changes to the exterior of, or additions to, the present buildings, except those required by the State and City Building Codes relating to schools, and except for those which shall not be detrimental to the exterior appearance of the present buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. That no additional buildings of any kind shall be erected on the land in question, except after submission of plans for said additional buildings to, and approval thereof by, the Zoning Board of Adjustment under applicable provisions of Sec. 13 (a) of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Winston-Salem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Description of Property:&quot; Omitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreed facts continue:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Procedures required by Section 13 of the Zoning Ordinance were complied with and a public hearing held.  A number of persons indicated opposition.  The Zoning Board of Adjustment on August 9, 1954, voted unanimously against changing the conditions of the outstanding Special Use Permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;12. The Sisters purchased the premises involved here on February 3, 1955.  In connection with the continued use of the premises for school purposes, the Sisters determined that it was necessary and desirable to convert the unused garage at the rear of the premises into&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a classroom.  Conversion requires the removal of three double swinging type wooden doors and replacement thereof by a masonry wall with windows and a door; installation of a new floor and equipment.  Application for a building permit for such work was made on February 5, 1955.  . . . On March 16, 1955,&quot; by letter from Superintendent of Inspections to attorney for the Sisters, building permit was refused, for that, in summary, the zoning permit issued on February 17, 1949, contained the provisions hereinabove set forth; that thereafter on August 9, 1954, the Catholic Diocese, the owner of the property at that time, applied for modification of the foregoing provisions, in manner specified, and that after this request was filed and after it was heard by the Zoning Board of Adjustment it was denied.  The letter concluded with this statement: &quot;In my opinion to grant a permit at this time upon the application dated February 5, 1955, would violate and would be contrary to the provisions contained in the permit issued by the Board of Adjustment on February 17th, 1949.  For this reason, and for the further reason that issuance of a permit on the application dated February 5, 1955, would violate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Winston-Salem, this application is denied.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the agreed facts continue: &quot;Said changes and construction will constitute a structural change to the exterior of the building involved and are not required by the State or City Building Codes relative to schools.  Neither the existing buildings nor the said changes and construction do or would violate any provision of the zoning ordinance as to yard, area, or height.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;13.&quot; (Pertains to the public school system of Winston-Salem.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;14. (a) Defendant City maintains and contends that the Zoning Ordinance, by its terms, prohibits schools of the nature and class as that operated by plaintiff from being located on, or using, as a matter of right or law, premises located within any area of Winston-Salem zoned for residential purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(b) Defendant City maintains and contends that the Zoning Ordinance by its terms, makes the location of, or use of, premises within any area of Winston-Salem zoned for residential purposes, by schools of the nature and class as that operated by plaintiff, a matter of permission, which may be granted or withheld under the provisions of Section 13, of said Zoning Ordinance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;(c) Defendant City maintains and contends that the said Special Use Permit, with conditions attached, as set out in Exhibit C, was validly issued, and is presently in force and effect, including said conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(d) Defendant City maintains and contends that the conditions attached to said Special Use Permit validly prohibits structural changes (except those required by the State and City Building Codes relating to schools) to the exterior of buildings presently located on said premises and validly prohibit any additional changes regardless of size, structure, appearance, or area of premises occupied, from being built on said premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(e) Defendant City intends to enforce the provisions of its Zoning Ordinance and the conditions of the Special Use Permit against plaintiff by taking such action as may be necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;15. When the Sisters purchased the premises involved herein on February 3, 1955, from the Catholic Diocese of North Carolina, they had knowledge of all of the conditions contained in the Zoning Permit dated February 17, 1949, issued by the Zoning Officer of the City of Winston-Salem, same being plaintiff's Exhibit C, and the Sisters also had knowledge at that time&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the Catholic Bishop, acting for and on behalf of the Catholic Diocese of North Carolina, had assented and agreed to all the conditions contained in said Zoning Permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;16. That . . . from time to time over a period of years many expensive homes . . . have been erected in said developments . . . and many of these residences were erected in close proximity to the B. F. Huntley homesite property before it was purchased by the Catholic Bishop of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;17. That numerous property owners, living in close proximity to the property involved in this proceeding, formerly owned by the Estate of the late B. F. Huntley, appeared at the public hearings, conducted by the Zoning Board of Adjustment of the City of Winston-Salem, with respect to the two applications filed by the Catholic Bishop of North Carolina and opposed the granting of the permits applied for, including the permit issued February 17, 1949 . . . At these hearings these property owners contended that the use of the B. F. Huntley Estate property for school purposes would violate the restrictive covenants contained in all the deeds in the Westview Development, and included also in the deeds to the Huntley property, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and that same was contrary to the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Winston-Salem, and that the establishment and operation of a school on said premises would injure the property of home owners in said developments and cause a depreciation in the value of their properties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;18. That the purpose underlying the application for the building permit dated February 5, 1955 and filed by the Sisters with the proper officials of the City of Winston-Salem is to convert the 4-(3) car garage building, situated upon the premises in question and formerly used by the late B. F. Huntley for the storage of his family automobiles, into additional classroom space and thereby to enlarge the classroom facilities located upon the property in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Sisters agree that the conversion of the garage will provide additional classroom space, but insist that the primary purpose of such conversion is that the concrete floor of the garage is more suitable for science room purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This 6th day of February 1955.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In order to avoid confusion, counsel for both plaintiff and defendant agree that the terms 'Bishop'; 'Catholic Bishop of Raleigh'; 'Catholic Diocese of North Carolina'; 'Catholic Diocese'; 'Catholic&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bishop of North Carolina,' and similar terms, as used throughout the record, are synonymous and refer to Vincent S. Waters, Catholic Bishop of the Diocese of Raleigh, North Carolina.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause coming on for hearing, and being heard, &quot;upon the agreed statement of facts, as appears of record, and the parties having waived trial by jury and having agreed that the court might hear and pass upon the questions involved on the basis of agreed statement of facts, and the parties having agreed through counsel in open court that the judgment might be signed out of term and out of the district as of the date the case was argued on April 8, 1955, and the court having considered the agreed statement of facts, the briefs of the parties, and the argument of counsel, and, on the basis thereof, the court, being of opinion that the plaintiff is not entitled to any of the relief sought in this case . . . Ordered, Decreed and Adjudged that the Zoning Permit issued by the Zoning Officer of the City of winston-Salem to the Catholic Diocese of North Carolina, dated February 17, 1949, together with all the conditions thereof, is valid and binding upon the plaintiff in this action and that the application&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for Building Permit filed by the plaintiff in this action under date of February 5, 1955, violates the conditions contained in the Zoning Permit dated February 17, 1949, and the same is contrary thereto and the refusal of the Superintendent of Inspections of the City of winston-Salem to grant to the plaintiff the building permit applied for on February 5, 1955, was proper and is binding upon the plaintiff in this action, and the plaintiff is not entitled to any of the relief sought in this action, and the same is hereby dismissed, and the plaintiff and its surety are taxed with the costs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record also discloses that upon being notified of the decisions of the court, plaintiff, through counsel, filed written motion, supported by affidavit, for a rehearing, on the ground, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the &quot;sole basis for said decision is the assumed fact that the plaintiff and the Catholic Bishop of Raleigh are one and the same legal entity . . . which is not borne out by the facts before the court . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In support of its motion, signed by its attorneys, plaintiff filed an affidavit of Vincent S. Waters, dated 18 April, 1955, in which it is stated:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I, Vincent S.

In this capacity, I formerly owned lots 1-2-7, block 1444, Forsyth County, Tax Map of the City of Winston-Salem, North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On February 3, 1955, by Warranty Deed of January 18, 1955, I conveyed this property to the Sisters of St. Joseph of Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Since the date of said deed I have no legal interest in the described land and under the laws and regulations and discipline of the Catholic Church this property belongs to the Sisters of St. Joseph of Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which is a separate and distinct entity from the Diocese of Raleigh, North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My sole connection with the Sisters of St. Joseph of Chestnut Hill insofar as the land described is concerned is that as Bishop of the Diocese&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Raleigh, I am charged by the Church and Canon Law with the function of a general and religious supervisor in the regulation of their activities and schools in this area.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The Forsyth County trial court (North Carolina) entered judgment for defendant city in an action commenced by plaintiffs, convent sisters (sisters), for declaration of rights, status and relationships of the sisters under zoning ordinances of the city and a special use permit issued under and pursuant to the ordinances to the Catholic Diocese of North Carolina (diocese) for a private school on certain property. The sisters appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The diocese, in the person of the bishop thereof, had purchased certain premises with dwellings thereon in an area zoned residential by the city's zoning ordinance. The bishop applied for a special use permit under a provision of the zoning ordinance in order to operate a church elementary school on the premises. A special use permit was issued upon certain conditions stated. The bishop accepted the permit. The premises and existing buildings thereon were used as an elementary church school conducted by the sisters. The bishop subsequently applied for changes in the conditions of the special use permit in order to operate a high school on the premises. The city voted against changing the conditions of the special use permit. Subsequently, the sisters purchased the premises and applied for a building permit. The building permit was refused. The court affirmed. The court found that the sisters purchased the premises with knowledge of all of the conditions contained in the zoning permit, and with knowledge that the bishop, acting on behalf of the diocese, had assented and agreed to all the conditions contained in the permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment for the city. The court found that the sisters took title to the premises with full knowledge of the provisions of the zoning permit and thus were estopped to challenge the validity of the permit under which they were allowed to conduct a private school.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action to enjoin defendant unions and defendant carrier from entering into any union shop agreement whereby membership in a labor union is made a condition of employment of the named plaintiffs and fellow employees similarly situated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 23 April, 1953, when this action was commenced, a temporary order, restraining the negotiation of such an agreement and the calling of a strike in support of demands therefor, was signed; and this remained in effect until the final hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undisputed facts include the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant carrier is a &quot;carrier&quot; as defined in the Railway Labor Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thirteen (13) defendant unions are standard labor organizations, under the Railway Labor Act.  They are the duly designated, authorized and recognized bargaining representatives of the nonoperating employees of defendant carrier in their respective crafts or classes.  Since 1946, no election for bargaining representatives has been conducted by the National Mediation Board among the employees of any of these crafts nor has any request or demand for such an election or change in certification&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of bargaining representatives been made.  The plaintiffs and defendant carrier fully recognize these unions and in no way challenge their right to negotiate collective bargaining agreements as to &quot;rates of pay, rules, working conditions or any other matters which are not prohibited by law, . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ten (10) named plaintiffs bring this action in their own behalf and on behalf of &quot;their fellow employees of a class whom they represent and who are similarly situated, (who) are either regular members of one or the other of the defendant labor organizations or are eligible for membership therein, and will be covered and bound by the terms of any agreement entered into between the aforesaid defendant labor organizations and the defendant Atlantic Coast Line.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ten (10) named plaintiffs are members of or eligible for membership in five (5) of the thirteen (13) defendant unions, viz.:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hudson is a member of the American Train Dispatchers Association.  Binkley is a member of the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen of America.  Rackley is a member of the Order of Railroad Telegraphers.  DeVane is a member of, and Tilley, Shepard, Chisholm, Darden and Shannon are eligible for membership in, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employees.  Poisson is eligible for membership in the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to Chisholm, the court found that, while eligible to become a member, his position was excepted &quot;from the bulletin and displacement rules of the collective bargaining agreement&quot;; that, on account thereof, he would not be required to join the union by the terms of the proposed union shop agreement; and the court made its conclusion of law that &quot;Chisholm is not a proper party and the action should be dismissed as to him.&quot; As to Poisson, there is the further finding that he &quot;is not employed by the Defendant Carrier, but retains seniority rights in the class represented by the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The named plaintiffs' present rights under employment, on account of seniority or otherwise, are based upon collective bargaining agreements concerning rates of pay, rules, and working conditions, entered into between defendant carrier and defendant unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 5 February, 1951, defendant unions sought to obtain from defendant carrier a union shop agreement within the terms of the Union&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shop Amendment (10 January, 1951) to the Railway Labor Act.  Defendant carrier declined to enter into a union shop agreement.  On 22 April, 1953, at 2:30 p.m., at a conference arranged for further negotiations, defendant unions presented to defendant carrier a proposed union shop agreement identical in substance to that previously made between defendant unions and the Pennsylvania Railroad and other carriers.  Defendant unions, at such conference, made known their determination to continue negotiations until defendant carrier signed a union shop agreement such as that presented, or one embodying substantially the same terms, or until defendant carrier refused to do so; and that, in the event of such refusal, defendant unions would refer, by ballots previously prepared and printed, the question, to strike or not to strike for such union shop agreement, to their respective members.  At the conference on the afternoon of 22 April, 1953, the discussion consisted largely of inquiries by the representative of defendant carrier as to the meaning of various provisions of the proposed union shop agreement.  No agreement having been reached, the conference was recessed until the next day; but&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  further discussion and negotiation were stayed by the restraining order obtained by plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The original complaint, upon which the restraining order was issued, attacked the proposed union shop agreement (1) as being in violation of the North Carolina statute, sometimes called the Right to Work Act, Session Laws of 1947, ch. 328, G.S. 95-78&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and (2) as being contrary to the expressed wishes and interests of a large number of employees of defendant carrier.  No reference was made to the Union Shop Amendment to the Railway Labor Act nor was it alleged that the proposed union shop agreement would deny to any plaintiff any right guaranteed to him by the Constitution of the United States or by any federal statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On or about 7 May, 1953, the defendant unions removed the cause to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina.  Later, in the Superior Court of New Hanover County, an amended complaint, verified 30 September, 1953, was filed, in which plaintiffs alleged that such filing was &quot;prior to the expiration of the period for the defendants to answer the original complaint (the period having been extended by the pendency of the Motion to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Remand in the United States District Court).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their amended complaint, plaintiffs set forth their original allegations; and thereupon new matter, (1) that the efforts of defendants to obtain a union shop agreement constitutes a breach of trust, being contrary to the expressed wishes and interests of a large number of employees, etc., and (2) that &quot;the negotiations referred to constitute a serious threat to their individual property rights and liberties protected and guaranteed by and under the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the State of North Carolina, and the Federal and State laws and statutes.&quot; The only specification of denial of rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States, or by any federal statute, is that the Union Shop Amendment to the Railway Labor Act &quot;is invalid, null and void as being in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States inasmuch as Congress in enacting the said amendment arbitrarily, discriminatorily, unreasonably and capriciously accorded less favorable treatment to nonoperating railroad employees with respect to the rights of individual employees in connection with union shop agreements&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  than is accorded to other employees in occupations affecting commerce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In answering the amended complaint, defendant unions aver that, upon the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">second</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> removal of this cause to the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of North Carolina, following the filing of the amended complaint, the plaintiffs filed in said court a motion to remand, stating in answer to the allegations of the removal petition, &quot;It is denied that the plaintiffs based their claim for relief upon the Constitution and laws of the United States.&quot; Defendant unions further aver that, induced by plaintiffs' disclaimer as to reliance upon rights arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, the District Court was induced to remand the cause, the second time, to the Superior Court of New Hanover County, upon the ground that, &quot;The cause is one arising under the North Carolina statute and the plaintiffs must prevail, if at all, through the effectiveness of such statute.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs filed a reply, but no reference was made to the allegations of defendant unions summarized in the preceding paragraph.  However, the record before us is barren as to evidence, documentary or otherwise, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  stipulations, findings of fact, etc., as to what occurred in the course of the two visits made by this cause to the District Court.  The only data in this record advising us of these events is gleaned from the references in the pleadings as set out above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uncontradicted evidence is to the effect that defendant carrier had 19,026 employees; that prior to the conference arranged for the afternoon of 22 April, 1953, petitions expressing opposition to a union shop agreement were circulated among the employees; and that some 1,580 nonoperating employees signed such petitions.  The total number of nonoperating employees is not shown.  Nor, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">except as stated below,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does the evidence show the number of employees in the respective crafts, the number of union members as compared with the number of nonunion employees in the respective crafts, or the number within each craft who so expressed opposition to a union shop agreement.  It does appear that in April, 1953, there were approximately 77 employees of the defendant carrier who were members of, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">or eligible for membership in,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the American Train Dispatchers Association; and further, that 53 of these employees had expressed opposition&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to a union shop agreement.  How many of the 77 or the 53 were union members is not shown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant carrier admits in substance the allegations of fact set forth in the amended complaint and concurs in plaintiffs' position as to the applicable law; and, since the North Carolina statute upon which plaintiffs rely creates a criminal offense, defendant carrier seeks an adjudication as to whether the making of such a union shop amendment would constitute a criminal act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant unions controvert certain allegations of fact, but contend primarily that a union shop agreement such as that proposed by them to defendant carrier, and their efforts to obtain such agreement, were in all respects legal and proper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union shop agreement proposed by defendant unions complies in all respects with the provisions of the Union Shop Amendment to the Railway Labor Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon waiver of jury trial, the court below, upon testimony and documentary evidence, made and set forth findings of fact and conclusions of law.  Findings of fact, and evidence in support thereof, other than stated above, in so far as deemed relevant to decision, will be discussed in the opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A final decree was entered, making&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;perpetual and permanent&quot; the restraining order of 23 April, 1953, and adjudging that defendants pay the costs.  Defendant unions, in apt time, filed exceptions to certain of the findings of fact, to all of the conclusions of law, and excepted to the final decree or judgment and appealed therefrom; and upon appeal they assign errors.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Reversed.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendants, unions and a railroad carrier, appealed a decision from the Superior Court of New Hanover (North Carolina), sitting in Special November Term, which entered a final decree in favor of plaintiff employees, acting for themselves and other similarly situated employees, and enjoined defendants from entering into any agreement whereby membership in a labor union was made a condition of employment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">At issue was whether a union shop agreement, which complied in all respects with the provisions of the Union Shop Amendments to the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C.S. &sect; 152, Eleventh, was void under the North Carolina Right to Work Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 95-78 et seq. North Carolina had declared as public policy that the right of persons to work could not be denied or abridged on account of membership or nonmembership in a labor union or organization. The act was valid, except to the extent it conflicted with an act of Congress or fell within the orbit of Congressional authority. The Union Shop Amendment expressly permitted, but did not require, closed union shop agreements. However, the union membership requirement was only obligatory under such an agreement provided the union was selected as the bargaining agent and a closed shop was made a subject of collective bargaining. No demand for a redetermination of a bargaining representative had been made since before the federal law was enacted. Since the court would not grant injunctive relief unless irreparable injury was both real and immediate, the injunction had been improvidently granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court reversed the decision and dissolved the restraining order.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal prosecution in which the bill of indictment contains two counts.  The first count charges that the defendant on 23 February, 1955, &quot;did unlawfully and wilfully build or install a septic tank and nitrification or tile bed for said septic tank and did cover the same without first having them inspected and approved by the Pamlico County Health Department, in violation of rules, regulations, of the Pamlico Board of Health duly adopted July 17, 1951,&quot; etc.  The second count charges that the defendant on 23 February, 1955, &quot;did unlawfully, with force and arms, at and in the County aforesaid build or install a septic tank and nitrification or tile bed for said septic tank without first obtaining a permit from the Health Officer or his duly authorized representative, in violation of the aforesaid ordinance,&quot; etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the call of the case for trial, the defendant, through his counsel, moved to quash the bill of indictment and that the case be dismissed for that the same does not charge a crime.</SPAN></P>

In addition to the aforesaid ground for quashing the Bill of Indictment, it is observed by the court that the offense is alleged in the alternative, for that the Bill charges that the defendant did 'build or install a septic tank and nitrification or tile bed for said septic tank' and that the second count also charged the offense in the alternative in that it contains the language, 'build or install a septic tank and nitrification or tile bed for said septic tank.'</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the motion and discharged defendant. On appeal, the court declined to address the constitutional issue because it was not clear whether it was affirmatively addressed by the trial court. The court held that the words, &quot;build&quot; and &quot;install,&quot; were synonymous for purposes of interpreting the ordinance and that defendant was not prejudiced by their use. The court explained that the gist of the offenses charged was the failure of defendant to get a permit to build or install a septic tank and tile bed and his failure to have them inspected or approved by a health department. The court held that that the indictment was not bad for duplicity and that the motion to quash should have been overruled.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action in tort by general contractor to recover for damage to a school building in process of construction, due to the alleged negligence of the defendants, plumbing contractors.  The plaintiff and the defendants were engaged in the building project under separate written contracts with the Board of Education of Mecklenburg County, whereby the plaintiff was to furnish the materials and labor in connection with the general contract work, and the defendants the plumbing materials and labor.  The gravamen of the plaintiff's cause of action as stated in his second amended complaint is that the defendants in performing their plumbing contract did their work in a negligent manner, as a result of which underground water lines broke and so flooded the foundations of the building that large sections of the walls and underpinning erected by the plaintiff caved in, broke off, and had to be rebuilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint incorporates and refers to numerous sections of the plumbing contract between the defendants and the Board of Education, and also alleges that the defendants violated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  various specific sections of the North Carolina Building Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants, before answering or otherwise pleading, moved to strike numerous portions of the complaint.  The portions sought to be stricken relate to the allegations which set forth and refer to the terms and provisions of (1) the construction contract between the defendants and the Board of Education, and (2) the North Carolina Building Code.  The court below allowed the motion in part and overruled it in part.  Several allegations relating to the contract were ordered stricken; whereas those relating to the Building Code were left in the complaint.</SPAN></P>

The plumbers claimed that the trial court should have stricken the entire complaint. The court modified the order of the trial court, and affirmed. It said that because the trial court had stricken several paragraphs in the complaint, but had then referenced sections from the stricken counts, the remainder of those claims had also be stricken. The court also said that the GC had violated the notice pleading requirements because where the duty violated was one imposed by general or public statute, it was sufficient to allege facts which disclosed the duty imposed by statute. The court found that a complaint should not contain collateral, irrelevant, redundant materials, and if it did, it was subject to being stricken. Moreover the court also said that although plumbers were successful in their demand that additional portions of the complaint be stricken, because they failed to allege certain prayers of relief in the court below, that allegation of negligence was not allowed to be presented for the first time in this Court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action to have rules and practice of allotment of daily selling time upon the Lumberton Tobacco Market (1) declared null and void; (2) that defendant Lumberton Tobacco Board of Trade be declared affected with a public trust; (3) that it be required and enjoined to allot to plaintiff a fair and equal portion of the over-all selling time allotted to the Lumberton Market; (4) that it be restrained from counting in said apportionment any warehouse, or warehouse building, not intended to be actively used or presently actively used for the auction sale of leaf tobacco at said market; and (5) for such other and further relief as to the court may seem just and proper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause coming on for hearing, and at the close of evidence the court, being of opinion that there is no issue of fact to be determined by the jury, dismissed the jury; and, having heard the testimony of witnesses for plaintiff and defendant, stipulations of counsel, documentary evidence and admissions in the pleadings, and, having&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  personally viewed the tobacco warehouses involved in this action, by consent of plaintiff and defendant, the court finds therefrom the following facts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(1) The Bright Belt Tobacco Warehouse Association is a voluntary trade association, including in its membership practically all of the warehouses engaged in the auction sale of leaf tobacco in Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia; seventy-four markets, including the Lumberton market, are members of the association.  The Association makes regulations controlling the sales of tobacco at auction on the several markets, that is, it fixes the opening and closing dates of the markets for auction sales of tobacco and determines the number of hours tobacco may be sold per day, the number of days per week, and the number of baskets that may be sold per day, on a given market.  Non-member markets are governed by the same selling regulations as member markets.  The Association was organized in April 1945 and has made regulations governing sales of tobacco, as above stated, since that date.  &quot;The primary reason (for allotment of selling time on tobacco markets) is to keep the flow of tobacco, the total amount of tobacco&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sold, below the amount that the processing plants can redry.  Tobacco is perishable . . . it is highly desirable and necessary that order be maintained in the process of sales.  Sales should stop and start at uniform intervals, in order that growers may know when their tobacco will be sold . . .'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(2) The defendant, Lumberton Tobacco Board of Trade, is a member of the Bright Belt Tobacco Warehouse Association and said Association makes regulations governing the auction sales of tobacco on the Lumberton Market.  The Lumberton Market is known as a 'Three-Set Market,' that is, for a major portion of its selling season it has three sets of buyers, and three separate auction sales can be and are conducted simultaneously on this market.  For the 1953 season, the Association provided five and one-half (5 1/2) hours selling time per day, five days per week, on the Lumberton Market, and allocated the maximum sale of 400 baskets per hour for each set of buyers on this market.  The result was that under the regulations of the Association the Lumberton Market was permitted to sell daily 6,600 baskets of tobacco during the 1953 season.  The same allocation of 6,600 baskets per day was made by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Association to the Lumberton Market each year from and after the organization of the association and the Lumberton Market had observed this selling limitation under prior regulatory agency each year from 1942 to the organization of the Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(3) The defendant, Lumberton Tobacco Board of Trade, is a nonstock corporation, incorporated in 1942 under the provisions of Section 465, Chapter 106, of the General Statutes of North Carolina, and its members are warehousemen and purchasers of leaf tobacco at auction, of the Lumberton market.  The defendant is authorized by statute 'To make reasonable rules and regulations for the economic and efficient handling of the sale of leaf tobacco at auction on the warehouse floors,' of Lumberton, but it is not authorized to make rules and regulations for 'The control of prices' or 'In restraint of trade.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(4) In the preamble to the Constitution and By-Laws of the defendant corporation, is the following: 'That the Lumberton Tobacco Board of Trade, Inc. has been organized and chartered in order that persons, firms and corporations engaged in the tobacco industry of Lumberton may become associated and prescribe such reasonable rules and regulations&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as experience has shown are necessary for the honest, orderly and economic conduct of the said business.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Section VIII of said Constitution and By-Laws is as follows: 'Each member by the application of membership, and the acceptance of same, shall be deemed to have as fully consented and agreed to all of the terms and provisions of the by-laws, rules and regulations, as if he had duly entered into a written contract with the Lumberton Tobacco Board of Trade, embodying the same and containing his and its covenant to keep and perform the same.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(5) That for the selling season of 1942, and for each season thereafter, including 1953, the defendant has by regulation put into effect what is known as the 'Floor Space System' of allotting selling time among the member warehousemen of the Lumberton Market.  The majority of tobacco markets use this system.  Under this system the warehouseman is permitted to sell a certain number of baskets of tobacco per day.  The number of baskets allotted to him, in relation to the total number of baskets allotted to the entire Lumberton Market, is in the same ratio as the number of square feet of floor space in the warehouse or warehouses, owned, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  leased and controlled by him, bears to the total number of square feet of floor space in all of the warehouses on the Lumberton Market.  For example, if he owns, leases and controls ten per cent of the warehouse floor space on the market, he received ten per cent of the total daily basket allotment for the market.  Under this system, if a warehouseman (often a group of persons) owns, leases and controls a number of warehouses, he is permitted to sell his entire allotment in one warehouse, if it is large enough and he so elects; this is known in the trade as 'Transferring Selling Time.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'From a warehouseman's standpoint (this) makes a difference in his overhead; same thing is true of purchasers of tobacco, if they have to go to sixteen warehouses per day as against six warehouses, why naturally (they) have more expense with labor and truck hire; from the grower's standpoint, he pays the bill for the whole operation, the cheaper (the) market process, (the) more he gets for his tobacco . . .'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Under this system a warehouseman may put more baskets on his warehouse floor than is allotted to him for a given day (this excess is known as 'overage').  If another warehouseman, or other warehousemen, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  have for sale less baskets than allotted to them, then the warehouseman with an overage may sell his overage.  This right is rotated, in order, among all the warehousemen, all having an equal chance to sell overage.  The 'Floor Space System' is the prevailing custom in the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(6) In 1942 there was 402,125 square feet of warehouse floor space on the Lumberton Market, in ten warehouses, owned and controlled by five warehousemen (groups); and there were sales in only five warehouses.  A basket of tobacco occupies only twenty square feet.  132,000 square feet of floor space (plus some small addition to prevent crowding and for convenience in handling, loading and unloading) would have been sufficient to sell the entire 6,600 baskets allotted to the Lumberton Market.  Competition among warehousemen for larger percentage of the basket allotment, resulted in the construction of additional warehouses.  In 1946 there were fourteen warehouses, owned or controlled by six warehousemen (groups) with 636,213 square feet of floor space (even though one warehouse was removed from the industry entirely and not considered in the allotments).  In 1947 one warehouse was enlarged, making total&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  floor space of 668,291 square feet on the market.  In 1951 there were eighteen warehouses, owned or controlled by seven warehousemen (groups) with 872,275 square feet of floor space.  In 1953 there were twenty warehouses, owned or controlled by eight warehousemen, with 1,363,628.97 square feet of floor space.  All the while from 1942 to 1953 inclusive, the basket allotment for the Lumberton Market remained the same each year, 6,600, requiring only 132,000 to 200,000 square feet of floor space for actual auction sales.  In 1953 there were regular sales in only eight warehouses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(7) From 1942 to 1953 inclusive, the greater part of the surplus floor space on the Lumberton market was used for storage of green tobacco (tobacco which had been sold but not redried) and redried tobacco in hogsheads.  One warehouse was used for storage of cotton, a part of another for storage of lumber and building supplies, part of another for storage of tractors and automobiles, and parts of others for storage of miscellaneous items.  Tobacco has never been sold at auction in some of the warehouses.  Leases of the warehouses for storage, provide that the lessees will make the warehouses available for auction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sale of tobacco, if required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(8) In the trade as a whole (not just in Lumberton), 'Not more than fifteen per cent to twenty per cent of floor space is needed for actual auction sale of the crop.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Storage of green tobacco and hogshead tobacco is considered in the industry as essential to the efficient and economic handling of flue cured tobacco at auction.  Without the means of adequately taking care of tobacco after it leaves the auction, your whole operation breaks down and it is just as necessary and as important part of the marketing process as the actual auction sale itself.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Here there are two or three redrying plants' in Lumberton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Experience in the industry shows that lack of storage space for green tobacco slows the selling process, causes farmers to keep tobacco on hand longer, resulting in deterioration of tobacco and decrease in its value.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Storage space is important for the Stabilization Corporation, which is the world's largest Farmers Cooperative.  It administers a loan program, ninety per cent parity support guaranteed under Federal legislation to the growers.  If tobacco does not bring a bid above support price, the Stabilization Corporation takes it, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  processes and stores it through the facilities of the industry until it can be resold.  The profit is distributed to the growers.  The Stabilization Corporation is not permitted to own warehouses for storage or redrying plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(9) The defendant, Lumberton Tobacco Board of Trade, Inc., adopted a resolution on April 12, 1951 in part, as follows: '. . . It is expressly provided that the owner or operator of tobacco warehouses in the City of Lumberton shall have the right and privilege to transfer part or all of any selling time allotted to any warehouses, which he may operate to any other warehouses that he may own or operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'This resolution shall become operative and be binding upon the warehousemen operating warehouses in the City of Lumberton beginning with the tobacco selling season of 1951, and continuing each successive year thereafter and including tobacco selling season of 1956.'</SPAN></P>

The Directors further advise that the Lumberton Tobacco Board of Trade be requested by them that Cooperative Warehouse, Inc. and all other warehouses be allotted only that portion of the total sales time, assigned to the Lumberton Market, that will be used in the warehouse, claiming credit for the selling time or floor space for such allotment.'</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the 'Floor Space System,' plaintiff received its pro rata share.  These allotments were approved by the members except the plaintiff.  The representative of the plaintiff at the meeting objected to these allotments and informed the meeting that the plaintiff could not agree until there was a meeting of its directors, further stated he could find nothing in the by-laws as to how allotments were to be made, and was advised that allotments were adopted upon the recommendation of the Sales Committee each year before the market&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  opened.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(13) All of the twenty tobacco warehouses on the Lumberton market are constructed in the way and manner of tobacco warehouses generally, in the industry, and all are fit and suitable for auction sale of leaf tobacco if goods in storage were removed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there follow separate findings of fact, Numbers 14 to 32, both inclusive, in respect to the use to which each warehouse in the various groups listed in paragraph (11) above is devoted, -- including the Cooperative Warehouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the court continued findings of fact as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(33) All of the twenty tobacco warehouses on the Lumberton market are available for auction sales of tobacco.  It would not be economical to have twenty auction sales per day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(34) The plaintiff used approximately 82.5 per cent of the selling time allotted to it during the 1953 season, including overage sales.  At times during the season, it could have sold more than its allotment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(35) The plaintiff constructed a warehouse with more floor space than it needed for auction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sale of tobacco, in fact more than was needed to sell the entire allotment to the Lumberton Market; likewise, the other warehousemen had acquired much more floor space than was actually needed for the auction sale of tobacco.  The only difference between the situation of the plaintiff and the situation of the other members of the defendant corporation is that the plaintiff's facilities are all under one roof.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the foregoing findings of fact, the Court concludes as a matter of law:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(a) That the allotment of selling time in accordance with 'Floor Space System' by the defendant is not and was not for the selling season, 1953, unreasonable, arbitrary or inequitable, but constitutes a reasonable regulation of selling time and a reasonable exercise of the authority conferred on the defendant by statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(b) That the allotment of selling time in accordance with the 'Floor Space System' by the defendant is not and was not for the selling season 1953, a regulation in restraint of trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(c) That the defendant's motion for judgment as of nonsuit at the close of all the evidence should be allowed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The cooperative warehouse contended that it was error for the trial court to hold that the regulation of tobacco by the system set up was not a reasonable exercise of the authority conferred upon the tobacco board by statute,&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 106-465, and that it was a restraint of trade. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the business of operating warehouses for the public marketing of tobacco was one affected with a public interest, and subject to reasonable public relations. The cooperative warehouse was a member of the tobacco board and its articles of association constituted a contract between it and its members. Thus, the cooperative warehouse was deemed to have consented to all reasonable rules and regulations pertaining to the business. Under 1933 N.C. Pub. Law ch. 268, as amended by 1951 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 383, the tobacco board had authority delegated to it by the legislature to make reasonable rules and regulations. As long as the legislation laid down a policy and established a standard, no unconstitutional delegation of legislative power was involved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendants from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Armstrong, Presiding Judge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of the Fourteenth Judicial District, heard 19 August, 1954, in Charlotte, N. C., from Gaston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs seek to restrain defendants from passing ordinance annexing to the City of Gastonia the territory described in Exhibit B of the complaint without first holding an election as required by the provisions of G.S. 160-446.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the verified complaint, treated as an affidavit, Rudisill, J., signed an order restraining the defendants, their agents, attorneys and representatives, until further orders of the court, from proceeding &quot;with the passing of any ordinance annexing the territory described in Exhibit B attached hereto, or any part of same to the corporate territory or to the municipal territory of the City of Gastonia, and that the said defendants are hereby forbidden to do anything further toward the annexing of said territory described in said petition and in Exhibit B attached hereto until further orders of this Court&quot;; and at the time and place designated the cause came on for hearing before Armstrong, J., on return of the order to show cause &quot;why this injunction and restraining order should not be continued to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  hearing of this cause in the Superior Court at term time.&quot; The defendants then filed a &quot;Special Appearance and Motion to Vacate Injunction,&quot; which was denied.  The defendants also filed a demurrer, the ground assigned being that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, which was overruled.  The defendants, in apt time, excepted to each of these rulings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Special Appearance and Motion to Vacate Injunction&quot; is based on a contention that the restraining order was signed before the commencement of action by issuance of summons in accordance with legal requirements; but, in view of the conclusion reached, it is unnecessary to review the facts relevant to this phase of the appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint, in substance, alleges:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The named plaintiffs are residents, qualified voters and property owners in the area of Gaston County just outside the corporate limits of Gastonia described in Exhibit B; and the defendants are the Mayor and members of the City Council of Gastonia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an area adjacent to Gastonia, described in Exhibit A of the complaint, an election was held 2 February, 1954, pursuant to G.S. 160-445&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in which a majority of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  participating qualified voters in the area cast their ballots in opposition to the proposed annexation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Thereafter, in June, 1954, the defendants, acting as the City Council of Gastonia, proposed that the area adjacent to Gastonia described in Exhibit B be annexed, &quot;which substantially includes the territory described in . . . Exhibit A,&quot; and caused notice thereof to be published.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. &quot;Pursuant to the notice,&quot; the City Council held a meeting on 20 July, 1954, at which a petition was filed signed by more than 15% (in fact, by more than 50%) of the qualified voters resident in the area described in Exhibit B requesting a referendum on the question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. No action was taken by the City Council at its meeting on 20 July, 1954, but plaintiffs &quot;are informed and believe that on Tuesday night of August 3, 1954, the said City Council, including the defendants herein named, proposes to meet, and at said meeting proposes to annex the territory described in Exhibit B, attached hereto, without first holding an election as required by the provisions of G.S. 160-446.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. &quot;The annexation of the territory therein proposed is unjust, unreasonable, oppressive, dictatorial and arbitrary, and would&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be for the purpose of unnecessarily subjecting the residents of said proposed area to taxation, not for the extension of the privileges of a City resident to the residents of that area, but solely for the purpose of justifying a bond issue to serve the interests of those residents within the territory of the City of Gastonia as the same now exists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prayer for relief is &quot;that an order issue prohibiting and enjoining the City of Gastonia, and specifically the defendants named herein as members of the City Council of the City of Gastonia, from passing any ordinance whereby the territory described in the attached Exhibit B shall be annexed without first holding an election in said territory as required by the provisions of G.S. 160-446, and for such other and further relief to which the plaintiffs may be entitled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint contains other allegations, diverging somewhat from the central theme, such as general allegations that the defendants, acting as such City Council, have been extravagant and wasteful in their management of the affairs of the municipality, and have failed to advertise for bids as required by G.S. 143-129 in connection with the letting of contracts for the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  installation of sewer lines and for street paving, on which account they find it necessary to issue bonds for additional improvements but are unable to do so except upon augmenting the present valuation of the taxable property by annexing new territory.  Too, there is the incongruous allegation that &quot;the calling of a new election embracing substantially the same territory as that embraced by the proposal set out in Exhibit A attached hereto, so soon, is unreasonable, arbitrary, and is a waste of the taxpayers' money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants appeal from the judgment of the court overruling their demurrer.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Reversed.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendants, the mayor and city council of the City of Gastonia sought review of the decision of the Gaston County District Court, Fourteenth Judicial District (North Carolina), which overruled their demurrer to plaintiff residents' action for an injunction, in which plaintiffs sought to block the annexation of certain territory by the City.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The residents brought an action against the City to prevent the council from adopting an ordinance to permit the annexation of property without conducting an election as required by state law. The trial court denied the City's demurrers to the residents' action. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court noted that the ordinance appeared to be a step toward a violation of state law on the part of the City. However, the court held that the mere passage of the ordinance, if it should take place, would have caused no irreparable injury to the residents. Indeed, the plaintiffs did not so allege, nor did they allege that they had no adequate remedy at law. Failing to allege that the passage of the void ordinance would cause irreparable injury or facts from which such irreparable injury could be implied, was insufficient to entitle the plaintiffs to the injunctive relief sought, even though it was alleged that the present purpose of the City was to pass an ordinance beyond the scope of its legislative powers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a civil action brought in the name of the State of North Carolina, on relation of Wiley H. Taylor, Jr., a citizen and resident of Carteret County, against the defendant Carolina Racing Association, Inc., a private corporation, under the provisions of Ch. 19 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, entitled &quot;Offenses against Public Morals,&quot; to perpetually enjoin, as a nuisance as defined by G.S. 9-1, the defendant's maintenance and use of certain premises, buildings, fixtures and machines, for the purpose of gambling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant was ordered to show cause why such writ of injunction should not issue.  The Town of Morehead City and the Morehead City Racing Commission, upon their separate applications, were made parties defendant and granted leave to file answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the pleadings, affidavits and documents before Judge Williams at the hearing, these facts appear:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to an Act of the General Assembly of North Carolina entitled, &quot;An Act Creating the Morehead City Racing Commission for the Town of Morehead City in the State of North Carolina and Providing for an Election Thereon,&quot; Ch. 540, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Public-Local and Private Laws of 1939, hereinafter called the Morehead City Act, an election was held at which a majority of the qualified voters of the town declared themselves in favor of the Act and of the creation of the Racing Commission provided for therein.  (While it is not expressly stated in the pleadings or affidavits, we assume that the members of the Racing Commission were appointed as provided in the Act.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 15 July, 1947, the Commission adopted a resolution granting to the Racing Association, Inc., hereinafter called defendant, (Section 1) &quot;a franchise, right and privilege for a term of ten (10) years from the date hereof to lease from the Town of Morehead City outside the corporate limits thereof, but within the limits of Carteret County, on property leased by the Town of Morehead City, and to construct, operate and maintain a race course or driving park for trotting, pacing and running races for horses and dogs, and to operate and maintain what is generally known as 'Pari-Mutuel machines or appliances' of the kind generally employed and in general use at racing courses in America; provided, however, that said Pari-Mutuel machines and appliances shall only be maintained&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and operated within the enclosure of said park, driving grounds or race course, and only on days or parts of days when races or racing is being therein conducted.&quot; The annual rental for the grounds (Section 2) is one ($ 1.00) dollar.  The franchise so granted (Section 5) is irrevocable for such ten-year period so long as the defendant complies with the terms thereof and with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the Commission.  It is granted (Section 3) upon terms such that the defendant is required to pay to the Commission &quot;for each day or part of day during which races or racing is conducted a sum equivalent to ten per cent (10%) of the gross receipts derived from all sources or operations connected with or incident to the operation of such races or racing conducted during such day or part of day.&quot; The term &quot;sum equivalent to ten per cent (10%) of the gross receipts derived from all sources or operations&quot; shall mean &quot;(a) ten per cent (10%) of the first monies received by the holder of this franchise, derived from the operations of the Pari-Mutuel machines, after the direct return to the bettors shall have been made; (b) ten per cent (10%) of all admissions to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the enclosure; . . .&quot; The defendant (Section 7) cannot transfer or assign the franchise to any other person, firm, association or corporation without first obtaining the written consent of the Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other provisions of the franchise need not be stated, there being no contention that the defendant has breached any of its terms and conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant acquired a tract of land in Carteret County, located approximately four miles west of the Town of Morehead City, and constructed thereon, at a total cost of approximately $ 300,000.00, a race course intended for and suitable for the racing of dogs, and conducted during the years 1948-1953, both inclusive, on said premises, at stated intervals, dog races, in connection with which it installed and maintained, for the use of persons who chose to patronize them in betting on the races, the &quot;pari-mutuel&quot; system and apparati used in connection therewith of the kind employed and used at recognized race courses in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the years 1948-1953, both inclusive, out of revenues received from the operation of the dog-racing track and the &quot;pari-mutuel&quot; system of betting on the races, the defendant has paid to the Town of Morehead&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  City, through the Commission, the following amounts: 1948 -- $ 26,000.00; 1949 -- $ 26,500.00; 1950 -- $ 33,000.00; 1951 -- $ 18,250.00; 1952 -- $ 28,000.00; 1953 -- $ 38,500.00.  These amounts represent ten per cent (10%) of the gross receipts less the salaries and expenses of the Commission.  The defendant, for the 1953 season, had a payroll of $ 107,887.54, exclusive of salaries to its officers, and paid out in purses, that is, to the owners of dogs participating in the races, the sum of $ 63,389.00, and had total operating expenses of $ 333,823.36.  There being no statement as to the salaries and expenses of the Commission for the 1953 season, it does not appear to what extent the 1953 operations were profitable to the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amounts received by the Town of Morehead City have enabled the municipality, without increasing its tax levy, to purchase new fire-fighting equipment, pave and improve streets, purchase a police radio system and other police equipment, increase the salaries of policemen, make improvements to the municipal hospital, purchase additional equipment for grading streets and the collection and disposal of garbage; and, in short, have been generally advantageous&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to its fiscal position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having acquired a tract of land in Carteret County, outside the corporate limits of Morehead City, the defendant, on or about 15 July, 1947, leased it to said town, which in turn leased it to defendant, each lease being for the term of ten years and each providing that the lessee pay, in advance, a rental of one dollar ($ 1.00) per year.  Under each lease, the defendant was required to pay all taxes and other assessments against the property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants' pleadings and affidavits are to the effect that the operations of the race track and pari-mutuel system have enabled a large number of Carteret County residents as well as others to obtain employment, that they have been conducted in an orderly and proper manner, and that the Town of Morehead City and the adjoining area in and about Carteret County have been greatly benefited thereby.  Further, the defendant alleges that its stockholders, both within and without North Carolina, have invested large sums of money in reliance upon the Morehead City Act and the franchise granted in conformity therewith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the facts disclosed by the defendants' pleadings, affidavits and pleaded documents, the court below&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  held that the operation of the pari-mutuel machines in connection with the dog races constituted the maintenance of an establishment for the purpose of gambling within the purview of G.S. 19-1&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and that Ch. 540, Public-Local Laws of 1939, as amended by Ch. 75, Public-Local Laws of 1941, and Ch. 616, Session Laws of 1949, is unconstitutional.  Thereupon, judgment was entered restraining and enjoining the defendant (Racing Association, Inc.), its servants, agents and employees, from continuing, maintaining and using the premises as a place of business, and restraining and enjoining the removal of furniture, fixtures, etc., therefrom, and ordering the Sheriff of Carteret County to take and retain possession of the premises and of all personal property therein pending the further orders of the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants excepted to the foregoing judgment and appealed to this Court.  The assignments of error, briefly stated, are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. That the court erred in its ruling, and in predicating judgment thereon, that the Morehead City Act is unconstitutional and therefore void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. That the court erred in rendering judgment providing for the seizure of defendant's property and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the restraint of its business, this constituting an impairment of the contract between the Commission and the defendant in violation of Art. I, Sec. 10, of the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. That the court erred in rendering judgment whereby the defendant's investment was made practically worthless, thereby depriving the defendant of its property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. That Ch. 19 of the General Statutes of North Carolina under which judgment was entered, is violative of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States in that it deprives the defendant of its property without due process of law and denies to the defendant the equal protection of the law.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The State of North Carolina sought to enjoin defendant racetrack from the operation of its pari-mutuel machines in connection with dog races as a nuisance within N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 19-1. The trial court, Carteret County (North Carolina), held that the racetrack violated &sect; 19-1, that the ordinance creating the racetrack was unconstitutional, and granted the injunction. The racetrack sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The racetrack claimed that it could not be enjoined under N.C. Gen.

The court rejected this claim and affirmed the lower court's judgment. The court held that where there was a valid criminal statute applicable to the whole state, a local ordinance that purported to exempt persons or trades within its borders from the punishment prescribed by that general law violated N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 and was void. Thus, the court found that the local ordinance that established the racetrack was void because it granted the racetrack a privilege that was directly in conflict with the prohibition against gambling found in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 19-1. The court further held that the racetrack's operations were squarely within the prohibitions of &sect; 19-1 and thus properly enjoined.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action to restrain the defendant municipality from entering into a contract to lease certain property to be used for off-street parking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant city contemplates the establishment of off-street parking facilities to relieve traffic congestion on its streets and provide motorists with adequate and convenient parking space in its business area.  To that end it negotiated the lease or rental of certain property described in the complaint for a term of ten years.  It proposes to expend, over the period of said lease, funds derived from sources other than taxation for the construction and maintenance of said facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs instituted this action to restrain the city from executing said lease agreement or proceeding further with said plan.  They allege in part that off-street parking facilities are not for a public purpose within the meaning of the law; that the proposed plan contemplates the pledge of the full faith and credit of the city, contrary to the provisions of the Constitution; and that the provisions of General Statutes, ch. 160, art. 18, as amended by ch. 171, Session Laws 1953, under&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which the city is proceeding, are unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the cause came on to be heard on the rule to show cause why the temporary restraining order theretofore issued should not be continued to the hearing, the court found certain facts and, upon the facts found, concluded &quot;that the leasing of said lot to establish off-street parking involves an expenditure of public funds for a public purpose within the meaning of the Constitution and the laws of the State of North Carolina, and is reasonably required by the crowded and congested traffic conditions of the City of New Bern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It thereupon entered its order as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wherefore, the Court finds as Conclusions of Law, and Orders, Adjudges and Decrees:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(a) That the restraining order heretofore issued be, and the same hereby is made permanent to the extent and to the effect that defendants are restrained and enjoined from making any appropriation for, or expending any tax money in connection with, the lease of the lot referred to in the complaint or costs of improving, making suitable for, and the maintenance for said off-street parking lot, and that any costs, debt, or obligation made in connection therewith shall not constitute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a general debt or obligation so as to involve the faith and credit of said City, but shall be limited to money and revenues derived from sources other than tax money, unless and until same may be approved by a majority of the qualified voters in said City in an election duly held for such purpose as provided by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(b) That it is Ordered and Adjudged that the defendant, City of New Bern, may proceed to acquire by lease the McCotter lot referred to in the complaint and establish the off-street parking facilities, provided, however, no tax money is appropriated or used for such purpose, and subject to the limitations herein Adjudged, has authority to appropriate annually, from revenues other than those derived from taxes, the annual rental consideration and annual expenses of maintaining and operating said parking lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(c) The Court further finds as conclusion of law and Adjudges that the City of New Bern was and is authorized and empowered to enter into and execute a lease agreement for off-street parking facilities and to appropriate and make expenditures of money from revenue and sources other than tax money, including revenues derived from on-street parking meters, during the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fiscal year 1953-54, subject to the restrictions and limitations herein adjudged, and that the pledging of such revenues will not be in violation of the provisions of Sec. 4, Article 5, or the provisions of Sec. 7 of Article 7 of the Constitution, or in violation of Sec. 160-399 General Statutes of North Carolina, or in violation of any statutes or laws of the State of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Done at Sanford, this 12th day of August 1954, and this judgment is signed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">nunc pro tunc.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiffs appealed from a judgment of the trial court (North Carolina), which allowed defendant City of New Bern to enter into a contract to lease certain property to be used for off-street parking upon their action to restrain the City from doing so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The trial court allowed the City to acquire certain property to be used for off-street parking and plaintiffs appealed. The court modified the order. Conditions in a municipality could be such that the maintenance of off-street parking facilities was for a public purpose in that particular municipality. However, not every municipality could maintain off-street parking facilities as a proprietary public-purpose function. The question depended in each instance upon local conditions as found and declared by the municipality in resolutions duly adopted after notice and an opportunity for local citizens to be heard. The City passed no resolution finding public necessity and convenience, made no appropriation under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160-399(c), adopted no ordinance, designated no nontax fund to be used in furtherance of the proposed plan, or took other action necessary to place it in a position to pursue the alleged undertaking. Therefore, it was necessary to allow the City to take such action as it deemed necessary to support its claim to the right to maintain off-street parking facilities. In the meantime, it was restrained and enjoined from executing the proposed lease agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court modified the order of the trial court by allowing the City to be left free to take such action as it deemed necessary to support its claim and restraining and enjoining it from executing the proposed lease agreement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proceeding under Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner, Mary Mahan, formerly the wife of respondent, Charlie S. Read, filed her petition 20 October, 1953, in the Pulaski County Chancery Court, Arkansas, the &quot;Initiating State,&quot; alleging in substance that Sheilla Treadway Read, age 10, and Dwight LaMont Read, age 6, then residing with her in Little Rock, Pulaski County, Arkansas, are children of petitioner and respondent; that respondent, who resides and is gainfully employed in Rocky Mount, Edgecombe County, North Carolina, owes a duty of support to his said children which he has failed to discharge since 22 July, 1951; and, in accordance with the prayer of the petition, the Chancellor of the Arkansas court, based upon his finding &quot;that the Petition set forth facts from which it may be determined that the respondent owes a duty of support&quot; to his said children, ordered that certified copies of the petition, order, etc., as provided, be transmitted to the Superior Court of Edgecombe County, North Carolina, &quot;responding State,&quot; in order that it &quot;may obtain jurisdiction of the above-named&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  respondent or his property.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon receipt of certified copy of the Arkansas proceeding, a summons and notice were issued by the Clerk in Edgecombe County and served on respondent, who, represented by counsel, filed an answer to the petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hearing was before the Presiding Judge, January Term, 1954, of Edgecombe, without a jury.  Petitioner and respondent were present in person and each testified.  Their testimony was the only evidence before the court.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the court entered judgment, which embodied certain findings of fact and conclusions of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings of fact, summarized, are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondent has not provided support for his minor children since 22 July, 1951.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Until 22 July, 1951, petitioner (wife) and respondent (husband), and their two minor children, resided as a family in Edgecombe County, North Carolina, &quot;at which time the petitioner left the place of abode in Edgecombe County of herself and the respondent and removed herself to the State of Arkansas,&quot; taking with her the two children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In Arkansas, petitioner sued for and obtained an absolute divorce from respondent; and thereafter petitioner married Mahan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Petitioner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was a resident of Arkansas when she filed her petition, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">i.e.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 20 October, 1953, but since 4 January, 1954, she has been a resident of Williamsburg, Virginia, where she is employed as a nurses' aide, the children residing with her there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner's evidence amplifies the findings of fact in several particulars, including the following: She left Rocky Mount for Arkansas 22 July, 1951.  She testified: &quot;I had told him months and months before then that I was going to leave him.&quot; She obtained her absolute divorce in Arkansas 15 November, 1951.  She married an Arkansas boy, presumably Mahan, 28 January, 1952.  She left Arkansas in December, 1953.  She arrived in North Carolina 12 December, 1953.  Presumably she visited in North Carolina -- &quot;all my people are from Rocky Mount&quot; -- until she went to Williamsburg, Virginia.  On 4 January, 1954, she reported for duty as a nurses' aide at the hospital in Williamsburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon its findings of fact, the court below concluded:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That the respondent is legally responsible for the support and maintenance of his two minor children in accordance with his ability, based upon his earning capacity and his estate.  That said responsibility to support&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  said children has already been found to exist by a court of competent jurisdiction of the County of Pulaski in the State of Arkansas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereupon, the court below entered judgment requiring the respondent to pay into the office of the Edgecombe County Welfare Department for the support and maintenance of his two minor children $ 20.00 per week, &quot;and thereafter to continue until the oldest of said children shall reach the age of twenty-one years when the same shall be reduced to the sum of $ 10.00 per week, or until the further orders of this Court,&quot; and providing further that &quot;the Edgecombe County Welfare Department, upon receipt of said sum each week, shall immediately forward said sum so received by it from the respondent to the Clerk of the Chancery Court for the County of Pulaski of the State of Arkansas, who shall transmit the same to the petitioner, in accordance with the statutes in such case made and provided.&quot; Respondent appeals, assigning errors.  </SPAN></P>

The obligor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The obligee filed a petition in Arkansas under the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act alleging that the obligor owed a duty of support to their minor children. The Arkansas court ordered that the petition be transmitted to the trial court. The obligee lived in Arkansas when she filed her petition but later moved to Virginia. The trial court, stating that the Arkansas court found that the obligor had the responsibility to pay support, entered a support order. The court reversed. The court rejected the husband's argument that the Act was unconstitutional, holding that the disposition of the appeal did not necessitate consideration of the constitutionality of the statute. The court found that the Arkansas court did not have jurisdiction to make any determination affecting the substantive rights of the parties and that the Arkansas court did not do so. The court then held that the trial court did not have authority to order the husband to pay support for transmittal to Arkansas, and in turn, for transmittal to Virginia to the wife. The Act should not be interpreted to a situation other than when the obligee was present in the initiating state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Association conducted gambling operations on its premises under a system of pari-mutuel betting on dog races.  It is so alleged in its pleadings and so stated in stipulation set out in the record.  Its contention is that such conduct was lawful because authorized by franchise from the Currituck County Racing Commission granted under the 1949 Currituck Act.  And because of said Act, it contends that G.S. 19-1, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> general statutes providing that premises used for gambling operations constitute a nuisance, are inapplicable.  In the decisions cited above, this Court held adversely to these contentions.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Currituck Superior Court, April 4th Special Term, 1954, defendant Association tendered judgment providing for dismissal of the action and for costs.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assignments of error are to the effect that the failure of the court below to sign the judgment tendered by defendant Association and the judgment as signed and entered constituted a violation of defendant Association's rights under the Constitution of the United States in that the obligations of its contract rights are impaired thereby and in that it is deprived of its property without due process of law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The State brought an action against a dog racing association and a county racing commission.

The lower court denied the motions to dismiss brought by the association and the commission and found in favor of the State. The association and the commission appealed. On appeal, the court found that the 1949 Currituck Act, relied on by the association and the commission, was declared unconstitutional. The court rejected the claim of the association that the obligations of its contractual rights with the commission that granted its franchise were impaired by the judgment of the lower court. The court found that the contract between the association and the commission depended on the unconstitutional Act. The court also rejected the association's claim that it was deprived of property without due process of law by a judgment of the lower court that was a strong departure from the lower court's prior decisions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proceeding under the North Carolina Workmen's Compensation Act, Chapter 97 of General Statutes, upon formal claim dated 21 December, 1950, filed with North Carolina Industrial Commission by Tom Willingham against Bryan Rock &amp; Sand Company, employer, and its insurance carrier, for compensation, G.S. 97-57, for disablement from performing normal labor in the last occupation in which he was remuneratively employed, G.S. 97-54, because of the occupational disease of silicosis, G.S. 97-52 (26) -- to which proceeding the hearing commissioner entered an order on 17 July, 1951, that Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc., of Salisbury, N. C., be made a party, and in which proceeding the claimant employee having died pending appeal of Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc., to the Full Commission, award is made to administratrix of the estate of claimant and to his dependent wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case on appeal reveals these undisputed facts: (1) Tom Willingham was employed by Bryan Rock &amp; Sand Company for fifteen or twenty years at its quarry at Woodleaf, in Rowan County, North Carolina.  He&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was first examined by the Industrial Hygiene Section of the North Carolina State Board of Health in 1937 and at intervals through July of 1950.  He was advised on 4 October, 1950, by letter from Dr. Otto J. Swisher, Jr., Chief, Industrial Hygiene Section, that the Advisory Medical Committee for the North Carolina Industrial Commission had reviewed all the physical examinations and X-rays so given to him by it through those years, and had arrived at a final diagnosis in his case &quot;as that of silicosis in the third stage,&quot; -- and advised him that the Committee did not feel it advisable for him to continue in the dusty trades, and, that, therefore, the usual work card for further employment in any dusty trade or place where there was a dust hazard could not be issued to him.  Copy of this letter was sent to, and received by the Industrial Commission on 10 October, 1950.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) Thereafter on 3 November, 1950, the Industrial Commission received a letter, dated 2 November, 1950, from attorney representing Tom Willingham, requesting that the case be set for hearing.  Whereupon, on 24 November, 1950, the Industrial Commission furnished to the attorney copies of the Commission's Form No. 18, for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his use in reporting the case.  Thereafter on 27 December, 1950, the Commission received completed Form No. 18, -- employee's first notice of accident to his employer, Bryan Rock &amp; Sand Company, dated 21 December, 1950, signed by Willingham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) Thereafter on 9 February, 1951, the Commission received from the Textile Insurance Company, High Point, North Carolina, compensation carrier for the Bryan Rock &amp; Sand Company, an employer's report of claimant's alleged disability on account of silicosis, on which date of last exposure to dust was given as &quot;12/22, 1950, 5 P. M.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) Thereafter on 25 June, 1951, the Industrial Commission sent to all parties then interested, due notice of hearing to be held in Salisbury, North Carolina, at 2 o'clock P. M., on 11 July, 1951, to determine what amount of compensation, if any, claimant was entitled to receive for silicosis.  The case was called for hearing at said time and place, -- present and appearing were attorney for claimant, and adjusters for defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(5) Thereafter on 17 July, 1951, Robert L. Scott, Commissioner, entered an order which, after reciting appearances of attorney for claimant and of attorneys for defendants, reads as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;When this case was called for hearing in Salisbury on 11 July, 1951, counsel for the parties conferred with the Hearing Commissioner and advised him that the claimant had left the employment of the defendant Bryan Rock &amp; Sand Company in January, 1951; that since that time he has been employed during more than thirty working days by Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc., Salisbury; that it is the contention of counsel for both parties that the claimant may have been exposed to the hazards of silicosis within the meaning of the Act during that period, and for this reason counsel for both parties desired that Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc., and its carrier, if any, be made a party to this action.  It is therefore</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ordered that this case be continued at this time, that Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc., Salisbury, be made a party hereto, and that the case be reset upon the next visit of a Hearing Commissioner to Salisbury, due notice going to all parties at that time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(6) The record on this appeal does not show that notice of the above order was served on Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc.  But it does show that thereafter the Industrial Commissioner on 20 December, 1951, sent to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tom Willingham, employee, Bryan Rock &amp; Sand Company, employer, Textile Insurance Company, insurer, and Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc., self-insurer, at their respective addresses, notice of a hearing to be held in the above case at (office of) Clerk Superior Court, Salisbury, N. C., at 9 o'clock A. M., on 9 January, 1952, by order of Commissioner Robert L. Scott to take additional evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(7) Pursuant thereto, the case was heard before Deputy Commissioner W. Scott Buck at time and place shown in preceding paragraph, -- attorney for claimant, attorneys for Bryan Rock &amp; Sand Company and Textile Insurance Company, and attorneys for Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc., appearing.  And the record shows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(a) That defendant Bryan Rock &amp; Sand Company, through its attorney, Mr. Wardlow, stipulated (1) that Tom Willingham was employed by it throughout 1949 and 1950 in North Carolina; (2) that Textile Insurance Company is the carrier for it; (3) that claimant's average weekly wage was $ 43.00; and (4) that the parties were subject to and bound by the terms of the Compensation Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(b) That the Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc., through its attorney, Mr. Hudson, Jr., stipulated that it&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is subject to the Act, and that it is a self-insurer; but that no stipulation is made at that time as to length of time Willingham worked for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And thereupon testimony was taken in respect to the periods during which Tom Willingham was employed by Bryan Rock &amp; Sand Company and by Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc., respectively, and as to the manner and character of his occupational exposure to silica or granite dust during those periods.  And other witnesses including employees and quarry foreman of Salisbury Granite Industries were examined in respect to Willingham's occupational exposure to granite dust while employed by Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc.  (The record shows that no objection was made to the hearing or to the taking of testimony.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter the Deputy Commissioner hearing the case filed opinion, in which it is recited that the parties also stipulated that claimant had been exposed to silica dust in North Carolina for two years in the last ten years, and that he adopts stipulations of parties as findings of fact and conclusions of law, and that &quot;based upon all of the competent evidence&quot; he makes additional findings of fact, in pertinent part substantially as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  set forth hereinabove as uncontroverted facts; and, in respect to Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc., substantially the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Tom Willingham was employed by Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc., from 1 February, 1951, to and through 27 June, 1951, as a flagman and general handy man at its quarry at Salisbury, N. C.; that between these dates he used drills in dry operations for short periods of time each day; that for more than thirty working days, or parts thereof, within seven consecutive calendar months he was injuriously exposed to the hazards of silicosis; that on 27 June, 1951, because of the disease of silicosis he became actually incapacitated from performing normal labor in the last occupation in which he was remuneratively employed; and that Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc., was made a party defendant to this cause by order filed by Commissioner Scott on 17 July, 1951.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the said hearing commissioner also set forth conclusions of law in accordance with the above findings of fact, -- holding, as a matter of law, (1) that the defendant Bryan Rock &amp; Sand Company and its insurance carrier, Textile Insurance Company, must be discharged from liability to the plaintiff&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  claimant, and (2) that &quot;Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc., must be required to pay to the plaintiff claimant benefits prescribed by the Act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And &quot;based upon all of the findings of fact and conclusions of law,&quot; the said Hearing Commissioner entered an award, the pertinent portions of which are these (numbering supplied):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. &quot;The plaintiff's claim for compensation benefits as against Bryan Rock &amp; Sand Company and its insurance carrier, Textile Insurance Company, is in all things denied, and the same dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. &quot;The defendant Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc., shall pay to the plaintiff compensation&quot; as there specifically set forth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant thereto the Commission entered formal award in accordance therewith.  And only the Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc., through its attorneys, in apt time, gave notice of appeal to the Full Commission, and requested review by it in respect to alleged errors on the part of the hearing commissioner:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. For that no claim has been filed against Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc., as required and contemplated by G.S. 97-58 (c).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. For that there was not sufficient evidence presented at the hearing to support the award in that no evidence was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  presented to support a finding that plaintiff was injuriously exposed to the hazards of silicosis while in the employ of Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. For that there was no evidence upon which to base a finding that such exposure as did occur contributed in the slightest degree to plaintiff's disability and the award against this defendant is not justified under G.S. 97-57.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. For that none of the disability claimed by plaintiff arose out of or in the course of his employment by Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. Should G.S. 97-57 be interpreted as imposing liability upon a second employer, where the total disability of the employee was sustained in a former employment, which are the facts in this case, then said section would be unconstitutional, as being in contravention and violation of the due process clauses of the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of North Carolina.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Note: The plaintiff did not appeal.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pending the appeal of Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc., to the Full Commission, it being made to appear that Tom Willingham had died, the Commission entered in this proceeding an order that Mary Willingham, widow of Tom Willingham, as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his sole dependent, and Cottie B. Woodward, Administratrix of the estate of Tom Willingham, deceased, be and they were made parties plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case on appeal discloses that at hearing before the Full Commission on 20 January, 1953, there were present and appearing (1) attorney for plaintiffs, (2) attorneys for defendants Bryan Rock &amp; Sand Company and Textile Insurance Company, and (3) attorneys for defendant Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc., and that (a) &quot;counsel for all parties agreed that Mrs. Mary Willingham was the lawful wife and sole dependent of the deceased Tom Willingham&quot;; (b) that &quot;stipulations entered before and after the hearing before the Full Commission by all parties establish that Tom Willingham died 29 October, 1952, and that his widow is now a proper party to this action as a claimant claiming compensation for his death which is alleged to have resulted from silicosis,&quot; (c) and that &quot;by stipulation entered subsequent to the hearing, it was established that Tom Willingham, the original claimant, died on or about 29 October, 1952, of pulmonary tuberculosis and cardiac failure of which silicosis in the third stage was the cause or contributing cause.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Full Commission concurred in and adopted the findings of fact and conclusion of the Deputy Commissioner against the Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc., on all grounds, -- but amended same to conform to stipulation of the parties of the facts as to death of Tom Willingham, and cause of it, -- and in respect to the widow being his sole dependent, and in respect to the administration upon his estate.  Thereupon the Full Commission set out conclusions of law in the light of facts found, and as against Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc., awarded compensation to the administratrix for the period between 27 June, 1951, and 29 October, 1952, and thereafter to the widow subject to the statutory limitation of $ 6,000.00.  G.S. 97-38, G.S. 97-41.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter in due time Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc., gave to the North Carolina Industrial Commission notice of its appeal to the Superior Court of Rowan County &quot;for errors in findings of fact unsupported by any evidence in the record and for errors of law in the review made by the Full Commission on the 6th day of March, 1953 . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proceeding coming on to be heard at October Term, 1953, of Superior Court of Rowan County, and being heard&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  upon the appeal by defendant Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc., from the award by the North Carolina Industrial Commission, and the presiding judge, being of opinion that the award should be affirmed, entered judgment in accordance therewith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record shows that &quot;To the signing of the foregoing judgment affirming the award by the North Carolina Industrial Commission, defendant Salisbury Granite Industries, Inc., objects and excepts,&quot; and &quot;objects to the entry and rendition of the judgment appearing in the record and excepts thereto and appeals to the Supreme Court,&quot; and assigns error.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">In the Rowan County Superior Court (North Carolina), defendant self-insured employer sought review of an award of death benefits to plaintiffs, an employee's widow and his estate administratrix, by the North Carolina Industrial Commission. The trial court affirmed the Commission's decision. The employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The employee developed silicosis as a result of exposure to granite dust in his employment in a quarry. The employee brought the original claim against his former employer. The Commission made the employer a party to the action. The parties stipulated that the employee was employed by both employers, that the employee died of silicosis, that the widow was entitled to pursue the claim, and that the employer was the employee's final employer. There was no appeal of the Commission's dismissal of the former employer from the action. The Commission held that the employer was solely liable, as the final employer, for the claim. The employer alleged that no claim had been formally filed against it. The court held that the employer's exceptions to the Commission's award were insufficient to invoke judicial intervention. The employer stipulated to the employee's injuries and the widow's right to pursue the employee's claim. Although the employee had silicosis prior to his employment with the employer, the court held that there was sufficient evidence to support a determination that the employee's work with the employer contributed to the employee's occupational disease.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Whitmire, Special J.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Extra February Term 1954 of Mecklenburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action instituted by plaintiff, a resident of, and taxpayer within, the City of Charlotte and County of Mecklenburg, to restrain by permanent injunction the City and County from issuing bonds for the purpose of erecting and equipping public library buildings for the City and County and acquiring such real and personal property as may be useful or necessary for such purposes, and levying and collecting a tax for said bonds in the City for the bonds of the City and a tax in the County, including the City, for the bonds of the County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This civil action was in this Court before, and was remanded because the trial court had not sufficiently complied with the requirement of G.S. 1-185 as to the finding of facts.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Jamison v. Charlotte, ante,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 423, 79 S.E. 2d 797.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After this action was remanded, the plaintiff filed an amendment to his complaint, and the defendants filed an answer to the amendment admitting every allegation therein to be true, except they denied a conclusion of law pleaded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the February Term 1954 the plaintiff and the defendants stipulated that in addition to the facts&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  alleged in the complaint and admitted in the answer, certain additional facts should be made a part of the findings of fact by the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the case came on for trial at the February Term 1954, the plaintiff and defendants did not waive a jury trial, and agree that the Judge could find the facts, make conclusions of law and render judgment, though the parties had done so at the trial at the October Term 1953.  At the February Term 1954 the Judge found as facts all of the allegations in Paragraphs One to Nine, both inclusive, of the Complaint, which allegations were admitted in the defendants' answer, though the judgment does not state these facts, except as above stated, and the Judge further found as facts, and set them forth in the judgment, all the facts stipulated between the parties in the same language used in the stipulation.  The pleadings were introduced in evidence.  The Record shows that the only evidence before the Judge were the pleadings and the stipulations of the parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will clarify the summation of the findings of fact of the Judge essential to a decision of this case by first setting forth a summary of Ch. 1034, Session Laws of North Carolina 1949.  The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Assembly at its 1949 Session enacted Ch. 1034, 1949 Session Laws of North Carolina, which is captioned &quot;An Act to Provide for a Special Election for the Issuance of Bonds by the City of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County to Finance the Building and Equipping of Public Library Buildings.&quot; This Act provided that the Governing Board of the City and County may, by a majority vote of each body, after 30 days notice at the courthouse door and publication in the newspapers, order a special election to determine the will of the people of the City and County as to whether the Governing Body of the City shall issue City Bonds in a sum not less than $ 500,000.00 and not more than $ 1,000,000.00 and to provide for the payment thereof, and as to whether the Board of County Commissioners shall issue the County's Bonds in a like sum, for the purposes set forth in the caption of the Act.  This Act provided that each voter in the City shall be supplied by the election officials with a ballot on which the form of the question shall be in substance &quot;For City and County Library Bonds&quot; and &quot;Against City and County Library Bonds&quot;; and each voter in the County outside the City with a ballot worded&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in substance &quot;For County Library Bonds&quot; and &quot;Against County Library Bonds.&quot; The Act goes on to provide that if a majority of the votes cast in the entire County shall approve the issuance of the bonds, and also if a majority of the votes cast within the City shall approve the issuance of the Bonds, then the Governing Body of the City shall issue and sell Bonds of the City in the amount previously determined, and pledge the faith and credit of the City to the payment of the Bonds, and shall annually levy and collect an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ad valorem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tax to pay the principal and interest on the Bonds, and the Board of County Commissioners shall issue and sell Bonds of the County in a similar manner.  The Board of County Commissioners and the Governing Body of the City shall, acting jointly and upon the voting basis pursuant to the provisions of the law governing the joint meetings of said bodies, have the direction and control of the expenditure of all funds from the sales of said Bonds, and shall approve and make all contracts covering the purchase of property and the erection and equipment of buildings for library purposes, which funds shall be disbursed by their respective treasuries.  The title&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to property acquired shall be vested in such trustees, organizations or corporations, as the said Joint Bodies shall determine in their discretion, and no property now owned or hereafter acquired shall be sold, encumbered, conveyed or otherwise disposed of, except by joint action and approval of the Board of County Commissioners and the Governing Body of the City to be exercised in a joint meeting.  This Act applies only to Charlotte and Mecklenburg County, and shall be in force for ten years after ratification, and only one election shall be held under its authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a synopsis of the Judge's findings of fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The plaintiff is a citizen and resident of the City and County, and owns property therein subject to taxation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. On 12 November 1952 the Governing Body of the City pursuant to Ch. 1034, 1949 Session Laws of North Carolina and the Municipal Finance Act 1921, as amended, adopted an ordinance authorizing $ 800,000.00 Library Bonds of the City, and a resolution calling a special bond election to be held 13 December 1952 for the purposes set forth in Ch. 1034, 1949 Session Laws, and following the procedure therein set forth.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. On 10 November 1952 the Board of County Commissioners of the County acted in a similar manner as the Governing Body of the City for a like sum of county bonds.  Paragraph four of the Complaint is not clear, but it would seem that the voters in the County outside the City were supplied the same form of ballot as the voters in the City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. At the election held on 13 December 1952, 4,447 of the qualified voters within the City cast their ballots &quot;For City and County Library Bonds,&quot; and 1,919 of such voters within the City cast their ballots &quot;Against City and County Library Bonds.&quot; At this election 5,872 of the qualified voters of the entire county voted for said bonds and 2,554 such voters voted against said bonds.  Though it is not set forth in the pleadings, nor found as a fact by the Judge, it would&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  seem that of the qualified voters of the County outside of the City, 1,425 voted for the bonds and 635 against the bonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Governing Body of the City and the Board of County Commissioners on 17 December 1952 caused to be published in newspapers published in and having a general circulation in the City and County, the result of the Library Bond Election, and a notice to the citizens and taxpayers of the City and County to the effect that no right of action or defense founded upon the invalidity of the said election shall be asserted, nor shall the validity of such election be open to question in any court upon any ground whatever, except in an action or proceeding commenced within 30 days after the publication of this statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. On 13 May 1953 the Governing Body of the City adopted a resolution providing for the issuance of $ 800,000.00 Library Bonds of the City authorized at the election held on 13 December 1952 and fixing the form and details of the bonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. On 11 May 1953 the Board of County Commissioners adopted a similar resolution for the issuance of $ 800,000.00 Library Bonds of the County authorized at the same election and fixing the form and details of the bonds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thus far we have stated the facts alleged in the Complaint and admitted in the Answer of the defendants.  The only other facts found by the Judge were the stipulated facts which follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(1) That the proposed bond election was not for the purpose of establishing any new system of libraries for Charlotte and Mecklenburg County, but was for the purpose of extending and enlarging a library system already in existence, which library system is a corporation duly chartered by the Legislature of 1903, and because of an endowment from Andrew Carnegie became known as the Charlotte Carnegie Public Library.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(2) That by act of the Legislature this Library is now 'Public Library of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County' and is governed by a Board of eight Trustees, two of whom are appointed by the Mayor of the City of Charlotte; two are appointed by the Chairman of the Board of County Commissioners of Mecklenburg County, and the other four consist of the Mayor of the City of Charlotte, the Superintendent of the Public School System of the City of Charlotte, the Superintendent of the Public School System of Mecklenburg County, and the Chairman of the Board of County Commissioners of Mecklenburg County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;(3) That at the time of the bond election referred to in this proceeding, this Library corporation operated a system consisting of the main Library in the City of Charlotte and also branches located in the Towns of Matthews, Pineville, Huntersville, Cornelius and Davidson.  Two branches are also operated exclusively for Negroes, one on Brevard Street in the City of Charlotte and another in the community known as Fairview Homes, and it is proposed that these branches be enlarged and expanded and possibly additional branches established, and that the Library also operates two large Bookmobiles on regular bi-weekly schedules with designated stops, both within and outside the City of Charlotte.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(4) That all books and other material dispensed by this Library system are completely interchangeable among all of the above branches and that no distinction is made between the materials available for the Negro branches and that obtainable from the branches for White people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(5) That any resident of Mecklenburg County may obtain the services of this Library system regardless of his place of residence, the main branch inside of the City of Charlotte being regularly patronized by citizens of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mecklenburg County living outside of the City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(6) That this Library system is supported by countywide taxation, a $ 2500.00 annual appropriation made by the City Council of the City of Charlotte, having been approved by a vote of the people of said City; and by a percentage of the net profits from the operation of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Stores throughout Mecklenburg County under special provision in the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(7) That the valuation of property in Mecklenburg County for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ad valorem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> taxes in 1953 was approximately $ 468,482,000, and the valuation of property inside the City of Charlotte was approximately $ 351,354,000, so that property inside the City of Charlotte bears approximately 75% of the County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ad valorem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tax burden; that such relative valuations will probably continue to be substantially the same during the period over which the proposed bonds will be retired.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Judge entered judgment that the judgment entered herein 15 October 1953 including the findings of fact and conclusions of law therein be, and the same are ratified and affirmed in all respects, and the prayer of the plaintiff for injunctive relief is denied.  The judgment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  referred to entered at the Extra Civil Term October 1953 of Mecklenburg so far as material is: &quot;the Court finds as a fact that said Library bonds are for a public purpose, having been duly authorized by a vote of the people in accordance with Chapter 1034 of the North Carolina Session Laws of 1949, and is of the opinion and concludes as a matter of law that said bonds are for a public purpose and that said Chapter 1034 of the North Carolina Session Laws of 1949 is constitutional and does not violate the sections of the Constitution cited by the plaintiff in his complaint, or otherwise, and that the bonds to be issued pursuant to the election held thereunder will be valid obligations of the City of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County, respectively;&quot; and the prayer of the plaintiff for injunctive relief was denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff objected and excepted to each finding of fact, and each conclusion of law and to the judgment, and appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff resident and taxpayer of defendant city and county sought to restrain the city and county from issuing bonds for the purpose of erecting and equipping library buildings and levying a tax for said bonds. The action was in the court, and remanded for the trial court's non-compliance with the requirement of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-185 as to the finding of facts. The resident amended his complaint and defendants admitted every allegation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Resident of, and taxpayer within, the city and county sought to restrain the city and county from issuing bonds for the purpose of erecting and equipping public library buildings and acquiring such property as may have been useful for such purposes, and levying and collecting a tax for said bonds in the city for the bonds of the city and a tax in the county. By virtue 1949 N.C. Sess. Laws 1034, the people of the city who would have been liable for the city bonds, and necessarily affected by the tax to pay them voted for the issuance of these bonds, sanctioning and approving by a majority vote the action of the Legislature. Ultimate sovereignty was vested in the people. The people of the city, by their vote, said an increase in the public library facilities would spread the means of education and promote good government, which would have been to the distinct benefit of the city, which paid the greater part of the taxes in the county. Courts must, wherever possible, uphold the validity of municipal bond elections, unless clear grounds for invalidating them were shown. Therefore, ch. 1034 was constitutional and the proposed bonds were valid obligations of the city and the county.</SPAN></P>
