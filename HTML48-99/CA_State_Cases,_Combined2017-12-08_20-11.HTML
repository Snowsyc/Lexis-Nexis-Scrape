</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff passenger sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California) that sustained a demurrer by defendants, driver and car owner, to plaintiff's second complaint on the ground that an earlier judgment was res judicata and barred the second complaint, even when California's guest statute had been rendered unconstitutional in the interim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff passenger was injured in a car accident in 1969 and filed an action against defendants, car driver and owner, for damages. The trial court granted defendants' motion for non-suit after plaintiff's opening arguments, finding that the evidence would not support recovery under the guest statute,&nbsp;Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 17158. The California Supreme Court later held the guest statute to be unconstitutional, and plaintiff filed a new complaint against defendants under theories of negligence. The trial court sustained defendants' demurrer without leave to amend, finding that plaintiff's claim was barred by res judicata. The court sustained the trial court's order and affirmed the judgment. The court held that plaintiff's second complaint was the same cause of action, even if her theory of recovery had now changed. The court held that the principles of res judicata could not be set aside when the statute relied upon was subsequently held invalid, regardless of the inequity that the ruling might impose. A subsequent change in the law could not be the basis for reviving a dead claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment and order of the trial court that sustained the demurrer on behalf of defendants, driver and car owner, on the basis of res judicata. The court held that plaintiff passenger could not assert a new claim based upon the same cause of action when her first claim had been barred by a valid statute that had since been found to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter arose from respondent Public Utilities Commission's actions on remand in three telephone rate cases. Respondent determined that it lacked legal authority to approve tariffs that would have annually adjusted telephone rates to take account of changing federal tax expenses and, as a result, set a rate that would have created a windfall for the telephone companies to the detriment of the ratepayers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In three telephone rate cases respondent Public Utilities Commission determined, inter alia, that it lacked legal authority to approve tariffs that would annually adjust telephone rates to take account of changing federal tax expenses. As a consequence, respondent found itself compelled to set a rate which would create a windfall for the telephone companies to the detriment of the ratepayers. Respondent took the action in spite of the court's having annulled its previous decisions in the matter for failure to consider lawful alternatives in calculation of federal income tax expense. The court held that because annual adjustment comported both with the governing statutes and the constitution, respondent failed regularly to pursue its authority in failing to consider it, Cal. Pub. Util. Code &sect; 1757. The court remanded the matter, directing respondent to proceed either to take further testimony on the system or to consider its adoption on the basis of the testimony contained in the record of three cases. The court further stated that respondent should weigh its desirability, and set forth the reasons for its ultimate decisions, Cal. Pub. Util. Code &sect; 1705.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that respondent Public Utilities Commission failed regularly to pursue its authority, and therefore the rates could not stand in their entirety. The court affirmed respondent's order except insofar as it depended upon the erroneous treatment of tax expenses, but remanded in order that respondent could reconsider its action with knowledge of the full scope of its powers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, partnership and corporation, entered into a contract to purchase property. Plaintiffs conditioned the sale on the seller's ability to procure commercial zoning for the land. Plaintiffs assumed ownership after defendant city rezoned the property as commercial. Plaintiffs then submitted, and defendant approved, a commercial development plan. Five years later, with the land still undeveloped, defendant rezoned it as agricultural. Plaintiffs sought to sell the property and applied to have it rezoned as commercial in order to procure a higher purchase price. Defendant denied the application and rezoned the property as residential. Plaintiffs filed suit alleging that the rezoning diminished the market value of the property and constituted an inverse condemnation. Respondent trial court sustained defendant's demurrer to the complaint. Plaintiffs petitioned for a writ of mandate to challenge the order. The court denied the petition, holding that an inverse condemnation action could not lie where a zoning action resulted in a mere reduction in the market value of the property. The court also found that defendant was immune from suit under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 818.2.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city clerk informed petitioner candidate that he failed to satisfy residence requirements that required a one-year residence and a six month residence, respectively.

Respondent in her return to the writ informed the court that she had accepted petitioner's papers. The court discharged the writ of mandate and denied the peremptory writ as respondent accepted petitioner's nominating papers and agreed to consider petitioner as a candidate for the subject election. The court found that a 30-day pre-filing residence requirement seemed reasonably necessary and convenient to accommodate the needs of election officials. The court held that any durational residence requirement for candidates for local office in excess of 30 days was violative of the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend IV.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state initiated criminal prosecutions of petitioner union members. Petitioners sought discovery as to whether penal statutes were being discriminately enforced against petitioners. The request for discovery was denied by respondent trial court.

The court issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing respondent to vacate its order denying discovery. The court held that a conscious policy of selective enforcement directed at members of a labor organization was prima facie discriminatory and invalid. The court further stated that criminal defendants were generally entitled to discover all relevant information in the possession of the prosecution that would assist a defendant in the preparation of his defense. Since a defendant could raise intentional discrimination as a ground for dismissal of a prosecution, petitioners were entitled to discovery of information supportive of their claims.</SPAN></P>

The court granted petitioner's request for a writ prohibiting respondent from conducting the hearing before the indictment or information issued because Cal.

The court denied the writ because the relief sought was no longer available but held that the code requirement that an irrevocable choice between the two alternatives had to be made at the time a candidate filed his declaration of candidacy was unconstitutional because it not only unfairly burdened a candidate's exercise of the &quot;in lieu&quot; alternative, but it bore no reasonable relationship to the seriousness of his candidacy or to the cost of administration of the nominating process.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the commitment of a mentally disordered minor who was also a ward of the juvenile court could be accomplished only in accordance with the LPS Act, which required procedures such as a 72-hour evaluation, a 14-day intensive treatment, and judicial certification for 90-day commitment periods.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Real party in interest, fruit company, obtained an ex parte temporary restraining order from respondent Superior Court of Santa Cruz County that barred petitioner union members from mass picketing at real party's property and from trespassing thereon. Petitioners sought a writ of prohibition requiring respondent to refrain from enforcing or continuing in effect the temporary restraining order on grounds that they were not given an opportunity to be heard. The court agreed with petitioners and overruled the order although it had already served its purpose, holding that because the case concerned the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, it was of broad public interest, and that such valuable rights needed protection from unnecessary abridgement. The court held that real party made no effort to inform petitioners of the hearing, and because there was a shortage of legal and factual issues at the hearing because of petitioners' absence, an ex parte restraining order should not have been issued unless a showing was made that it was not reasonably possible to notify petitioners or their counsel and afford them an opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed first holding that appellant's appeal was timely filed when measured against the order which the court found to be the trial court's final judgment. The court also held that the contractual provisions for spousal support at the time of the divorce decree in Virginia were not subject to modification under the prevailing statute as construed by the high court in that state. The court held that at the time the action of this case was commenced, California law would have allowed spouses to enter into particular agreements for their support which could not be judicially modified.

Code &sect; 602 and sought to remove him from his home. A judge denied the minor's application for a de novo rehearing, and the minor appealed. The Supreme Court of California reversed the judge's order. Actual review of and action upon the application by the judge within the time prescribed was necessary to prevent the referee's acts from exceeding the constitutional limitations restricting such acts to subordinate judicial duties and effectuate legislative intent. The court treated the application as a case in which the proceedings were not taken down by an official reporter, so that the application for rehearing was granted as of right, and the expiration of the time for action on the minor's application would cause it to be automatically granted. The order of the court denying a rehearing was appealable as an order after judgment. The instant ruling did not otherwise affect the validity of similar orders made by a juvenile court judge prior to the filing of the opinion of which an application for rehearing was received by the court 45 or more days before the date of filing of the opinion.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner further argued that the 22 years he had served was likewise excessive punishment and that the Adult Authority abused its discretion both in failing to fix a lesser term than the statutory life maximum term and in failing to grant petitioner parole. The court concluded that the penalty provision of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288 was constitutional on its face, but it held that the Adult Authority failed to properly interpret and administer the Indeterminate Sentence Law, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1168. Therefore, the court held that petitioner was entitled to be discharged from his term because he had already served a term that was disproportionate to his offense.</SPAN></P>

Defendants required petitioners to post an undertaking as security for allowable costs under Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 947 and 951. The trial court ordered petitioners to post the undertaking within 20 days or face dismissal. Petitioners sought a writ of mandate to compel respondent trial court to permit prosecution of the action without the undertaking, alleging that it violated due process. The court issued the writ, holding that &sect;&sect; 947 and 951, which were designed to protect public entities against frivolous lawsuits, violated U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV and Cal. Const. art.

Petitioners again sought to dismiss the charges for denial of a speedy trial, but their motion was denied. Petitioners sought a writ of mandate to compel the dismissal of the robbery charges, alleging denial of their constitutional right to a speedy trial. The court denied the petition for a writ of mandate, as petitioners were not denied a speedy trial because they were not prejudiced by the delays that occurred before their arraignment. The court found that no presumption of prejudice existed, as the prosecution was not accountable for any extended delay beyond the 90-day period, and 100 of the 194 days that elapsed after their demands were directly chargeable to petitioners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of annoying or molesting a person under the age of 18, Cal.

In addition, the trial court certified defendant to the superior court for a hearing to determine whether he was a mentally disordered sex offender within the meaning of Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 6300. The superior court conducted a hearing and determined, by a preponderance of the evidence, that defendant was a mentally disordered sex offender and committed him to a psychiatric facility for an indeterminate period. Defendant appealed, arguing that the proper standard of proof in such a proceeding was proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The court reversed, holding that the due process clauses of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7(a) and U.S. Const. amend. XIV required a standard of proof of beyond a reasonable doubt in mentally disordered sex offender proceedings under &sect; 6300. The court determined that the higher standard of proof was required because a finding that a person was a mentally disordered sex offender resulted in significant deprivation of the person's liberty and stigmatization of the person.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the order of the Superior Court of San Mateo County (California), which deemed him a mentally disordered sex offender under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 6300 who would not benefit by care or treatment in a state hospital. The trial court had committed defendant to the department of mental hygiene for an indefinite period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with molesting after he stroked the hair of two young girls. The charge was dismissed when he entered a guilty plea to simple battery. Investigation disclosed that defendant had a history of touching women's hair. As a result, the trial court adjourned the criminal proceedings prior to sentencing and instituted the statutory procedure for determining if defendant was a mentally disordered sex offender under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 6300 et seq. The jury found that defendant was a mentally disordered sex offender who would not benefit by care or treatment in a state hospital. He was then committed for an indefinite period in the department of mental hygiene. Defendant appealed, contending he was illegally committed to an institution in which adequate treatment was not furnished. The court reversed the order committing defendant, finding that it was error for the trial court to confine defendant for an indefinite period as the court had to presume that the term of imprisonment prescribed by the legislature for an underlying crime committed by a mentally disordered sex offender was adequate to protect society against a potential reoccurrence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the trial court was reversed because the statutory scheme, which provided for defendant's confinement as a mentally disordered sex offender, violated the cruel and unusual punishment clauses of both the California and federal constitutions as the state could not involuntarily confine a civilly committed mentally disordered sex offender for an indefinite period in a prison setting.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his sentence following his conviction on charges of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) on the ground that the punishment imposed was cruel or unusual in violation of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 and U.S. Const. amends. VIII and XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant assaulted an elderly man by repeatedly kicking his head and upper body and was convicted of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury. He was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence of six months to life and contended on appeal that his punishment was disproportionate to his offense and, thus, was unconstitutionally cruel or unusual. The court concluded that there could be circumstances, as yet undefined, when imposition of a life-maximum sentence for violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 245(a) would constitute cruel or unusual punishment and held that when a defendant convicted under a section encompassing a wide range of conduct challenges the statute as imposing cruel or unusual punishment, judicial review had to await an initial determination by the Adult Authority of the proper term in the individual case. When the term was fixed, a court could then analyze the constitutionality of the statute as applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury was affirmed on the basis that it was premature to decide whether defendant's prison term would be disproportionate to his offense. Only when a prison term was set, could defendant utilize the remedy of habeas corpus to determine if the penalty was excessive under the facts and circumstances of the crime of which he stood convicted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been drinking with the victim and another individual in celebration of the birth of a child. An argument ensued over the victim's inability to drive defendant home. This argument escalated into a fight, and defendant stabbed the victim several times.

This statement was admitted at trial over defendant's objection. The trial court did not instruct on a lack of motive, and it did not give an accomplice instruction. Defendant was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon, and he appealed. The court adopted the opinion of the trial court and affirmed the conviction. The court did note that defendant's attack on the constitutionality of punishment portion of the statute was premature because the maximum term had not been determined. The court concluded that once the maximum penalty had been assessed defendant could pursue the habeas corpus remedy to assert that the sentence was disproportionate under the facts and circumstances of the crime and violative of the U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State appealed an order of the Superior Court of Marin County (California), which granted petitioner a writ of habeas corpus, contending that the trial court erred in determining that petitioner's conduct did not constitute the crime of kidnapping as prohibited by Cal. Penal Code &sect; 209.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was found guilty on one count of kidnapping for the purpose of robbery and one count of first degree robbery and was sentenced to prison on each count. Thereafter, the court of appeals held that a defendant was entitled to habeas corpus relief if there was no material dispute as to the facts relating to his conviction and if it appeared that the statute under which he was convicted did not prohibit his conduct. The trial court determined that petitioner's conduct did not violate Cal. Penal Code &sect; 209, and state appealed. The court reversed and held that movements to facilitate crimes that were for a substantial distance rather than brief were not incidental thereto and that a movement of 10 to 13 blocks was substantial. Therefore, the movement was not merely incidental to the commission of a robbery even though it may have been solely to facilitate the commission of a robbery because petitioner's asportation of his victim gave rise to dangers not inherent in robbery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with attempted robbery, burglary, and assault with a deadly weapon. When the case was called for trial, the prosecutor announced ready to proceed on all counts and that any plea to the third count was unacceptable. Defendant offered to plead guilty to the third count. The trial court accepted defendant's plea and, at sentencing, dismissed the first two counts in the interests of justice. The court noted that the trial court had no authority to substitute itself as the representative of the state in the plea bargaining process and to agree to a disposition of the case over prosecutorial objection. The dismissal of the first two counts was held to be manifestly invalid because it failed to comply with the statutory requirement that the reasons for the dismissal be set forth. The trial court's action was found to be a &quot;package disposition,&quot; resulting in more lenient treatment of defendant without any showing that it was in furtherance of justice. The court held that the dismissal was not in the furtherance of justice and constituted an abuse of discretion. The order dismissing the counts was reversed and the case remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, city and school district, filed a petition for writ of mandate that sought an order compelling respondent city controller to implement newly enacted measures that provided for salary increases for city employees and teachers employed by petitioner school district.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, city and school district, enacted an ordinance and a resolution that called for salary increases for city employees and certificated school district employees.

Respondent taxpayer filed an action seeking enjoinment of the enactment of the ordinance and the resolution, claiming that the ordinance was enacted by respondent city in response to the strike by city employees. Respondent taxpayer also argued that the resolution regarding salary increases for teachers was violative of the city charter. In response to these actions, respondent city controller refused to implement the ordinance and the resolution. Petitioners sought a writ of mandate, which was granted. The court held that because of separation of powers concerns, it could not sit in judgment of an act of a legislative body, even if the act complained of was in response to an illegal strike. The court further held that the resolution providing for increased teacher salaries was enacted after all board members had conferred regarding the resolution.</SPAN></P>

The court held that even if the salary increase for employees of petitioner city was due to the pressures of an illegal strike, separation of powers concerns precluded the court from sitting in judgment of the acts of a legislative body.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner candidate sought a writ of prohibition to prevent respondent trial court, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), from enforcing a restraining order and injunction it issued on behalf of real-party-in-interest opposing candidate. The orders enjoined petitioner's publication of newsletters concerning real party in interest's bribery prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner candidate published newsletters concerning real-party-in-interest opposing candidate's indictment and trial for bribery charges. Real-party-in-interest brought a libel action and sought an injunction to restrain petitioner from publishing the newsletter, which was granted. After modifications, deemed unsatisfactory by respondent trial court, petitioner brought this action for a writ of prohibition to prevent respondent from enforcing the restraining order and injunction. The court issued the preemptory writ, and held that prior restraints on publications which referred to malfeasance of public officers had long been held violative of U.S. Const. amend. I. Further, the court noted, this was so whether or not the statement was false and misleading. Therefore, since there was no doubt the subject preliminary injunction constituted a prior restraint on petitioner's publishing his newsletter, it could not be sustained because the court believed the contents of the newsletter to be untrue. Consequently, the injunction violated petitioner's rights under the U.S. and California constitutions and had to be annulled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered the preemptory writ to issue restraining respondent trial court from enforcing the restraining order and injunction it issued on behalf of real-party-in-interest opposing candidate because the preliminary injunction was a prior restraint on petitioner candidate's free expression and was, therefore, violative of the U.S. and California constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the minor and respondent county welfare department were not collaterally estopped to deny that appellant was the minor's natural father. The court held that a presumption which precluded appellant in the instant circumstances a right to offer evidence to prove that he was the father of the minor child was unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious, and a denial of due process under U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On petition for rehearing, respondent Superior Court of Santa Barbara County sought review of the determination of the Court of Appeal (California) that superior courts had no authority under any circumstances to review a proposed grand jury report prior to filing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Santa Barbara County Grand Jury had prepared and filed a preliminary report under its &quot;watchdog&quot; authority that sharply criticized the county pathologist for irregularities in financial and other matters in the county hospital's pathology department.

The request was granted. Respondent petitioned for rehearing, and the court reversed the holding of the court of appeal and denied the writ. The court held that although California statutes had established a broad realm in which the grand jury was authorized to investigate and report, the grand jury's domain was not unlimited; if a proposed grand jury report exceeded established legal limits, the superior court that convened the grand jury and was responsible for its supervision could properly refuse to file the report.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff association sought a writ of mandate to respondent Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California), which entered judgment for defendant charter city of San Jose in an action to enjoin enforcement of a zoning ordinance. The court issued an alternative writ of mandate to consider plaintiff's contention that the residents of a charter city could not constitutionally enact a zoning ordinance by initiative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters of defendant charter city of San Jose enacted an initiative ordinance to restrict the zoning of land for residential use for a two-year period pending further study of the impact of residential development. The ordinance prohibited the rezoning of land for residential development within impacted areas of the city unless the school districts in which the land was situated certified that the party seeking rezoning had agreed to provide a satisfactory alternative to permanent school construction. Plaintiff association brought an action in respondent superior court to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance. Respondent entered judgment for defendants, and plaintiff sought a writ of mandate. The court held that the ordinance did not unconstitutionally limit the power of the city council to rezone property, unlawfully delegate zoning authority to the school district, establish unreasonable classifications in violation of the equal protection clause, or interfere with the constitutional right to travel. The court thus denied plaintiff's petition for writ of mandate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court discharged the alternative writ of mandate it had issued, and denied plaintiff association's petition for a writ of mandate to respondent superior court. The court found no constitutional impediment to the enactment of zoning measures by initiative and held that the initiative zoning ordinance enacted by the voters of defendant charter city of San Jose violated no provision of the state or federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city council appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiff building contractor associations in an action claiming that the city charter and the due process clause of the federal constitution precluded defendant from adopting a zoning ordinance without affording notice and hearing to affected property owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city voters enacted an ordinance that established a height limitation for buildings constructed within a prescribed coastal zone, pursuant to an initiative procedure set forth in the city charter. Plaintiff building contractor associations challenged the ordinance as violative of the federal and state due process guarantees, in the absence of notice and hearing. The trial court granted summary judgment to plaintiffs, and defendant city appealed. The court reversed, holding that plaintiffs' due process argument lacked foundation. The city charter authorized the enactment of the challenged ordinance through the initiative process, and the &quot;due process&quot; clause of the federal and state constitutions authorized general zoning legislation without affording affected landowners notice and hearing. Due process &quot;notice and hearing&quot; was mandated only in quasi-judicial or adjudicatory settings, not for the adoption of general legislation, and the city ordinance challenged here was unquestionably a general legislative act, notwithstanding the potential impact on real property values.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to plaintiff building contractor associations in their challenge to a zoning ordinance enacted pursuant to defendant city's charter. Because the ordinance was neither quasi-judicial nor adjudicatory in nature, the due process requirements of &quot;notice and hearing&quot; to affected property owners prior to enactment of the ordinance was not required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent trial court denied petitioner drug defendant's request to be considered for a diversion program under Cal.

Petitioner sought a writ of mandate and challenged that interpretation of the statute, claiming that it unconstitutionally forced him to relinquish his Fourth Amendment rights. The court issued a writ of mandate to compel respondent to refer petitioner for diversion. The court found that the statute only required a prompt waiver of speedy trial and that defendants eligible for diversion could tender usual pretrial motions prior to their expression of consent to consideration for diversion. The court found the legislative purpose to be very liberal with the twofold purpose of sparing appropriately selected first-offenders the stigma of a criminal record and relieving the congested criminal courts of some relatively minor drug abuse prosecutions. The attachment of a condition that a motion to suppress be deferred until after diversion contradicted the intent of the legislature. The constitutional issue was not reached.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff consumer purchased a membership from defendant health club. The price of the membership was $ 408 regardless of whether it was paid in cash or paid in monthly installments. Defendant health club sold the installment contract to defendant finance company and received $ 255 in cash. Defendants had common ownership. Plaintiff brought a class action against defendants alleging violations of Truth in Lending, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1601 et seq., and usury, Cal. Const. art. XX, &sect; 22, violations. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's order that sustained defendants' demurrers. The court held that when a merchant and a finance company maintained an intimate and continuing relationship centering around the routine discounting of installment contracts, both parties acquired an obligation to disclose the amount of the standard discount as a finance charge payable by the consumer even when the consumer was not given the opportunity to pay a lower cash price. The court also held that the trial court erred when it precluded plaintiff from offering evidence to establish that defendants' practice of discounting notes operated to conceal the imposition of usurious interest charges.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 314. Petitioner sought a writ of prohibition to restrain respondent, the Municipal Court for the San Jose-Milpitas Judicial District of Santa Clara County, from conducting a preliminary hearing, contending that indecent exposure was a misdemeanor, regardless of prior convictions. He argued that the provision of &sect; 314 making repeated offenses felonies was invalidated entirely when the indeterminate life-maximum sentence for such offenses was declared unconstitutional. The court denied the writ, holding that only the indeterminate term was invalidated and not the entire recidivist provision. The court ruled that the remainder of the recidivist provision was complete in itself. The court determined that the recidivist provision would have been adopted without the severed portion because the legislature clearly indicated that if any part of &sect; 314 was invalidated, such invalidity should not affect other provisions which could be given effect without the invalid provision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A dispute arose during contract negotiations between defendant city and plaintiff firefighter's union. Defendant agreed to submit some issues to arbitration, but it refused to submit four of the issues, claiming that they involved the &quot;merits, necessity or organization&quot; of the firefighting service and that they were not subject to arbitration, under the exceptions to collective bargaining contained in Vallejo, Cal., City Charter &sect; 809. On writ of mandate, the superior court ordered defendant to proceed to arbitration on those issues and defendant appealed. The appellate court ruled that, because the scope of &sect; 809 paralleled the scope of Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 3504 and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 158(d), state and federal law applied in construing the exception contained in &sect; 809. In modifying the judgment to note a few limited exceptions, and affirming as modified, the court ruled that, under the NLRA and &sect; 3504, issues involving wages, hours, or working conditions, were mandatory subjects of bargaining, including the four disputed issues of hourly schedules, vacancies and promotions for non-supervisory positions, manpower workloads, and reductions in force.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employees sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) which denied their writ of mandate to set aside decisions of respondent California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board that rejected claims for unemployment insurance and disability benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners comprised two categories: those claiming entitlement to disability benefits and those claiming the right to unemployment insurance benefits. All petitioners, members of the boilermakers union, went out on strike. Following a presidential order, the union offered during negotiations to return to work immediately on condition that all employees be reinstated. Since it desired to retain persons hired while the strike was in progress, the company refused to accede, and no agreement was ever reached. The referee granted employment benefits on the ground that the trade dispute ended when the union unconditionally offered to return to work and also granted disability. Respondent state Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board reversed the grant of employment benefits. The court agreed that petitioners were not entitled to employment benefits because they had opportunity to voluntarily return to work, and affirmed the denial. Because respondent did not assume jurisdiction over the disability cases within the 10 days provided for appeal, the referee's decision became final as to the disability benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of unemployment benefits because petitioners alone were responsible for their unemployment and held that the referee's decision concerning disability benefits was not timely appealed and thus became final.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner sought review of that recommendation with the court disputing the merits of the Commission's findings and arguing that the Commission denied him procedural due process, and that any proven misconduct should be mitigated by his inexperience in office or as a justifiable response to an unprofessional effort by the local public defender to prevent him from hearing criminal cases. The court found that the Commission's findings were proper and that the merits of the Commission's findings were supported by evidence. The court found that the petitioner was entitled to some lenience as a result of his inexperience on the bench and his care in making sure that justice was done, advising criminal defendants, and fairness and initiative in sentencing. As a result, the court rejected the recommendation the petitioner be removed and instead found that he should be censured for the misconduct.</SPAN></P>

There was an insufficient community of interest due to the fact that each class member's right to recovery depended upon facts peculiar to his unique parcel of land.

The court declared that the statute establishing the one-year residency requirement, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 198, was unconstitutional. Petitioner sought a writ of mandate compelling respondent to set aside the order. The court found that the residency requirement did not violate due process or the equal protection guarantees of U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Cal. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 11 and 21. The court held that because newcomers were not a cognizable class, the classification was not analogous to those based on race or lineage and was not suspect. Further, the court held that the classification bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest because one of the historic virtues of the jury being selected from the community was its acquaintance with local conditions, customs, and mores.

The possibility that defendant might have declined counsel rather than run the risk of being required to pay counsel fees in an unknown amount under &sect; 987.8 did not deprive her of her right to counsel. The court also held that defendant was not deprived of her right to due process because the proceedings against her comported with due process requirements, and the statute did not expressly sanction the taking of her property without compliance with such requirements.

Code &sect; 11451.6, which established a standard $ 50 per month work-expense allowance for all non-child care related expenses regardless of the recipient's actual employment-related expenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, recipients of aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) whose monthly work-related expenses regularly exceeded $ 50, brought an action challenging a fixed $ 50 standard allowance as incompatible with the provisions of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 602(a)(7) and sought declaratory injunction relief. On appeal, the court held that the preliminary injunction was properly issued. The court found that under &sect; 602(a)(7), in determining a welfare recipient's &quot;nonexempt income&quot; for purposes of calculating an AFDC grant, the state had to take into consideration any expenses reasonably attributable to the earning of any such income. The court held that the inflexible $ 50 standard work-expense allowance established by Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 11451.6 conflicted with &sect; 602(a)(7) insofar as it precluded those recipients whose actual work-related expenses exceeded the $ 50 figure from the benefit of the inclusion of such additional expenses in the computation of their grants.

The court reversed, holding that appellant was properly classified as a probationary instructor and was entitled by statute to pretermination notice and hearing. The court found that appellant worked for more than three months his first year, was hired thereafter for a full year, and was not considered a permanent or substitute teacher. Thus, he met the statutory prerequisites for probationary employment and retained that status over the course of his employment. The court concluded that because respondent provided no hearing, summary judgment for respondent and dismissal of the action were improper.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners, clean air advocates, filed an action for a writ of mandate to challenge respondent's decision to delay the program. The court issued the writ. The court held that respondent had limited authority to delay the NOx program under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 4602(b) for extraordinary and compelling reasons, so long as the action furthered the NOx legislation's primary goal of speedy and effective purification of the atmosphere. However, the court determined that respondent exceeded its authority in voting for a delay on the ground of an energy crisis because energy conservation was not one of the goals of the NOx legislation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that as to games of skill, not chance, the ordinance was unconstitutional. Appellant city sought review. The court affirmed, holding that Los Angeles, Cal., Municipal Code &sect; 43.05.1(B)(1)-(2) violated Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 because the prohibition was inconsistent with state statutes that permitted the use of games of skill. The equal protection clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, was also violated because an arbitrary distinction was created between coin-operated games of skill and other recreational games of skill. The court looked to the legislative intent of the ordinance and found that it did not distinguish between games of chance and of skill because it was enacted before mechanical devices such as flippers were added to the games, thereby introducing the element of skill. The court held that the legislature could not, therefore, have intended to prohibit the use of games of skill.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the act, on its face, contained sufficient assurances that unnecessary intrusions into personal privacy would not occur. The court held that neither the right to privacy, nor the right to seek and hold public office, would inevitably prevail over the right of the public to an honest and impartial government.

Defendant's motion to suppress the evidence was denied by respondent trial court because the people, the real party in interest, successfully argued that the patrolman was a private person. Defendant sought review by writ of mandate. The court granted defendant's writ of mandate because the illegal search and seizure was subject to the exclusionary rule under U.S. Const. amend.

The patrolman acted under the color of authority and did not act to protect the interests of a private employer. The housing authority was a public body corporate and politic and exercised public and governmental functions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff had a checking and charge account at defendant bank. She deposited unemployment and disability payments in the checking account. Without advance notice, the bank deducted that account's balance and applied it to a charge account delinquency. Plaintiff filed suit for an improper banker's lien, claiming that deposits from governmental benefits were exempt from attachment under Cal.  Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 690.18(a). The lower court dismissed the complaint for failure to present facts stating a cause of action; but it did not address whether plaintiff could amend the complaint. Plaintiff appealed, contending that defendant bank had engaged in state action violating due process under state and federal constitutions. The court held that the right of setoff was private action, not state action, and thus not unconstitutional. The court agreed that unemployment and disability payments were exempt from attachment. It concluded that the trial court had erred in dismissing the complaint and provided plaintiff an opportunity to amend, noting that her complaint had erroneously referred to a banker's lien rather than setoff.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner vehicle owners sought a writ of mandamus in the state supreme court and contended that the garageman's labor and materials lien provided for by Cal.

The court granted the writ and noted that principles of procedural due process required the opportunity for a hearing before the state, in aid of a creditor, could deprive a debtor of a significant property interest. The court noted that that the issue was not controlled by whether there was direct governmental involvement because private conduct could become so involved with state action that it was subject to the same due process limitations. The court noted that, unlike the statutorily created garageman's lien, a possessory lienholder had no power of sale under the common law. Furthermore, the sale process was administered, in part, by respondent Department of Motor Vehicles. Thus, enforcement of a lien constituted state action. Moreover, the court noted the lack of the availability of an accelerated hearing process to resolve contested lien claims and concluded that the lien statutes violated petitioners' due process rights.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners unsuccessfully sought to obtain from respondent superior court a writ of prohibition to restrain their prosecutions. Petitioners then sought a writ from the court, which was granted. The court noted that relief could be obtained via a writ of prohibition when a statute or ordinance was alleged to be facially unconstitutional. The court also noted that petitioners had standing to attack the ordinance, even though they made no attempt to comply with it. The court opined that regulations that imposed reasonable restrictions on the time, place, manner, and duration of U.S. Const. amend. I expression were permitted if they narrowly limited the discretion of officials. Procedures that granted officials unbounded discretion in the permit process were prohibited because they could have been used to restrain undesirable speech. The court found that the disputed ordinance contained no discernible standards for the issuance of licenses. Therefore, it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court discharged the alternative writ and denied the peremptory writ of mandate, holding that respondent was correct in ruling that such a veto violated the separation of powers under Cal.

The court reversed and remanded for further proceedings because in denying the writ, the trial court had considered itself bound to apply the substantial evidence standard of review. The court held that plaintiff's right to the pension benefits was a fundamental, vested right, thus, the trial court should have exercised its independent judgment on the evidence to determine if plaintiff's husband's death was service-connected and found an abuse of discretion if the findings were not supported by the weight of the evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After lengthy litigation, including an appeal and a remand, the trial court granted plaintiff osteopaths summary judgment and a peremptory writ of mandate, which ordered defendant licensing boards to examine plaintiffs and to license all who were found qualified. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial court was not in error when it entertained plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment instead of conducting a trial on the merits as ordered by the court of appeals. The court held that, although the trial court had employed the wrong equal protection standard of strict scrutiny, the error did not compel reversal. There was no rational relationship between the protection of the public health and the exclusion from licensure of all medical practitioners who had received their training in an osteopathic rather than an allopathic college and held D.O. rather than M.D. degrees. The Osteopathic Act of 1962, together with the 1962 amendment to the Medical Practice Act in Cal.

Health &sect; Safety Code &sect; 11501, petitioner was sentenced under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11501 without possibility of parole. Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus, contending that the provision of &sect;11501 precluding parole constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The court concluded that the provision was both cruel, in terms of the additional punishment imposed without regard to the character of either the offender or the offense, and unusually excessive, when compared with punishments imposed in California for more serious crimes and with punishments imposed by other jurisdictions upon the same class of offenders. The court, however, held the parole provision severable from the rest of the statute and held that petitioner's sentence as imposed was valid. The court denied the writ and rejected petitioner's other contentions, that his admission of the prior was invalid and that a jury instruction requiring petitioner to show he was entrapped violated due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's case came before the court on automatic appeal from the superior court following his conviction of first degree murder and sentence of death. On appeal, the court affirmed as modified, holding that because the death penalty had been found unconstitutional under Cal. Const. art.

The court held that where defendant failed to move to change venue at the time of trial and raised no issue concerning trial publicity and jury bias on his first appeal, his second appeal, or argument upon recall of the remittitur, the contention was waived. The court held that defendant was not precluded from raising the issue of change of venue at trial or on appeal, where even prior to caselaw breaking new ground in requiring trial judges to take prophylactic measures to prevent publicity from influencing jurors, caselaw made clear that a defendant unable to obtain a fair trial because of prejudicial newspaper publicity had the constitutional right to a change of venue, and there was no evidence defense counsel was unaware of that caselaw or was incompetent.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a judgment of nonsuit in favor of defendants, county and physician, and held that plaintiff's claim was time-barred.

The court held that plaintiff's mother was reasonably diligent in pursuing her suspicion of negligence and that plaintiff's cause of action was timely. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment entered on the verdict in favor of the remaining defendants. The court held that although opposing counsel's conduct constituted misconduct when he presented the jurors with gifts, plaintiff's counsel failed to object and thus waived the argument and that the misconduct was not of such an egregious nature that it could not have been cured by a corrective instruction to the jury.

Thereafter, the Governor of California commuted defendant's sentence to life imprisonment without possibility of parole. Defendant sought habeas corpus relief, which the trial court granted, essentially setting aside the convictions. The state appealed, and the court reversed and remanded. Defendant's statements to the police were voluntary and he was adequately represented by counsel. However, defendant was entitled to relief under the Anderson decision, which held that the death penalty was unconstitutional, and the only valid punishment authorized by Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 190 and 190.1 for first degree murder was life imprisonment.

Examining federal case law and legislative history related to the creation of the military retirement system, the court held that designating the military retirement payments as community property did not unconstitutionally frustrate the congressional intent. The statutory language and structure of the system did not have the purpose of excluding a veteran's ex-spouse. The court also held that the benefits were intended as compensation for past, rather than present, service, and as such appellee was entitled to an interest under the state community property laws to the extent that she was married to appellant while he served.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff was defeated at a subsequent general election; on that same date, he submitted a letter to defendants, a Commission on Judicial Qualifications (commission) and a chief justice of the court, requesting that he be retired pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 75060, on the basis of an alleged disability to discharge the duties of his reason by reason of physical and mental disability; attached to his request were supporting medical affidavits. The request was refused, but the trial court issued a writ of mandate to compel defendants to approve the disability retirement request. On appeal, the court found that substantial evidence had established the principal statutory prerequisite to a disability retirement. Moreover, Cal. Const. art. VI, &sect; 18 disclosed no legislative intent to preclude a disabled judge from obtaining retirement benefits. The court concluded that plaintiff was entitled to a disability pension for the remainder of his life, or until he recovered from his disability; the order below was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the writ of habeas corpus. The court held that petitioner's statement to the trial judge was contemptuous on its face, the trial judge was not required as a matter of due process to refer the matter of adjudication of the alleged contempt to another judge, and because petitioner was not convicted of criminal offense his summary adjudication of contempt was proper under Cal.

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, finding the residency requirement permissible under both state law and the federal constitution. Cal. Const. art.

The court affirmed the dismissal of all of plaintiff's actions except for a request for a writ of mandate to compel the city to issue plaintiff a building permit, the dismissal of which it reversed because plaintiff had stated a cause of action for the writ. The court found that plaintiff failed to state a cause of action against defendant county for declaratory relief, because declaratory relief could not be used to challenge the legislative adoption of the plan, and failed to state a cause of action for inverse condemnation because there was no firm declaration of intent to condemn. The court found that defendant city was not liable under Cal. Gov't.

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the act which provided that residents of inhabited territory were entitled to vote on annexation to a city did not constitutionally require the state to grant a similar right to vote on annexation to residents of a territory that was deemed uninhabited. The court found that the legislative distinction between annexations of inhabited and uninhabited territory did not impinge on the fundamental right to vote because there was not an issue of the exclusion of a class from participation in an election.

It was further alleged by plaintiffs that defendant directors were constitutionally mandated to give such notice in Spanish. The trial court denied plaintiffs' application for a preliminary injunction to prohibit defendants from reducing or terminating their benefits. The court found that because English was the predominate language of the United States and the notice came on official letterhead addressed to each plaintiff with a case number, that the government could reasonably assume they would have sought immediate assistance in getting the notice translated. Plaintiffs' assertion that the due process clause and equal protection principles were violated was found to be without support because the expectation they would seek translation was reasonable and resources providing that assistance were available.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In defendant's prosecution, the trial court entered judgment of conviction of three counts of selling marijuana under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11531. Defendant appealed, contending that the systematic exclusion from the jury of all residents of the district where the crime was committed violated U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV and deprived him of his right to a trial by an impartial jury of the state and district in which the crime was committed. The court reversed the judgment and ruled that the traditional starting point for determining the community from which jurors were to be selected was the scene of the alleged offense and that, in determining whether the source from which a given jury was selected represented a fair cross-section of the community, the court adhered to a notion of community which at least encompassed the location of the alleged offense. It was the community in which the crime was committed that the jury was required to represent. The court held that the district, however large or small, from which the jury was drawn was required to include the area in which the crime was committed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment convicting defendant of selling marijuana. The court ruled that defendant's constitutional right to a trial by a jury required a jury that was selected from a district that included the site of the alleged offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of California consolidated four cases on appeal to determine the constitutionality of certain city and county ordinances which prohibited the service of food or drink and the providing of entertainment by &quot;topless&quot; women and &quot;bottomless&quot; persons of either sex in any establishment.

Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 318.5, 318.6 did not adopt or incorporate the local ordinances. The ordinances regulated conduct within the delineated statutory limits, by proscribing specific behavior by particular persons in designated establishments other than theaters and did not expressly prohibit speech.

Penal Code &sect; 4500 and the death sentence that resulted therefrom. The court set aside the death sentence, but otherwise affirmed the conviction, finding no error in the trial court permitting defendant to represent himself at the guilt stage of the proceedings. The court determined that the trial court, after it initially refused defendant's request for self-representation, permitted the same after concluding that defendant was competent to do so based upon prior prosecutions for the same offense, his knowledge of the rules of evidence, and the retention of the public defender as a consultant to defendant during the proceedings. The court concluded that the trial court's acceptance of defendant's guilty plea did not violate Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1018 because the public defender, who had participated in the trial from its early stages, was reappointed to represent defendant and both defendant and counsel represented to the court that defendant had been fully apprised of the consequences of his plea and thereafter made an informed decision to enter it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought a writ of mandate to compel respondent the Superior Court of Orange County (California) to dismiss a felony information pending against him or a writ of prohibition staying the criminal proceedings. Petitioner contended that he was denied his right to a speedy trial under Cal. Const. art. I &sect; 13 and U.S. Const. amend. VI when, after 228 days, the People, the real party in interest, had not commenced the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was in prison congruent to a guilty plea for a felony. He was issued a writ of habeas corpus that ordered he be rearraigned. Approximately five months later his motion to dismiss was denied. The court found that the right to a speedy trial was a fundamental right secured by U.S. Const. amend. VI and Cal. Const. Art. I, &sect; 13. The court also stated that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1382 provided that, absent a showing of &quot;good cause,&quot; a defendant accused of a felony was entitled to have the charges against him dismissed if he was not brought to trial within 60 days after the filing of criminal charges or after particular events necessitating a retrial thereof. The court further stated that, though &sect; 1382(2) did not apply on its face where a once-convicted person was released from prison on a writ of habeas corpus ordering that he be rearraigned for plea, the self-executing provision of the Constitution required its application. Last, the court stated that the People's reason, that they were unaware of the order to rearraign petitioner, failed to show good cause for the delay and issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing the dismissal of petitioner's charges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the city clerk for the City of Santa Cruz, refused to file petitioner candidate's nomination papers and to place petitioner's name upon the ballot for a municipal election because petitioner did not satisfy the two-year residency requirement contained in Santa Cruz, Cal., Charter &sect; 602. Petitioner candidate sought a writ of mandate to compel respondent to perform those duties. The court issued a peremptory writ directing respondent to file petitioner's papers and to place him on the ballot. The court agreed with petitioner's contention that &sect; 602 violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it was not necessary to achieve a compelling governmental interest. The court conceded that the city had a compelling interest in requiring candidates for elected office to maintain their residence within city limits. The court ruled, however, that the crucial date for such purposes was the date of filing the papers for candidacy. Thus, the court ruled, requiring a candidate to establish residency within the 30-day period preceding an election was permissible, but any period in excess of 30 days was violative of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The city charter provision, which required candidates to have two-years of residency in the city in order to be eligible to run for elected office, was not necessary to achieve a compelling governmental interest. Thus, the provision violated equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment, but held that appellant was not precluded from seeking affirmative relief. Appellant simply failed to seek affirmative relief by means of a cross-complaint.

The court held that the recidivist provision of &sect; 314 was void because the increased punishment provided was far more severe than those of other recidivist statutes penalizing conduct that was more serious and it changed the crime from a misdemeanor to a life-maximum felony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for conspiracy to commit first degree murder and first degree murder of his wife, and was sentenced to death. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that the warrantless tape recordings of the conversations between defendant and state witnesses were not obtained in violation of his rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV because a search warrant for the purpose of secret surveillance was not required where the persons with whom defendant was conversing consented to the recordings of the conversations. The recordings were also not obtained in violation of defendant's rights under U.S. Const. amend. V because defendant was not deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way at the time of the recordings. Further, defendant's statements in the recordings did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VI because the right to counsel did not apply in a pre-indictment setting. The photographs of the victim were properly admitted into evidence because defendant made no objection at trial to the admission of the evidence, and the evidence, although gruesome, was relevant, and any prejudice involved did not amount to grounds for reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant physician performed an abortion in a non-hospital setting and was charged with violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 274. His demurrer to the complaint was sustained by the municipal court, but the superior court reversed and certified the issue. The court held that portions of the 1967 Therapeutic Abortion Act (Act), Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect;&sect; 25952, 25954, 25951(b) and (c), and the first sentence of &sect; 25953, were unconstitutionally vague. The court ruled that it was not possible to tell what degree of impairment must result from a continuance of pregnancy in order to &quot;gravely impair&quot; a prospective abortee's health, and the statute did not adequately define what impairment of &quot;mental health&quot; would justify abortion. Thus, the language establishing the medical criteria upon which abortions could be approved was not sufficiently certain to meet minimal standards of due process. The court found no constitutional impediments to those portions of the Act that required abortions to be performed by licensed physicians in accredited hospitals, or that limited the performance of abortions to the first 20 weeks of pregnancy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the municipal court sustaining the demurrer of defendant physician because the statute prescribing the rules for legal abortions was unconstitutionally void for vagueness in that it failed to give adequate notice of what degree of impairment to a woman's health was necessary to justify an abortion.</SPAN></P>

The court applied strict scrutiny as voting was a fundamental interest and the opportunity &sect; 34311 provided to bar an election was held a burden on the right to vote. The court rejected respondent's argument that the compelling interest in protecting property owners justified the statutory scheme and noted that issues argued as justifications regarding property owners, such as zoning and taxes, also affected non-property owners such that the statute bore no rational relation to a state interest.

The trial court granted the motions, dismissed the charges as to one defendant, and set aside the information as to the second defendant. The People appealed, claiming that the search by an airline employee, who was not acting as an agent of the police, was legal. In agreement, the court reversed the trial court's order, holding that chattel consigned to a common carrier for shipment could lawfully be searched based upon probable cause to believe it contained contraband. There was no general police-instigated exploratory search. Rather, as employee acting on his own initiative opened and inspected a container believing it contained marijuana. He was then entitled to show the contents to law enforcement personnel, who recognized and smelled the marijuana. Predicated on such probable cause, the officer's subsequent search of the packages before him was constitutionally reasonable.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, concluding that the evidence was insufficient to establish guilt and that the waiver of defendant's constitutional rights was invalid. The court found that there was no substantial evidence to link defendant to the homicide, and there seemed to be substantial evidence that defendant did not commit the act charged. The court held that defendant had not validly waived his Miranda rights and that his statements should not have been admitted into evidence. In view of defendant's unrefuted retardation and immaturity, and the fact that it was his first offense, it was unlikely that he was able to comprehend the extent of the rights he waived. Furthermore, his inability to appreciate the consequence of his statements and the waiver seemed to be reinforced by the fact that he had been asleep prior to the arrival of the police at 12:15 a.m. and his parents had awakened him just minutes before the police advised him of his Miranda rights and obtained the waiver in question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Solano County, (California), that convicted them of murder in the first degree on the grounds of the improper admission and corroboration of accomplice testimony, improper admission of evidence other crimes and wrongful acts and evidence obtained in a warrantless search.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged their convictions for murder in the first degree on the grounds that the trial court erred in admitting insufficiently corroborated accomplice testimony, in admitting evidence of other wrongs and evidence obtained from a warrantless search. Error was also assigned to jury instructions and prosecutorial remarks. The court affirmed defendants' convictions holding that there was sufficient corroborating evidence to support the accomplice testimony, where both defendants exhibited behavior that supported an inference of consciousness of guilt, as one defendant attempted to flee and hide his identity and the other defendant attempted to escape from jail. The court held that evidence of other wrongs was properly admitted within the trial court's discretion as part of testimony relating to flight or escape. The court found that although the prosecution made improper comments concerning defendants' attorney, the closing comments were harmless and did not have a likely effect on the outcome of the verdict. The court held that access to the accomplice's medical records was properly denied because there was no waiver of psychotherapist-patient privilege.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the juvenile court concluded that petitioner minor was unfit for juvenile court and ordered him to be prosecuted under the general criminal law after petitioner committed four robberies and one murder, petitioner sought peremptory writs of prohibition and mandate. The court denied the petition. The trial court's conclusory statements on unfitness for juvenile court were supported by substantial factual record. The trial court properly took into consideration the nature of the alleged crimes, the circumstances surrounding their commission, and the minor's past record and lack of rehabilitation in another state's juvenile court. Assuming that the presiding judge ordered a rehearing at the request of the district attorney rather than solely on the judge's own motion, the court could find no prejudice to petitioner since the issue of fitness was fully and fairly reheard de novo by a judge other than the one who ordered the rehearing. The other state's records showed no background of prior violent behavior, but they sufficiently showed a behavior pattern of delinquency beginning before and not improving after his commitment as a juvenile delinquent at the age of 14.</SPAN></P>

Appellant filed a writ of mandate, which the trial court denied. The court affirmed, concluding that the language &sect; 19572(t) was not unconstitutionally vague because appellant could appreciate, in advance, that her proposed conduct would constitute a &quot;failure of good behavior&quot; likely to bring discredit to her employer. Section 19572(t) did not require that appellant's failure of good behavior be known to the public in order for the behavior to cause discredit to her employer or that she communicate the misconduct to others. The evidence supported the findings of the trial court and appellee that appellant's conduct was adequate cause for the discipline imposed and that appellant was not being penalized for exercising her rights.

Although the sentencing judge had before him reports on the prior offenses and petitioner's prison behavior, it was clear from the statements made by him at the resentencing hearing that he gave them no consideration in his ultimate determination.

Defendant's death sentence was reduced to life imprisonment because the death penalty had been ruled cruel and unusual punishment under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. Trial publicity surrounding defendant's earlier guilty plea did not deny defendant a fair trial because there was no evidence the publicity prejudiced defendant or influenced the jury's verdict. Introduction of paper found in defendant's bedroom and of an envelope found in the trash did not violate defendant's privilege against self-incrimination and were not unreasonable searches and seizures as the paper was discovered after a relative gave proper search consent, and defendant had no expectation of privacy in the trash.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of selling and furnishing heroin and had a prior conviction for assault with a deadly weapon.

The police took the property anyway and found marijuana during a search of the coat pockets. Appellant challenged his conviction of marijuana possession, alleging that the search and seizure was unconstitutional. The court reversed the conviction, holding that police did not have the right to take appellant's property into custody after he refused. Furthermore, the police should not have searched the coat's pockets even if appellant had given permission to put the items into safekeeping.

Appellants sought a refund of the taxes, which the trial court denied. The lower court reversed the trial court's order. On appeal, the court agreed with the lower court and adopted the lower court's decision, which reversed the order of the trial court, because respondent did not apportion the tax to account for selling activity outside the city limits. Appellants were not immune from tax under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 2 because they broke bulk when they distributed and sold the imported automobiles to local dealers.

The court held that former Los Angeles Municipal Code &sect; 103.31, which set forth grounds for defendant's denial of permits, did not violate plaintiffs' U.S. Const. amend. I right to free speech and association, as defendant exercised its permit powers in a reasonable manner to promote the interest of the public. There was substantial evidence supporting defendant's finding that plaintiffs' operation of the rink did not comport with the peace, health, safety, convenience, good morals, and general welfare of the public, as plaintiffs failed to provide adequate parking facilities, and failed to control or prevent disturbances on or near the premises. Adequate notice was provided to plaintiffs by ordinance, by conditions expressed in the permit and compelling public necessity, and by the notice provided by defendant.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners applied for a writ of mandate challenging the constitutionality of the laws. The court held that art. II, &sect; 1 and &sect; 203 were unconstitutional. The court found that both laws violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend.

The court noted that the prevention of electoral fraud and the informed use of the ballot by voters knowledgeable about the issues, while compelling governmental interests, were not necessarily achieved by those laws. The court ordered that no residency requirements in excess of 30 days could be constitutionally imposed, and general voter registration must remain open at all times except during the 29 days immediately preceding an election.</SPAN></P>

IV because he was an outpatient from a narcotics rehabilitation center under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 3151.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After he was found guilty of a drug offense, but before judgment, defendant was committed to a narcotics rehabilitation center pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 3051. Nearly two years after he was released as an outpatient, pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 3151, the parole officer assigned to supervise defendant assisted sheriff's deputies in searching defendant's home and car, upon suspicion that he was dealing in narcotics. They justified the warrantless search on the grounds that, because he was an outpatient under &sect; 3151, he was not entitled to protection under U.S. Const. amend. IV. Defendant's motion to suppress was denied and he was subsequently convicted of drug and paraphernalia possession. Defendant appealed. In reversing, the court ruled that one's status as an outpatient did not, of itself, allow warrantless searches. Persons such as defendant did not lose their Fourth Amendment protections solely on the basis of such status and they were not deemed to have waived such rights. The narcotic addict commitment program was intended to be nonpunitive and rehabilitative and suspension of Fourth Amendment rights was not reasonably related to such purpose.</SPAN></P>

XX, &sect; 21, which empowered the legislature to create workmen's compensation benefits irrespective of fault of a party. The court held that decedent was the initial physical aggressor by definition as he initially put his opponent in reasonable fear of bodily harm. The court relied on the legislative history of the workmen's compensation act and of Cal. Const. art. XX, &sect; 21 and concluded that the legislature was not constitutionally prohibited from conditioning the right to compensation upon absence of wilful misconduct. Accordingly the judgment was affirmed because the court found that &sect; 3600(g) was constitutional and that the board did not err in failing to award compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed because the court determined that the statutory preclusion of death benefits for a worker who was an initial physical aggressor within the meaning of the governing statute was constitutional and as such the board did not err in denying benefits to decedent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sought a writ of mandate or prohibition regarding the order of respondent, Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which required petitioners to deposit a 25 percent penalty assessment pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 13521 along with their bail in order to obtain release from custody while awaiting trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After petitioners were charged with various criminal violations, respondent, trial court, required them to post bail and also to deposit the 25 percent penalty assessment (assessment), pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 13521, in order to obtain their release from custody. Thereafter, petitioners sought a writ of mandate or prohibition to stop respondent from requiring the assessment on the ground that the assessment amounted to excessive bail and, therefore, violated Cal. Const. amend. art. I, &sect; 6. On review, the court issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing respondent to eliminate any assessment as applied to petitioners' bail. The court noted that it could not determine whether the assessment was included in the amounts set as reasonable bail or was levied in addition thereto. The court found that the plain language of &sect; 13521 required the assessment to be added to the reasonable bail and thus amounted to an exacted, excessive bail. The court distinguished assessments from fines and commented that the posting of funds, although described as &quot;bail&quot; and penalties in excess thereof, for purposes other than insuring an accused's appearance in court, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a peremptory writ of prohibition directing respondent, trial court, to eliminate from petitioners' reasonable bail any penalty assessment, as exacted pursuant to statute, that was added to the bail. The court noted that any additional sum exacted, for the purpose to secure the appearance of petitioners in court, as bail or a fine was an unconstitutional excessive bail.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c12">45&nbsp;Inasmuch as today's decision is fully retroactive, any prisoner now under a sentence of death, the judgment as to which is final, may file a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the superior court inviting that court to modify its judgment to provide for the appropriate alternative punishment of life imprisonment or life imprisonment without possibility of parole specified by statute for the crime for which he was sentenced to death.  Petitions should be filed in the court of territorial jurisdiction in the first instance and transferred by that court to the sentencing court in the event the court with territorial jurisdiction was not the sentencing court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c12">The issue of the right to bail in cases in which the law has heretofore provided for the death penalty has been raised for the first time by the People and amici curiae on petition for rehearing.  Although this question was never an issue in this case, we deem it appropriate to note that article I, section 6, of the California Constitution and section 1270 of the Penal Code, dealing with the subject of bail, refer to a category of offenses for which the punishment of death could be imposed and bail should be denied under certain circumstances.  The law thus determined the gravity of such offenses both for the purpose of fixing bail before trial and for imposing punishment after conviction.  Those offenses, of course, remain the same but under the decision in this case punishment by death cannot constitutionally be exacted.  The underlying gravity of those offenses endures and the determination of their gravity for the purpose of bail continues unaffected by this decision.  Accordingly, to subserve such purpose and subject to our future consideration of this issue in an appropriate proceeding, we hold that they remain as offenses for which bail should be denied in conformity with article I, section 6, of the Constitution and Penal Code section 1270 when the proof of guilt is evident or the presumption thereof great.</SPAN></P>

The judgment was affirmed and at the second trial, on the issue of penalty for the murder, the jury again imposed the death penalty.

Defendant contended that there was error in selecting the jury, certain evidence was improperly admitted, prosecutor was guilty of prejudicial misconduct, and that the death penalty constituted cruel and unusual punishment. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment in most respects but modified the death penalty to punishment of life imprisonment. The court stated that capital punishment was unconstitutionally cruel and that a cruel punishment was proscribed irrespective of whether it was excessive. The court also stated that a prisoner under a death sentence could file a petition for writ of habeas corpus requesting the court to modify its judgment to provide for an appropriate alternative punishment and that bail should be denied in conformity with Cal.

Defendant also sought a motion to set aside the information for lack of probable cause. Both motions were denied and defendant sought a writ of prohibition to review the lower court's decision. Real party in interest, the People, contended that only the person searched could complain -- i.e., that defendant had no standing to assert the illegality of a search of a third person and prevent the evidence from being used against him at a trial under Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 351. On appeal, the court rejected the People's argument. The court concluded that the legislature did not intend to repeal the rule, and defendant was therefore entitled to the relief for which he prayed. The court concluded that defendant had standing to complain of the admittedly illegal search and seizure of a third person. The court held that since there was no competent evidence to support the information, defendant was therefore entitled to a writ of prohibition to restrain further proceedings against him on this charge.</SPAN></P>

The court held that because allowable costs are of policy as distinguished from constitutional dimension, determination of costs which were permissibly recoverable remained with the legislature rather than the courts. The court held that because there was no statutory authority for awarding litigation costs, as that term had been used in this case, the trial court properly upheld the county's objections to the cost bills.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court did not grant the prisoner a hearing, did not appoint counsel for him, determine that he desired and was competent to represent himself, and did not order that he be brought in person before the court, but merely reviewed the record on file in the case and refused to strike the prior conviction. The court previously held that &sect; 11718 violated the California Constitution and invited persons to file petitions in the exercise of discretion to dismiss the prior convictions.

The question before the court was whether under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee at a state prison suffered an industrial injury as the results of serious and wilful misconduct of another employee. Respondent, Workmen's Compensation Appeals Board, increased the employee's award by one-half pursuant to Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 4553. Appellant, Department of Corrections, contended that Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 818, prohibited punitive damage awards against a state agency. In addition, appellant contended the award violated Cal. Const. art. XX, &sect; 21. The court affirmed the award of additional benefits because the injury was caused by serious and wilful misconduct of a fellow employee. The Court held that to be classified as &quot;punitive damages,&quot; the award must be in excess of actual loss. That under the present workmen's compensation program, employees are awarded only partial compensated for their damages. And that under Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 4553, appellant was penalized in the sense that it was required to pay a higher amount of compensation by reason of the serious and wilful misconduct, the employee, however, does not receive more than full compensation for his injuries. Thus, the increased award was not a penalty.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional where its provisions went far beyond proscribing those activities that constituted littering and prohibited persons from being allowed to enter onto property to distribute or circulate written material. The court found that the First Amendment afforded persons the right to practice house-to-house distribution of written material and that the requirement of the ordinance that distributors obtain prior consent to deliver the written material would operate to curtail this means of communication and was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a probationer, was charged with burglary.

The court noted that one of the conditions of defendant's probation required him to submit to search and seizure at any time with or without a search warrant whenever requested to do so. The court concluded that the probation condition, by use of the words &quot;with or without a search warrant,&quot; had been intended to restrict defendant's right to refuse a warrantless search.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant welfare rights organization challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), which issued a peremptory mandate that ordered respondent Director of the Department of Social Welfare to issue an emergency regulation which implemented provisions of the Social Security Act set forth in 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 602(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Provisions of the Social Security Act set forth in 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 602(a) required the states to implement regulations designed to provide an incentive to employment for recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) grants by permitting them to disregard a portion of their earned income in determining whether their level of income qualified them for an AFDC payment. The disregard was available to all families except those whose earned income exceeded their standard of need and whose needs had not been met by an AFDC payment within the past four months. The Director issued a regulation providing that any family whose earned income exceeded their standard of need was entitled to the disregard if it had received an AFDC grant within the past four months. The trial court ordered respondent to issue an emergency regulation denying benefits in such cases. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that Congress intended to promote employment incentives and that the emergency regulation conflicted with the mandate in Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 11008 to permit the exclusion of earned income to the maximum extent permitted by federal law.</SPAN></P>

The emergency regulation would conflict with the statutory mandate to permit the exclusion of earned income to the maximum extent permitted by federal law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Embarcadero Municipal Improvement District (EMID) was created to promote development of uninhabited land. The district provided major services and utilities which cities normally supplied their residents. Pursuant to 1969 Cal. Stat. 174, the governing board of the district was elected pursuant to a system which vested long-term and virtually total control of the district in the hands of the developing landowner, with non-landowning residents having no vote at all. Petitioner residents of EMID instituted a mandamus proceeding that challenged the voting provisions. The court first held that the mandamus proceeding was proper because the issue was of great public importance and needed to be resolved promptly, in light of the upcoming governing board election. The court held that the one person, one vote rule which had previously been applied to state and federal governmental elections also applied to local government units having general governmental powers over a geographical area. The court held that EMID had shown no compelling state interest in the scheme, and that the voting scheme was therefore unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend XIV.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Health Facility Construction Loan Insurance Law (Law), petitioner hospitals applied for state insurance on construction loans to finance the building of health facilities. Respondent department of public health, which administered the program, declined to entertain the applications because bond counsel had raised questions regarding the legislature's power to authorize the issuance of debentures under the program. Petitioners then filed a proceeding for a writ of mandate to compel respondent to adopt necessary rules to consider the applications. The court observed that the Law was enacted after the adoption of Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 21.5, the purpose of which was to remove restrictions on the legislature's ability to create liabilities against the credit of the state insofar as necessary to permit enactment of a program of health facility construction loan insurance such as the Law. Thus, because there were no prohibitions in the constitution on the legislature's plenary authority in this regard, the court ruled that the Law was constitutional and the use of debentures was a reasonable interpretation of the language of &sect; 21.5.

Respondent trial court overruled petitioner's demurrers to the complaints and set the case for trial. Petitioner sought the writ of prohibition to restrain respondent from proceeding with the trials. The court issued the preemptory writ of prohibition because the city ordinance set no adequate standards for issuing licenses. Thus, it constituted an invalid prior restraint on the exercise of freedoms guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. I and was unconstitutional on its face. The court also held that it was constitutionally impermissible to deny an applicant a license to operate a bookstore solely upon the ground that he had suffered a prior criminal conviction.

Plaintiffs claimed that the policy had been reinstated at the time of the accident and alleged that the insurance company had accepted a late-tendered premium more than a week before the accident occurred. The court entered judgment for defendant. Plaintiffs appealed. The court concluded that the policy was in effect at the time of the accident, because under the terms of the policy, the policy was automatically reinstated if the company accepted a payment of an overdue premium without issuing a conditional receipt and without requiring an application for reinstatement. The company did accept a late payment by plaintiffs and did not notify plaintiffs until several weeks later that its initial acceptance was only a conditional one.

The court held that the system denied equal protection to plaintiffs and others similarly situated. Without deciding the merits, the court held that plaintiffs sufficiently stated their causes of action, reversed the dismissal, and remanded. The court held that the finance system discriminated against the poor because it made the quality of a child's education a function of the wealth of his parents and neighbors. The court recognized the right to an education was a fundamental interest and that wealth was a suspect classification. The court applied the strict scrutiny standard to determine whether the system violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend.

After unsuccessful attempts to dissolve the attachment and exhaustion of procedural measures on appeal, petitioners applied for an original writ to review respondent lower court's decision to maintain the attachment.

Due process required that, except in extraordinary circumstances, an individual be guaranteed a right to notice and hearing before deprivation of a significant interest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Secretary of State sought to impose penalties on the real party in interest for violating campaign election laws in Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 11890, which required that associations disclose certain financial information. After respondent court dismissed the action, petitioner filed for a writ of mandate, which the court granted. Respondent was ordered to vacate its dismissal order. Respondent erred in concluding that &sect; 11890 resulted in invidious discrimination against those campaigning for and against state propositions and was therefore unconstitutional. Petitioner had a beneficial interest in the matter, because he bore overall responsibility for administering the challenged disclosure laws. There was no showing that the disputed disclosure requirements resulted in invidious discrimination between ballot measures and candidate elections. The uncertainty engendered by respondent's order of dismissal required final resolution, so petitioner could be properly and fully informed on his public responsibilities. Thus, the mandate order compelled a determination on the merits of the underlying action.</SPAN></P>

As a result, petitioner people sought to require respondents to make the payments by burning a mandamus action. Respondents contended, however, that they were not required to make any payments because the compact was unconstitutional and void. The court rejected respondents' arguments and issued a peremptory writ of mandate based on its conclusion that the compact did not violate Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect;&sect; 11, 12, or 13. The constitutional provisions, which conferred upon local governmental bodies broad powers over purely local affairs, were not violated because the compact conferred powers upon the agency for regional purposes only and did not delegate the power to enact penal legislation to the agency. Further, the compact provision permitting respondents to impose a property tax pay the sums at issue was constitutional because the funds were raised for regional rather than local purposes.</SPAN></P>

The court held that although &sect; 25502 actually forbade a beer and wine wholesaler from holding an off-sale retail license, it also necessarily prohibited the holder of an off-sale retail license from obtaining a beer and wine wholesale license. The court held that once the retailer of alcoholic beverages acquired a wholesale beer and wine license, that retailer automatically held the wholesale license; he was accordingly a beer and wine wholesaler holding a retail liquor license, and this integration of licenses was specifically forbidden by &sect; 25502.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for rape when he was a juvenile and committed to the California Youth Authority.

The court reversed the order and remanded to the trial court. The court first held that, based upon its decision in a companion case, defendant was entitled to a jury trial on the issue of whether he was dangerous. The court held that the differences that existed among various classes of Youth Authority wards for purposes of establishing the maximum period of confinement under an original commitment were not relevant to the later determination required by &sect; 1800. The court observed that although the state needed only to show a rational connection between a statute and the legitimate purpose, where a fundamental interest in freedom was involved, the state had the burden to establish that it had a compelling interest to make the distinctions.</SPAN></P>

The court held that because a prosecutor could not be vested with authority to foreclose the exercise of a judicial power, requiring his consent to determine that an offense was a misdemeanor violated the doctrine of separation of powers, Cal. Const. art. III, &sect; 1. Under separation of powers, petitioner was entitled to have an independent determination of whether she should have been held to answer on a felony or a misdemeanor. That the power was conferred on the municipal court by statute did not prevent its exercise from being a judicial act. The exercise of a judicial power could not be conditioned upon the approval of either the executive or legislative branches of government.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted a writ of mandate issue to compel the municipal court to proceed upon the case as though petitioner had been arraigned on a misdemeanor because the requirement that the prosecutor consent before respondent could exercise the power to determine that a charged offense was to be tried as a misdemeanor was a violation of the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had ruled that the statute had been tolled. The court reversed the judgment in favor of the state. The court held that the trial court erred in ruling that the statute of limitations in &sect; 1026 was tolled. The court held that the trial court acted within its discretion in permitting the state to assert the issue of the statute of limitations at the second trial because respondents did not claim surprise not was it suggested that any additional evidence with respect to the issue might have been adduced. The court held that the law of the case doctrine did not apply because the &sect; 1026 problem was not raised by either party nor expressly determined by the trial court.

The court held that the statute violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It was not a bona fide occupational qualification exception because bartending was neither dangerous nor required strength, unpossessed by women, to maintain order. The court held that the statute violated the equal protection clauses of United States and California Constitutions. It limited the fundamental right of women to pursue a lawful vocation. Courts were divided on whether classifications based on sex should be treated as suspect. The court held them suspect because sex was immutable and had a stigma of inferiority. The court applied strict scrutiny and held that the state had no compelling interest.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 9-108 was unconstitutional on its face, violating U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV. The court found that statutes requiring licenses for parades were constitutional if they regulated only the time, place, and manner of the marches and if they were fairly administered by officials within a narrow range of discretion. The court held that &sect; 9-108 did not meet this standard because it did not specify the body charged with receiving the application and issuing the permit, and it contained no standards to govern officials in deciding to grant or deny permits.

Petitioners filed a petition for writ of mandamus against respondent court. Upon review, the court declined to issue a writ. The court refused to find &sect; 781&nbsp;unconstitutional because its provisions did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV. It held that petitioners, since they had been detained and not arrested under juvenile code, could state on all application forms that they had not been &quot;arrested,&quot; &quot;detained,&quot; or the like.

The court then concluded that the decision in Sheehan v Scott, 145 Cal. 684 (1905) should be overruled. Respondent failed to show any compelling interest why a citizen coming into the state had to wait five years before becoming eligible to the office of county supervisor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 11546 authorized local governing boards to require that subdividers must, as a condition to the approval of a subdivision map, dedicate land or pay fees in lieu thereof for park or recreational purposes. Defendant city passed Walnut Creek, Cal., Mun. Code &sect; 10-1.516 to implement this statutory provision. Plaintiff subdivider brought a suit for declaratory and injunctive relief, asserting that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause and Due Process Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and the parallel clauses of the state constitution because they deprived a subdivider of his property without just compensation. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment for defendant, finding the statute was justified by the general public need for recreational facilities, and was supported by Cal. Const. art. XVIII, relating to the maintenance and preservation of open space. The statute was a valid exercise of the state's police power because it was sufficiently related to the health and welfare of subdivision residents even if there was no showing of a direct relationship between a particular subdivision and an increase in the community's recreational needs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a union organizing committee, sought a writ of prohibition to restrain respondent, the Superior Court of Monterey County (California), from enforcing the provisions of a preliminary injunction, asserting the injunction was invalid because it restrained activities arguably protected under the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 157, 158, and because it infringed upon their rights of free speech under U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a union organizing committee and its members, called a strike, established picket lines at real party in interest agricultural employer's operations, and instituted a boycott against real party in interest's agricultural products. Respondent superior court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting petitioners from publicizing that real party in interest was engaged in a labor dispute and from boycotting or organizing boycotts of real party in interest's products. Petitioners successfully requested a writ of prohibition. The court preliminarily found that state court jurisdiction was not preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (Act), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 151 et seq., because agricultural workers were excluded from the Act. The court restrained respondent from enforcing its injunction, finding the injunction overly broad, and finding that it impinged upon petitioner's rights under U.S. Const. amend. I; the injunction effectively enjoined petitioners from making any appeal whatever to the consuming public to purchase the products of real party in interest's competitors.</SPAN></P>

Respondent could not enjoin noncoercive truthful efforts to communicate the facts of a labor dispute to the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from the order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) sustaining defendant magazine's demurrer without leave to amend in the suit alleging defendant willfully and maliciously invaded his privacy by publishing an article that truthfully stated he had hijacked a truck 11 years earlier. Defendant claimed a right to publish under U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant magazine reprinted a story truthfully recounting that plaintiff hijacked a truck, but not relating that the crime occurred 11 years earlier, and since that time, plaintiff had rehabilitated himself and led an exemplary life. The court reversed the granting of defendant's general demurrer without leave to amend, explaining that, although truthful reports of recent crimes and the names of suspects or offenders were deemed protected by the First Amendment, defendant might not have had the right to identify an actor in a report of a long past crime. The court said that where a person had rehabilitated himself, society should have permitted him to continue in the path of rectitude. Additionally, limitation to newsworthy persons and events did not foreclose an interpretation to allow damages where revelations might have been so intimate and so unwarranted as to outrage the community's notions of decency. The court ruled that a jury might have found that defendant crossed that line.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced defendant to life imprisonment with possibility of parole on the kidnaping counts and to the terms prescribed by law on the robbery counts. The court of appeal affirmed the conviction. Defendant then sought postconviction relief. The court relied on its own precedent and held that movement across a room or from one room to another could not reasonably be found to be asportation within the meaning of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 209. Additionally such movements were merely incidental to the robberies and did not substantially increase the risk of harm beyond that inherent in the robberies. The court therefore denied state's motion to dismiss the appeal, and ordered the cause retransferred to the court of appeal. The court of appeal was directed to recall its remittitur and to issue a new remittitur vacating the kidnapping counts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners challenged certain credit rules created by the Public Utilities Commission (commission). These rules were adopted as part of the utilities' rate tariffs for the purpose of reducing bad debt losses and provided that unless credit was established in one or another of several specified ways, an applicant was required to make a deposit to secure utility service. The court of appeals upheld the credit rules, finding that they did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Permitting some persons to escape the deposit requirement and compelling others to pay or meet credit conditions was reasonable in light of the purpose behind the rules, which was to reduce bad debt losses. The commission could have reasonably concluded that persons who could satisfy none of the alternative methods of establishing credit other than by making a deposit presented greater risks of bad debt losses than those who could satisfy one or more of those alternatives.</SPAN></P>

On appeal the court, after reviewing the caselaw behind redistricting for both local and federal elections, held that, unless the apportionment plan produced districts containing roughly equal numbers of people as opposed to registered voters, the plan failed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff and intervenor sought judicial review of an agency decision determining that a proposed recapitalization plan was supported by substantial evidence.

On review the court noted that the agency's decision was based on its expertise in the matter and that the determination that the recapitalization plan was fair, just, and equitable and should not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion or a finding that the record was not supported by substantial evidence. The court noted that, because the decision was supported by substantial evidence, no independent review was authorized by Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1094.5. The court further noted that the legislature gave the agency wide discretion to make such decisions and as long as no fundamental right that has vested was abridged, judicial review was also precluded.

Defendant appealed the judgement arguing that that tax exceeded plaintiff's constitutional powers and was a violation of defendant's constitutional rights as a taxpayer insofar as it was based upon the total gross receipts derived by defendant from wholesale sales of gas delivered from within the city to retailers located outside the city. The court agreed noting that only gross receipts directly attributable to selling activities carried on in the city were taxable. The court held that an apportionment should have been made to determine the exact amounts directly attributable to sales carried in and out of the city limits.

The state sought to collect inheritance taxes. The trial court held that respondent was exempt from inheritance taxes. The state appealed. The court found that when a decedent spouse conveyed to a surviving spouse a power of appointment over any portion of the decedent spouse's half interest in the community property, the surviving spouse was liable for inheritance taxes levied on the value of the property subject to the power of appointment in excess of the value of a life estate in the decedent spouse's half of the community property, Cal.

On appeal, the court reversed holding that defendant owed his mother neither a statutory nor a common law duty of support. The court held that defendant's mother was not a &quot;poor person&quot; as defined by Cal. Civ.

Appellant was arrested under respondent city's &quot;hippie&quot; ordinance while sitting on the grass in a city park and charged with unlawful sitting on a public lawn. Appellant's arrest took place during her participation in a public assembly called to discuss the new &quot;hippie&quot; ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city passed an ordinance regulating use of public parks, disallowing, among other things, tree climbing, walking, standing, or sitting upon monuments or sitting on the lawns, or littering and loitering. The court held that the ordinance was invalid because it had an underlying discriminatory purpose. The court found a predictable discriminatory impact when the ordinance used official code language in its emergency declaration to single out the social group &quot;hippies.&quot; When the ordinance language stigmatized &quot;hippies&quot; as &quot;undesirable&quot; and &quot;unsanitary,&quot; the city council violated the constitutional guaranty of the equal protection of the laws. The description of &quot;undesirable&quot; and &quot;unsanitary&quot; persons referred to as &quot;transients&quot; could not be squared with the claimed neutral purpose of preventing all persons from sitting or lying on the grass in order to protect it from undue wear. The irrefutable implication was that the city sought to rid the city of the blight it perceived to be created by the presence of the &quot;hippies.&quot; The court concluded that the ordinance violated the equal protection clause, and reversed the order denying appellant's petition for a writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city's &quot;hippie&quot; ordinance was found to violate the United States Constitution because, while it claimed neutrality in its purpose of keeping all people from sitting on the grass, it branded &quot;hippies&quot; as an undesirable group of transients whose presence threatened the well-being of the city, thus showing an underlying discriminatory purpose. The court reversed the order denying appellant merchant's petition for a writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As defendants, the real parties in interest, were pulling over after being detained for speeding, the officer saw one bend over and reach under the seat. The driver exited the car and exited toward the officer. The officer immediately opened the passenger car door and looked inside, saw some stems and seeds, and conducted a search which revealed marijuana. At trial, the officer testified he wanted to see what had been hidden. The trial court granted defendants' motion to suppress and the People sought a writ of mandate. The court denied the writ, finding that the search was unreasonable. The circumstances justifying the arrest for speeding, including the furtive gesture, did not furnish probable cause to search the car. Defendants were cooperative and admitted speeding. A search prompted by a general curiosity to ascertain what, if anything, was within defendants' vehicle was manifestly exploratory in nature, and violated U.S. Const. amend. IV. The officer did not testify to any facts that would have given him cause to believe defendants were hiding contraband, and probable cause was tested by facts known to the officer at the time the search was made.</SPAN></P>

After judgment was entered, the trial court amended the abstract of judgment to reflect the prior conviction and thereby enhance petitioner's sentence. In his petition for writ of habeas corpus, petitioner argued that the trial court was without jurisdiction to amend the judgment and that in so doing double jeopardy was violated. The court did not find that double jeopardy was violated, but otherwise agreed with this contention. The amendment was invalid because the amendment materially altered petitioner's rights and hence could not have been made under the trial court's authority to correct a clerical error. The court reasoned the record's silence as to the prior conviction operated as a finding that the prior conviction was not true. Accordingly, the court denied the writ, but directed that petitioner's sentence and his eligibility for parole was to be determined by the original abstract of judgment.</SPAN></P>

On petition for hearing, petitioner contended that respondent should have granted the motion. The reviewing court agreed with this contention. The court found that the amendment to Cal. Prob.

The court reasoned that the state of California lacked any present interest in the property because the probate court had not yet made an order of distribution to the state under Cal. Prob.

The court reasoned that an inmate convicted of violating a statute subsequently declared unconstitutional was entitled to relief regardless of whether it was entered upon a guilty plea, because an unconstitutional law was void, an offense created by it was not a crime, and a conviction under it was not merely erroneous, but was illegal and void. The court held that because petitioner was convicted at a bench trial and the priors were not used for impeachment, the trial judge was presumed to have properly disregarded the priors in determining petitioner's guilt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A gun was recovered pursuant to a search warrant. The warrant was subsequently found to be insufficient. However, the gun led the police to an arrest report signed by the victims of a robbery. The police interviewed the victims, who identified defendants by photographs as the perpetrators of the robbery. Defendants contended that but for the illegal search and seizure of the gun, the police would not have connected them with the robbery and therefore the testimony of the victims was the product of the illegal search and seizure, and should have been suppressed. The court denied defendants a writ of mandate and held that the purpose of deterring unlawful police conduct would not have been further advanced by suppression of the victims' testimony because such would have been admissible to establish defendants' guilt of the crime, notwithstanding the chance disclosure of their connection during a wholly unrelated police investigation. The court found that the illegal search had not been directed towards discovery of the victims, and that the purpose of deterring unlawful police conduct had been adequately served by suppression of the gun and evidence of other crimes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendants a writ of mandate to compel respondent trial court to suppress victims' testimony as fruit of an illegal search, although the gun which led to defendants' charges for robbery was obtained by an insufficient warrant, because the connection to the victims was not sufficient to characterize the victims' testimony as tainted, and that the illegal search had not been directed to the discovery of the victims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant electors of the city of Alviso filed a claim contesting the results of an election to determine whether Alviso would consolidate with respondent city. At trial, appellant submitted evidence that individuals who were not residents of Alviso were permitted to vote, that residents of Alviso were promised consideration for their votes, and that some voters were not required to take the statutory residence oath prior to voting. Appellants demonstrated that nine of the illegal votes came from individuals who had signed a petition for consolidation. Though the trial court found that 11 of the votes were illegal, and total vote difference was 9 votes, the trial court only found that it could determine how two of these votes were cast. The trial court split the remaining 9 votes 50-50 and upheld the election. In reversing the judgment, the court found that since nine of the illegal votes came from voters who signed a pro-consolidation petition, and respondent made no effort to show that these votes were cast inconsistently with the petition, the necessary conclusion was that all nine votes were cast for consolidation, and thus the trial court's split of these votes were error.</SPAN></P>

After a criminal conviction, petitioner, who was indigent, was sentenced to probation and payment of a fine, or imprisonment if he did not pay the fine. Because of the constitutional question, the court held petitioner presented special circumstances such that he did not need to exhaust appeals. The court held the sentence required imprisonment because petitioner could not pay the fine whereas a wealthier criminal could escape confinement, and, therefore, discriminated on the basis of wealth, a suspect classification. The court applied strict scrutiny to &sect;&sect; 1205 and 13521 and held imprisonment was not constitutionally necessary in this case to promote the assumed state interest in rehabilitation because other alternatives for collection of fines were available, which did not discriminate on the basis of poverty, and that such options must be made available to an indigent offender.

Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11531. At his detention hearing, the juvenile court indicated that the minor would be detained until his jurisdictional hearing because it was that court's policy to detain juveniles who sold marijuana. The juvenile court did not hear any testimony by the probation officer, consider his report under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.

The court issued a show cause order and directed that the minor be released from custody until his jurisdictional hearing. The court rejected respondent's contention that the case was moot; although the minor's proceedings were over, his case represented a line of cases that was capable of repetition, yet evading review. The juvenile court erred in formulating a policy detaining juveniles charged with certain crimes. A consideration of the relevant factors under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.

The court held that petitioner's husband under Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 5000 was entitled to compromise any claims of dependents to worker's compensation death benefits. The court found that petitioner did not have a independent and separate right to the death benefit because &sect; 5000 specifically conferred the power to an employee to release workmen's compensation benefits.

The court held that the two-thirds requirement violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court reasoned that the right to vote was a fundamental right, thus, the provision was subject to strict scrutiny, and that respondents failed to prove that it was necessary for any compelling state interest.

The court found that pursuant to a recent decision, mutual inmate legal assistance was constitutionally necessary. Thus, a prison regulation prohibiting the possession of legal papers belonging to another inmate was invalid. To the extent one petitioner complained that he was prevented from filing an application for relief for another prisoner, his writ was denied. It was the prisoner for whom the application for relief was to have been filed who had the right to gain access to the courts. Petitioners did not have a right to correspond with inmates at other institutions or to interview inmates in isolation. Limitation of access to the prison library was not applied in a discriminatory manner or with a view to limit access to the courts. Under Cal.

Petitioner was subsequently convicted of violating Cal.

In a habeas corpus proceeding, the court denied his petition, holding that his sentence had been properly increased by the prior conviction. The court found that petitioner had not met his burden of proving that his prior conviction had been based not upon the constitutional but upon the unconstitutional provisions of Cal.

The appellate court denied the writ, holding the order did not infringe on petitioner's constitutional rights, as he had no absolute privilege concerning the confidentiality of psychotherapeutic communications. The presence of a legislatively created absolute clergyman-penitent privilege did not render the absence of an absolute psychotherapist-patient privilege a denial of equal protection because of the legislatively tolerated scope of the clergyman-penitent relationship.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and directed issuance of writ of prohibition preventing trial court from proceeding to trial on petitioners actors charges of violating Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 647(a) and 311.6 for performing in a play and aiding and abetting in these violations. The court concluded that these statutes were not intended to apply to a live theatrical performance before an audience, and that the application of the provisions to such performance violated petitioners' constitutional rights to free speech, due process and equal protection of the laws, under U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV, and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 9, 11, 13 and 21. The court found that the purpose of &sect; 647 was to punish the crime of vagrancy, and that nothing in the legislative history indicated that it was intended to apply to activities, like theatrical performances, which are within the ambit of amend I. protection. The court concluded it would be irrational to impose upon an actor in a theatrical performance or its director a lifetime requirement of registration as a sexual offender under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 290 because he may have performed or aided in the performance of an act, perhaps an obscene gesture, in a play.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 403, a misdemeanor, and were sentenced to four months in jail. After the appellate department of the superior court affirmed their conviction, and the court of appeal refused certification, petitioners sought a writ of habeas corpus, claiming violation of free speech and due process of law of the United States and California Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner protestors attended a meeting at which a congressman spoke, and they disturbed his speech by rhythmical clapping and shouting. They were convicted of disturbing a lawful meeting in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 403. After their appeal was denied, they sought a writ of habeas corpus to determine the constitutionally permissible bounds of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 403. The court granted the writ and set aside the judgment. If literally applied with the breadth of coverage that its terms could encompass, &sect; 403 would be unconstitutionally overbroad. Rather than enacting monolithic standards, &sect; 403 drew its content from the implicit customs and usages or explicit rules germane to a given meeting. Violation of customs or rules by one who knew or, as a reasonable man, should have known of them would justify the application of &sect; 403. The prosecution offered no evidence that clapping, flag waving, and sloganeering were not generally accepted and permitted at a public meeting, addressed by controversial elected officials, or that the activities substantially impaired the conduct of the meeting.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the writ and set aside the judgment against petitioners, concluding that their conduct did not fall within the constitutionally compelled meaning of the statute, and that the trial court erred in failing to designate the constitutionally compelled limits of the broad statutory language. Habeas corpus was the appropriate remedy, as the statute could not constitutionally be applied to the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff outdoor advertising company owned billboards on various private parcels that it leased in defendant county.

The lower court held that defendant's ordinance was null and void, and defendant appealed. The court held that the removal requirements of the ordinance could validly be applied to certain of plaintiff's billboards, but that as to others removal should await expiration of appropriate amortization periods. The court further held that plaintiff's evidence failed to show arbitrariness and unreasonableness with respect to the signs that had fully been amortized. The court noted that plaintiff produced no evidence with respect to present actual value of any of the signs, or relating to amortization of any such value, nor did it prove that the remaining signs could not be used elsewhere.

The court also held that because California procedure contained more safeguards for a defendant than federal procedure, California procedure could not violate the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment where the United States Supreme Court had already held that federal procedure did not violate the confrontation clause. Thus the asserted misconduct afforded no basis for concluding that the court erred in denying the motion for severance.

The trial court entered judgment in favor of the city, finding that the setting and payment of salaries for the city's own employees were municipal affairs to which, under the home rule provisions of Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect;&sect; 6, 8, the prevailing wage provisions of Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 1770 et seq. did not apply. The court held that the trial court correctly ruled that Cal. Lab. Code &sect;&sect; 1724, 1771, 1773, indicated that the legislature had not intended that the prevailing wage laws apply to the setting of the salaries of the city's employees, and, specifically, that &sect; 1771 did not apply to work carried out by a public agency with its own forces.</SPAN></P>

Immediately after the editorial appeared, the politician demanded a correction, but it was never published. She filed an action against the publisher claiming that the article was libelous against her and her children and that it invaded her children's privacy. The publisher claimed that his qualified privilege protected him from libel and that the politician had not given the publisher adequate notice of her demand for a correction. As to the children's right of privacy, the publisher claimed that the matters were of public interest. The lower court agreed and dismissed the case. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the right to privacy claim.

On appeal, the court reversed the department's decision and remanded for reconsideration of a penalty consistent with Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 24755.1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver had been accused of improper and unsafe passing, Cal. Veh.

The driver urged that &sect; 20002(a), a &quot;hit-and-run&quot; provision, was unconstitutional as applied because it violated the driver's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The court held that while the Fifth Amendment privilege was applicable to the question of the driver's compliance with the &quot;hit-and-run&quot; statute, the driver should have complied because of use-restrictions which he could only have speculated might exist. While the judgment could not be affirmed on the theory that the driver was privileged to withhold the &sect; 20002(a) information, fairness dictated that the driver should not be punished for his failure to comply with &sect; 20002(a). Where compliance with &sect; 20002(a) would otherwise be excused by the self-incrimination privilege, compliance was mandatory; and state prosecuting authorities were precluded from using the disclosed information or its fruits in connection with any criminal prosecution related to the accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. No valid purpose would be served by requiring the driver to belatedly comply with the &quot;hit-and-run&quot; statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) sentencing him to two years probation after he was convicted of abortion and conspiracy to commit an abortion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a physician, was convicted of abortion, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 274, and conspiracy to commit an abortion, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 182. The trial court imposed a $ 5000 fine and placed defendant on probation for two years. On appeal, defendant challenged the order imposing probation. The court found that the validity of &sect; 274 could not be sustained. The court explained that the pressures on a physician to decide not to perform an absolutely necessary abortion were, under &sect; 274, enormous, and because &sect; 274 authorized and required a doctor to decide, at his peril, whether an abortion was necessary, a woman whose life was at stake could be as effectively condemned to death as if the law flatly prohibited all abortions. Because &sect; 274 was invalid, defendant was wrongfully convicted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order convicting defendant of abortion and conspiracy to commit an abortion was reversed and the indictment against him was dismissed.</SPAN></P>
