The court noted that the individual did not become eligible for retirement from one of the state systems before the effective date of the challenged statute, and thus had no vested right in the retirement system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff non-resident husband, through a court-appointed curator, appealed a judgment of the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans, Division E (Louisiana) granting an original alimony award after the husband was cited through a curator. The issues were whether the trial court lost jurisdiction over the husband when the divorce judgment divorce became final and whether La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:3201(f) authorized long arm service on him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant wife, not having sought alimony, was granted a divorce. After the husband moved out of state, the wife filed a rule seeking post-divorce alimony. The trial court appointed a curator to represent the husband and awarded alimony to the wife. On appeal, the court held that, because the rule for alimony required a court appearance, under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1314, the citation had to be served either on the husband or on his attorney of record. No such service was made. The court held that, because the claim for alimony was a new proceeding, separate from the divorce judgment, to hold that the trial court retained jurisdiction over the person of the husband to adjudicate his liability for permanent alimony without his having had notice that such a claim was made would deprive him of his right to procedural due process. Service of a post-divorce alimony demand through a court-appointed curator did not satisfy the requirement. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:3201(f) did not authorize the use of the long arm statute for a proceeding seeking alimony for the first time under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 160 after a divorce had been obtained; such would be a breach of due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and rendered judgment dismissing the wife's suit with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gubernatorial candidate (candidate) filed an action against appellees contesting the result of a recent gubernatorial primary.

After the candidate rested his case, appellees made oral motions for a directed verdict under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1810, which were granted by the trial court. The trial court's judgment was affirmed on appeal. The court agreed with the trial court's finding that the candidate had failed to make out a prima facie case under La. Rev. Stat.

The court determined that broad generalizations with no buttressing facts, unsupported conclusions of law, and repeated accusations of racism was simply insufficient. The court further held that the decision to exclude the landowner's property was based on the lengthy drilling time to reach the desired foot level, the shortage of proper equipment together with the number of wells needed to delineate the reservoir limits.</SPAN></P>

The purchaser sought review and the court reversed. According to the court, the husband need not be served with a notice of seizure under art. 2293 prior to the sale of the property under art. 4607. Art. 4607 addressed partitions and required only the rule with respect to advertisements required for judicial sales under execution. No evidence indicated that the sheriff failed to duly advertise the sale in the manner provided by law. No rules from arts. 2331 and 2293 relating to seizure or a notice of seizure were made applicable to partition sales under the clear language of art. 4607. The court would not subject the co-owners in a partition proceeding to the rules of seizure and notice of seizure that were found in the articles governing the execution of money judgments.</SPAN></P>

The husband failed to raise the issue of the unconstitutionality of art. 148 in the trial court, and therefore, the court held that it could not consider the issue on appeal. The court also concluded that although the wife had a job and was earning a salary, she did not earn enough money to support herself. As such, the trial court properly allowed her a sum for support based on her earnings and needs and the husband's earnings. Finally, the court held that the award was not excessive. The trial court disagreed with the husband's computation in determining the net income and expenses for his wife and himself. There were duplications in considering the expenses and some of the amounts were speculative and unproven.

In response to this rule, the husband filed an exception of no cause of action based on his allegation that La. Civ.

Writs were granted, and an order staying the proceedings as to permanent alimony was issued. The wife was also granted a suspensive appeal of the divorce judgment. The court noted at the outset that La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 160 had recently been amended by Act 72 of 1979 to provide that both a wife and husband could obtain alimony after divorce. The effective date of the act was after the writs were granted but would apply to the alimony at issue. The court held that it was unnecessary to determine whether the statute, as it existed prior to amendment, was unconstitutional. Accordingly, it recalled the writs and vacated its order staying the proceedings below.</SPAN></P>

The father opposed the adoption on the ground that he had just cause for failing to provide support. The father alleged that he was justified in failing to make support payments because of an agreement made between him and the mother. The agreement provided that if the father ceased claiming the daughter as an exemption on his income tax returns and permit the mother and the husband to claim the exemption, that the father would not be required to make any further court-ordered support payments. The lower court granted the application for adoption. On appeal the court reversed and rendered.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Certain highway advertisers sought to enjoin the removal of highway signs pursuant to Act 187 of 1978, legislation that amended state law to provide for highway beautification. The advertisers contended that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:461.23, a new section added by 1978 La. Acts 187 was unconstitutional in that it provided an exemption from removal for only those signs lawfully erected prior to May 5, 1976. Admitting that their signs were unlawfully erected, the advertisers contended nonetheless that the statute created an arbitrary and unreasonable distinction between lawful and unlawful signs. The trial court granted the advertisers a preliminary injunction. On review, the court held that the advertisers could not claim that they were constitutionally discriminated against because their unlawful conduct was treated differently than someone else's lawful conduct. The court also found untenable the advertisers' claim that the legislation discriminated against different types of unlawful conduct, because in fact it did not. Under the legislation, all unlawful signs had to be removed, regardless of when they were constructed. Accordingly, the court found no constitutional infirmity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the preliminary injunction granted to the highway advertisers and rendered judgment in favor of the State DTOD, thereby dismissing the advertisers' class action suit challenging the constitutionality of a law requiring removal of certain highway signs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were divorced by judgment in 1978, wherein the husband was ordered to pay $ 75 per month alimony to the wife. Then, the wife petitioned for an increase in alimony from $ 75 to $ 500 per month, alleging that the husband's earnings had substantially increased since the original judgment. The husband petitioned to terminate alimony entirely, alleging that the wife was not in necessitous circumstances and that La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 160 was unconstitutional, as it only provided for divorced wives and discriminated against divorced husbands. The district court dismissed both assertions, finding the circumstances of the parties had changed but not substantially enough to award a change in alimony. The district court did not deal with the constitutional issue. Both parties appealed. On review, the court held that the wife continued to have necessitous circumstances and allowed the alimony to continue as it was set at the time of divorce. Her needs did not require an increase based on her income. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional and that the constitutional issue was moot based on the effective date of amendment to the statute.</SPAN></P>

The statute did not penalize illegitimate children, but denied parental rights to fathers who had the opportunity but failed to change the child's status by acknowledging or legitimating the child.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner had an opportunity to lease 13 acres of his land for 55 years as a shopping center. The landowner's property was zoned for residential use, but he sought to rezone the land to allow for the establishment of commercial ventures on the property. The neighborhood was opposed to the zoning change. The court affirmed. The landowner's contention that the city council's action did not conform to a comprehensive plan as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:4723 was without merit. The city's zoning ordinance entitled Comprehensive Zoning Law of the City of Lake Charles met the requirements of such a plan because it provided a scheme of uniformity in zoning to be followed by the city council for the benefit of the community as a whole as required by the statute. The city council's action was reasonable and was not based solely on neighborhood opposition. Most of the land was developed for residential purposes and there was testimony that the tract had considerable financial potential if townhouses were constructed thereon.

The bus driver attacked his dismissal as a probationary or non-tenured school bus driver. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:492, each school bus operator had to serve a probationary term of three years. The bus driver testified that he never received a letter of discharge. The trial court concluded to the contrary, and the appellate court agreed with this factual finding. Further, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:91 provided that a parish superintendent of schools could act and perform all of the duties of the secretary of the school board. The court held that the discharge letter constituted sufficient notice from the school board of the bus driver's dismissal. Further, when the legislature provided that a probationary school bus driver could be discharged simply for valid reasons, there was a large measure of discretion to school boards. By &quot;valid reason&quot; was meant a sound and sufficient reason. In the instant action, both reasons given related directly to the safety and welfare of the children.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer was investigating a complaint about two suspicious males lurking about a neighborhood. He spotted plaintiff, who was sitting down outside his house, waiting for his father to take him to work. When plaintiff responded to the officer's inquiries with some choice invectives, the officer continued the interrogation with his billy club, and with back-up, toted plaintiff off to jail. In reversing the judgment, the court found no manifest error in the trial court's finding that plaintiff struck first. Instead, the court held that the trial court erred in applying the law of false arrest to the facts. The court held that the officer never had any lawful grounds for arresting plaintiff, and that plaintiff could use reasonable force to resist an unlawful arrest, thus the employment of the billy club was a battery. The court noted that a person was at liberty to refuse an officer's inquiries, even to the point of cursing the officer, and that neither the refusal nor the abuse constituted resisting arrest or criminal mischief, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:108(c), 14:59(7).</SPAN></P>

The district court held that the plaintiff was entitled to access her original birth certificate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was adopted in 1949 when she was 3 years old. At issue in the case was plaintiff's entitlement to her original birth certificate. Under the 1977 version of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:80, adoption records were sealed by law. A 1978 amendment to the Act purported to make the 1977 Act retroactive. The purpose behind the act was to encourage adoption over abortion by making the identity of the birth mother and father inaccessible to the child. The lower court held that plaintiff was entitled to access her original birth certificate. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that plaintiff's entitlement to access to her original birth certificate was not affected by the 1978 Act purporting to make the 1977 Act retroactive. The court reasoned that the 1977 Act is by itself prospective and did not affect plaintiff's pre-existing entitlement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer corporation brought an action against the collector of revenue requesting a refund of $ 31,000 on the ground that the regulations as to the statutory definition of &quot;cost price&quot; were in error. The collector of revenue denied the refund. On appeal by the taxpayer corporation, the board of tax appeals entered an order directing that the refund be made on the ground that the use tax regulation was unconstitutional. The collector of revenue sought judicial review, and the trial court upheld the decision of the board of tax appeals. On further judicial review, the court set the trial court judgment aside. The court found that the taxpayer corporation did not pay the tax under protest and thus had no right of action under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1576. Further, the court found that the taxpayer corporation had a right of action under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1481. But, the board of tax appeals exceeded its authority in ordering the refund under &sect; 47:1481, because any amount over $ 1,000, which was approved by the board of tax appeals, had to be submitted to the legislature.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner owned a tract of land, the majority of which was zoned multi-family residential and a portion of which was zoned single family residential. He petitioned the zoning commission to rezone his land to a new classification in order to construct a mobile home park. In accordance with the zoning commission's recommendation, the mayor and board of aldermen rejected the proposed rezoning. The landowner filed an action for a writ of mandamus contending that the refusal to grant his requested zoning change was improper. The trial judge granted an injunction and ordered defendants to rezone the property. On appeal, the court reversed. Though the landowner proved that the proposed mobile home park would not create the problems anticipated by defendants, he did not meet the burden of proof required of one asking a court to substitute its views for those of a municipal governing body. The landowner was required to show that the current zoning of the property was unreasonable, in addition to showing the merits of his requested zoning change. The trial judge erred in granting the landowner's requested injunction because he failed to show that the current zoning was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was an unmarried man without descendants. After he was killed in a work-related accident, his mother filed a wrongful death suit against his employer and its liability insurer. The employer and the liability insurer filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1032, the exclusive remedy available was afforded by workmen's compensation law. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the employer and the liability insurer, and the decedent's mother appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that the statutory language was unambiguous and clearly indicated that the exclusive remedy for an injured employee, his personal representative, his dependents, or his relations was through workmen's compensation law. The court rejected the constitutional arguments of the decedent's mother, concluding that a non-dependent mother's right to recover for the wrongful death of her son was not a fundamental right and that the exclusive remedy provisions of the workmen's compensation act did not preclude an adequate remedy under La.

Thereafter, the mother and the father filed a rule to show cause why the trial court's order should not be dismissed. The trial court denied the motion, and the mother and father filed an application with the court for supervisory writs. The court held that although the trial court originally issued its order upon being presented with an affidavit which convincingly established good cause for temporary removal and placement of the child, that order expired when no hearing was held within 45 days after its issuance, and the trial court's attempt to extend the order or continue its existence was incorrect. Therefore, that order had to be dismissed. However, that order related only to the placement of the child, and the expiration of the order did not affect the child abuse proceedings based on facts alleged in the petition, which was filed after the completed investigation. Accordingly, the court granted the application for supervisory writs but remanded the matter to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court explained that the instanter order and the abuse proceeding were distinct matters, and the expiration of the instanter order did not prejudice the State's right to prosecute the abuse proceeding.

The trial court entered judgment for the wife for alimony, found the husband in contempt of court for failure to pay accrued alimony, reduced the amount of alimony, and awarded attorney's fees to the wife. Both the husband and the wife appealed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Third-party plaintiff, a general contractor, filed an appeal from a judgment of the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) that upheld a peremptory exception to a demand for third-party indemnification.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Third party plaintiff, a general contractor, appealed from a judgment upholding dilatory and peremptory exceptions to a demand for third-party indemnification. When structural failures were discovered within 10 years from the completion of a school, plaintiff school board sued the contractors and architects who built it. Third-party defendant, the clerk-of-the-works for construction, raised preemptory exceptions including no cause of action. The district court held that any action had been barred by a statute of limitations, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2772. The general contractor argued that &sect; 9:2772 was not applicable because it did not become effective until almost four years after the school board filed its acceptance of construction, and that to apply it would give it retroactive application. The court found that the clear intent of the statute was to limit the time within which actions could be brought to a certain period after completion of the improvement. Since the statute was remedial in nature, it could be applied retroactively even in the absence of language to that effect. As to the dilatory exception for improper citation, the lower court's order was insufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in favor of third party defendant, clerk-of-the-works. As to the order finding that another third-party defendant was improperly cited, the court ordered third-party plaintiff to properly cite the third-party defendant or its action would be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant wife appealed a judgment of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which awarded damages to plaintiff custodial husband for the wife's removal of the children. The issues were whether such a tort existed, whether certified copies of another state's decrees were properly excluded, whether a nonresident writ of attachment should have been dissolved, and whether the quantum was adequate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the course of complicated litigation, the wife was held in contempt and she fled with the children to another state. It took 35 days for the husband to locate them. In the suit at bar, he obtained jurisdiction over the wife by attaching real property she owned in Jefferson Parish. On appeal, the court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:45A(4), the simple kidnapping statute, was the basis of the wife's legal duty owed to the husband and the breach of that duty was actionable under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315. The breach was clear and the husband had a cause of action in tort. The court held that there was no relevance to certified copies of documents related to the decrees in an out-of-state action filed after the wife's flight from Louisiana. None of the wife's procedural arguments against the use of the nonresident writ of attachment had merit and the procedure did not violate due process of law and was not unconstitutional. On the husband's claim for additional damages, the court held that, in addition to damages for the 35-day period spent in locating the children, plus expenses, he was also entitled to the expenses of the efforts he undertook to recover them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court increased the damages awarded to the husband and affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant official appealed a judgment of the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Evangeline, State of Louisiana, which granted plaintiff residents a declaration that the official violated La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:31.1B(2) and vacated his position as school board member when he took the oath as mayor and ordered him to return compensation received as a member after that time and to refrain from performing his duties as a member.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An official held the office of town mayor, which term expired in July 1982, and the office of parish school board member, which expired in January 1983. The court affirmed the judgment of the town and parish residents declaring that the official violated the valid provisions of &sect; 42:31.1 by simultaneously holding the elective government offices of school board member and mayor. The court held that the prohibition against dual office-holding in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:31.1B(2) had a rational basis in preventing a pyramid of power and an adverse effect on freedom of expression by others and did not interfere with the official's constitutional rights of freedom of speech or equal protection. The court reversed the judgment declaring the school board position vacant, enjoining the official from performing those duties, and ordering him to return all compensation received after he took that office. The court held that the trial court erred in applying &sect; 42:31.1B(2) because the office of mayor expired first and that office should have been declared vacant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the residents' judgment declaring that the statute against simultaneously holding two elective offices was valid and had been violated by the official.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school board challenged the trial court's judgment by which a writ of mandamus directed it to grant sabbatical leave to two teachers who were on maternity leave. Both teachers sought their sabbaticals at the expiration of their maternity leaves. The school board denied both requests. The court reversed and vacated and found that under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:1171, in order to qualify for a one-semester sabbatical leave, the teachers had to have had six consecutive semesters of active service immediately prior to the grant of the leave, or had to have had 12 consecutive semesters of active service prior to the grant of a two-semester leave. The court found that because the legislature enacted a separate maternity leave law, &sect; 17:1211, it was clear that it did not intend that the active service time required for sabbatical eligibility under &sect; 17:1171 did not include maternity leave. The court noted that the school board properly maintained the teachers' active service status during the childbearing period. The court held that the teacher who wished to remain with her infant child past the six-week childbearing period interrupted her active service.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A claimant applied for unemployment benefits after retiring from her position as a schoolteacher at the age of 65. The department denied her application based upon a questionnaire she completed upon retirement in which she stated that she would only be available for volunteer work on a part-time basis. The claimant also signed a form stating that she did not seek employment because no one would hire anyone over 65 years of age. Benefits were denied pursuant to La. Rev. Stat.

The department found that the claimant was, by her own admission, not available for work within the wording of the statute. Both the Louisiana Board of Review and trial court affirmed the denial of benefits. The court affirmed on appeal. The court agreed that the claimant was not available for work within the meaning of &sect; 23:1600 where she arbitrarily removed herself from available work by restricting her willingness to certain hours or to conditions not usual or customary in the occupation.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to the landowners' action the lower court rendered an ex parte order that certified the action as a class action. The levee board sought by writ of certiorari review of the decision. On review the court reversed and set-aside. The court held that the landowners' action presented many questions of law or fact that were not common to all members of the proposed class. The court concluded that multiple sub-issues were presented, that divide the proposed class into numerous sub-classes, and possibly required a separate determination of the respective right of the levee board and each individual landowner in relation to each individual tract of land.</SPAN></P>

The district court affirmed the agency's denial of the owners' application for a liquor license based on the municipal ordinance prohibiting the sale of alcohol. The owners appealed, arguing that that the area annexed into the city was not bound by the subject ordinance because an exercise of local option on a parish-wide basis was in contravention of La.

The court agreed, holding that the district court erred in holding that the city obtained vested rights in the enforcement of its local option ordinance which would allow it to prohibit liquor by the drink in the area later annexed into the city. The court held that the owners' property was a &quot;wet&quot; area when it was annexed into the city because there had been no valid local option election prohibiting liquor sales in that area and by its assimilation into the corporate limits, and therefore, the property was not subject to prohibitions under the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The natural mother was now a resident of California and was divorced from the natural father. The natural mother was awarded custody of the child. A subsequent order gave custody to the natural father and granted the natural mother reasonable visitation and she was not required to contribute to the child's support. At the change of custody hearing, it was established that the child's welfare was endangered by his mother's custody, because she was neglectful, an itinerant alcoholic, and married to a man who mentally and physically abused the child. The father's present wife, the stepmother, sought to adopt the child. The mother opposed the adoption. The lower court rejected the stepmother's petition for adoption and stated that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:422.1 only contemplated a father's failure to send child support and did not apply to mothers. The court held that the lower court's sexist interpretation was unconstitutional under La.

The trial court found that the widow's petition did not allege the type of &quot;intentional acts&quot; necessary to avoid dismissal under &sect; 23:1032. On appeal, the court remanded to provide the widow with an opportunity to amend her petition under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 934, and otherwise affirmed. The court held that &sect; 23:1032 did not violate the widows rights to due process, equal protection, or access to the courts under La. Const. 1974, art. I, &sect;&sect; 2,3, 22 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court noted that prior to decedent's injury and the vesting of the widow's property right to her cause of action, due process did not forbid the Legislature from creating new causes of action or abolishing old ones. The court held that the widow did not show that the supervisors desired to bring about the decedent's accident or believed that it was certain to flow from their conduct, thus failed to show the requisite &quot;intentional act&quot; under &sect; 23:1032.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court judgment which sustained the supervisor's exception of no cause of action to the widow's petition seeking to recover for the decedent's work-related death, but remanded for the trial court to fix a delay within which the widow could amend her petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parents brought suit against defendants, a superintendent and a school board, seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the superintendent to certify petitions requesting institution of a second language program under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:273. The 31st Judicial District Court for the Parish of Jefferson Davis, Louisiana, made peremptory the alternative writ of mandamus. The superintendent and intervenor board member appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:273 required the institution of second language programs in public schools. It was argued on appeal that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:273 was unconstitutional because it enabled a minority of the families in a school to control the majority of families in the school. In affirming, the court considered the general rule that every statute was presumed to be constitutional. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:273, there was no statutorily mandated requirement for any student to participate in the program once it was instituted. The court held that the statute affected only those persons who chose to be affected and did not deprive the majority of due process. It was also argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it unlawfully delegated legislative power to those petitioning to institute the program. The court disagreed. The court held that the purpose of the petitioning procedures in the statute was to enable a given community with an interest in having a second language program a means by which to compel the school board to exercise such authority and that it was not the act of petitioning which gave the school board the authority to institute the program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, and the costs of the appeal were to be paid by the superintendent and the board member.</SPAN></P>

The employee contended that the extension of immunity to executive officers and co-workers constituted a denial of the equal protection of the law. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that there was no constitutional impediment to the validity of &sect; 23:1032. The court found that the extension of immunity to executive officers and co-workers tended to maintain the integrity and original purpose of the Workmen's Compensation Act.

The court reversed the judgment because the trial judge erroneously assumed that every member of the fire department was assessed for contribution to the fund but that defendants would extend benefits only to certain employees who were &quot;firefighters&quot; within the definition of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2101. The Board's primary duty was to administer the law in accordance with the legislature's intent.

The local federal court had issued an order that children would not be allowed to attend public schools outside of the district wherein the parents were domiciled without its permission. The court held that the local federal district court had exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over the placement of children in public schools outside of their district. The parents had contended that because of the federal doctrine of abstention the federal court would have declined to take jurisdiction since there were unsettled questions of state law involved.

The court affirmed. The court held that the statute was constitutional and did not infringe upon freedom of speech under U.S. Const. amend.

The court rejected the teacher's argument that &sect; 17:640 did not apply to his request to redeposit his contributions to the system, and that the refusal to permit the reentry of those who were physically unable to resume teaching was unconstitutional.

The court affirmed the judgment and held that the judgment would settle issues regarding the legality of the proposed meeting and that the trial court had the authority to grant injunctive relief in situations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff environmental services corporation appealed from the judgment of the Eighteenth Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of Iberville (Louisiana), which upheld the constitutionality of an ordinance of defendant parish police jury. The ordinance prohibited the disposal of hazardous waste within the borders of the parish.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation appealed the district court's decision to uphold the constitutionality of the police jury's ordinance that prohibited the disposal of hazardous waste within the borders of the parish. The court reversed. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1236(31) was not authority for the police jury's action. The state had not delegated its authority in this area but had enacted specific legislation to control the same. In light of the general rules of construction, the court could have come to no other conclusion but that &quot;debris of any kind&quot; was not contemplated by the Legislature in its adoption of the statute to include industrial waste. Applying the same rules and statutory interpretation, the court similarly concluded that the hazardous waste attempted to be regulated by the ordinance was not covered by the term &quot;debris of any kind.&quot; A subordinate political subdivision of the state could not have enacted ordinances that infringed upon the spirit of state law or were repugnant to the general policy of the state. The amending ordinance here contested went even further. It completely abrogated positive state law on the same subject matter. Therefore, it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court was reversed and judgment was rendered that decreed the amending ordinance unconstitutional, null, and without legal effect.All costs as were permitted by law were assessed against the parish police jury.</SPAN></P>

The employee contended that the disease was present at the time of his original examination by the doctor, that he was not informed of its presence, and that his continued diving through the period of the last four years caused the disease to progress past the point of cure. The employee argued that, since the effective date of the statute of prescription was after the examination at which the alleged negligence occurred, the former law of prescription should have applied. The court found that the trial court was correct because the statute of prescription was remedial. The court also found that there was no cause of action against the employer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The levee district filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment that section 33:9005 did not apply to it because it was a multi-taxing parish. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The court held that under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1871, a party was not entitled to declaratory relief unless there was a justiciable controversy. The court stated that justiciable controversy connoted an existing actual and substantial dispute as distinguished from one that was merely hypothetical or abstract. The court concluded that the levee district's allegations were insufficient to establishing a controversy. The court held that the fact that an act of the legislature commanded some action to be taken by an agency, which the agency contended might be unconstitutional, did not without more establish a justiciable controversy to challenge the applicability of the act. The court concluded that the levee district was simply seeking an opinion, which was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

It was contended that because the statute did not provide for judicial review, it was unconstitutional as conflicting with La. Const. Art. V, &sect; 16. The court found that the employees' premise that the statute, by providing that decisions of the board of review were final, precluded judicial review of the board's decisions was erroneous. The Administrative Procedure Act specifically provided that a person who was aggrieved by a final decision or order in an adjudication proceeding was entitled to judicial review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board filed for declaratory and injunctive relief from a decision made by the ethics commission regarding violations that the ethics commission cited against various Board members for doing business with companies holding leases of publicly owned lands upon which the Board acted. The exceptions of no right of action and prematurity were filed by the ethics commission and were sustained by the trial court. On appeal, the court noted that the ethics commission held an investigatory hearing and not a disciplinary hearing; while the commission did not have the authority to investigate and discipline the Board itself, it was not acting ultra vires to investigate individual members. Therefore, the Board had no standing to bring an action against the commission. The court further found that, because the hearing was investigatory and not disciplinary, the exception of prematurity was validly sustained as well. The court therefore affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the action and denial of injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that La. Const. art. I, &sect; 4 providing that private expropriation be allowed only for public and necessary purposes was self executing, and provided limitations on the right to expropriate additional to those required by the legislation. The court found no error in the judgment limiting the servitude granted to the expropriating authority by requiring future encasement if it ever became necessary. The court held that there was a valid remedy in expropriation cases of ordering the needed corrective measures when such claimed injury could be completely relieved. The court also held that arguments concerning the width of the street, the adequacy of the awards for severance damages and attorney's fees were all factual evaluations and fell within the discretion of the trier of fact.</SPAN></P>

The candidate was qualified to run for office, but not for the reasons given by the trial court.

The question of the constitutionality of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 39 would eventually reach the state supreme court, and the court thus refrained from casting aside the statute.&nbsp;La. Civ.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consolidated cases were brought by the property owners who contested certain procedures followed by the parish board of review and tax commission in increasing assessments on vacant land. Plaintiffs petitioned for a writ of mandamus ordering that the city accept payment of real property taxes on the basis of the official tax assessment rolls as submitted to the tax commission by the assessors in the district. The trial court denied the writ, and plaintiffs then sought a declaratory judgment decreeing that the taxes were illegally assessed and illegally collected. Plaintiffs who had paid the taxes assessed and then filed a protest, filed a petition for recovery of taxes under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2110. The trial court dismissed the suit of all plaintiffs who had not paid their taxes. On appeal, the court held that the parish board of review and tax commission complied with the statutory law. The court affirmed the judgment dismissing the suit for declaratory judgment, and reversed the judgment granting relief to the plaintiffs who paid under protest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff father's minor son was injured by a knife left on a shelf by the son's employer. Plaintiff filed suit in tort against defendant insurer, the employer's liability insurer. The reviewing court found that plaintiff could not recover. Plaintiff's sole remedy was through workmen's compensation. An employer's defense of immunity from tort suit was not a personal one under the provisions of La. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court declared defendant an habitual offender under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:1471 et seq. (the Statute) and revoked his driving privileges. The court affirmed. The Statute was not unconstitutional or violative of due process although the hearing under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:1476 did not confer upon the trial judge the discretion to restrict rather than to revoke driving privileges even if the circumstances warranted because neither procedural nor substantive due process required allowance of discretion under the Statute. Defendant was only entitled to notice of the proceedings and a hearing, which the Statute provided. The hearing was appropriate because it gave defendant the chance to disprove the issue of identity and the allegation of prior convictions. The Statute was not arbitrary because it applied equally to all persons and was not unreasonable because the state had a compelling interest to protect the public from danger. The absence of any discretion on the part of the trial judge to restrict driving privileges did not offend due process. Finally, a liberal interpretation of the Statute did not reveal an interpretation that allowed restricted driving privileges.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled otherwise and granted the adoption, accepting the stepfather's argument that, because the birth father was a nonresident, and had failed to support the son, his consent for the adoption was unnecessary under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:422.1(3). The court reversed and held that the birth father was a domiciliary of the state and was not a nonresident as contemplated by &sect; 9:422.1(3), and that the statute did not apply in this case. The stepfather had failed to overcome the presumption of residency; therefore, the birth father's nonresident status was never proven. The birth father was under no court order to support his child. Thus, his consent to adopt was necessary.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held in favor of the widow and the tenants and daughters sought review and asserted that the trial court erred in various respects concerning the decisions as to property interests as well as rulings on evidence at trial. On review, the court reversed the decision insofar as it declared the sales from the decedent to the tenants to be simulations, and ordered a return of one-half of the property sold to the widow. This was after a review of the community interest of the widow. Also, the widow's claim against the daughters was recognized and the case was remanded in this respect as well as for the purpose of determining the amount of land subject to the declaration of homestead.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2334, the district court held that the earnings of the wife while living separate from the husband without a judicial separation, were her separate funds, while the earnings of the husband during the same period were community funds. Each party during this time had paid notes and insurance on the community home. The district court found that under art. 2334, the wife was entitled to a credit for these expenditures, but the husband was not. The district court also awarded to the husband a sum equal to half of the community funds deducted from the wife's salary and placed in her retirement fund under the Federal Employees Retirement System. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that art. 2334 mandated the district court result. The court noted that the constitutionality of art. 2334 had been repeatedly upheld, and that the husband could not raise that issue for the first time in a motion for a new trial, precluding its consideration on appeal. The court declined to rule on the nature of the retirement contributions, finding that the result would be the same whether they were separate or community property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Federal legislation was enacted in order to encourage the states to control outdoor advertising along the interstate and primary highway systems and financial incentives were attached.

The trial court ruled in favor of the department and the advertising company sought review. On appeal, the court first held that the advertising company was unable to utilize the doctrine of equitable estoppel. The court analyzed various constitutional arguments by the advertising company and rejected each in turn. The court then found that the purposes of the statute as expressed in the statute were within the legitimate scope of the police power.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A dispute arose between the board and the taxpayers about the nature of bonds the board proposed to issue for power sales contracts. The board asserted that the bonds were revenue bonds payable from a special fund, the utility receipts of the four cities.

The trial court issued judgment in favor of the board and the taxpayers sought review. On appeal, the court examined the legislation which allowed the financing of public improvements. The court found that, although the proposed facility could very well have been an economical and desirable solution to the member cities' energy problems, the power sales contracts and the proposed bonds were not authorized by La.

On appeal the court held that the method of financing state public purpose projects through public trust authorities formed pursuant to the Louisiana Public Trust Act, La. Rev. Stat.

The court further held that the acceptance of the beneficial interest of the public trust by the governor was authorized by the statute and did not bestow upon the governor the power to make the law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action was based on the motor vehicle habitual offender law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:1472. The driver contended that an additional license suspension, after his driver's license had been suspended for one year and then two years after his second and third convictions respectively, was unconstitutional because it punished him twice for the same acts. The court held that the revocation of his driver's license under the habitual offender statute did not constitute criminal punishment, that it was a civil action and involved only the denial of the privilege of driving a motor vehicle on public highways of the state, and that there was no loss of liberty, no incarceration, and no fine. The court found that the case involved no more than the application of well settled rules of law to a recurring fact situation, that it was not a criminal proceeding, and that double jeopardy did not apply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the district court with costs to the driver in his claim that a license suspension was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiffs, the state attorney general and two state legislators, brought a declaratory action seeking a determination that an ordinance providing for a retirement benefit for criminal and juvenile court judges who were members of the state retirement plan for judges was unconstitutional and seeking an injunction restraining the defendant city from enforcing the ordinance or making the payments authorized thereby. The trial court declared that the ordinance was constitutional and denied injunctive relief. The plaintiffs appealed. In affirming, the court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the city ordinance, which provided for retirement payments for judges, was unconstitutional because it was in contravention of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:691, which prohibited judges from directly or indirectly receiving any additional salary, compensation, emolument, or benefit. The retirement pay allowance provided for in the city ordinance was a benefit in the form of a contribution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant, the child's biological father, appealed the judgment of the trial court (Louisiana) that awarded child support arrearages to the plaintiff, the child's biological mother, arguing that the biological mother lacked the legal capacity to bring suit in the child's behalf where the child had been adopted by an adoptive father.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child's biological mother brought suit against the biological father for child support arrearages. Judgment was entered in favor of the mother, and the biological father appealed, contesting the capacity of the biological mother to bring suit in the child's behalf where the child had been adopted by the adoptive father. In reversing, the court rejected the biological mother's argument that because the judgment for child support was rendered in her favor, she could bring suit in her own right and not as the child's legal representative. The judgment of child support was the property of the child, not the child's parent. Under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 683, the child's father was the proper party to bring a suit to enforce his child's rights. The adoptive father stood in the same position as would a biological father; therefore, the adoptive father, married to and living with the child's mother, was the proper party to enforce the child's right under the judgment of support. Thus, the biological mother lacked capacity. In remanding, the court instructed the trial court to permit an amendment of the pleadings to substitute the adoptive father as the proper plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed, and the matter was remanded to the trial court with instructions to permit an amendment to substitute the adoptive father as the plaintiff and legal representative of the minor child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The designer brought a declaratory action against the state seeking affirmation of the existence of a contract between the designer and the state for the design of a university library. The designer was granted the declaratory judgment and recovered a substantial fee for the design. The trial court refused to allow costs because La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4521 relieves the state of the payment of costs except stenographer's costs. The designer claimed the statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed. The obligation to provide funds to support the state courts was a legislative function. The legislature saw fit to fund the courts by assessing all litigants with costs of court and exempting the state from such costs under the statute. Contrary to the designer's contention La. Const. art. 12, &sect; 10(A) did not limit the legislature's power in that regard. The constitutional provision was intended to abrogate sovereign immunity.

The court affirmed the judgment and the suspension of his license. The court held that the driver's guilty plea to the DWI charge did not prevent the suspension of his license for refusing to the take the chemical test. In addition, the court held that the police officer properly submitted a sworn report attesting to the driver's refusal to take the test. The notary before whom the report was executed testified that he never notarized a report unless the officer appeared before him and either signed the form at that time or affirmed the signature on the form if it had previously been signed. It was unclear whether the officer signed the report in the presence of the notary, but the court held that the report was sworn within the meaning of La. Rev. Stat.

A default judgment was rendered against the state. The state brought an action for a new trial in which it sought to introduce evidence that the signs were located on state owned property, and not on private land as alleged by the billboard owner. The motion was denied. On appeal the court reversed and remanded. The court stated that because no deeds or any other documents were introduced in evidence by the billboard owner that proved his ownership of the tracts of land on which the signs were located, that the billboard owner failed to meet the burden of proof which rested on him to support his demand for a default judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was injured on the job, and he alleged that appellees' negligence caused his injury.

The trial court held that this amendment had retroactive effect. In reversing the judgment, the court held that legislation was presumed to be prospective in effect, unless it was clearly expressed to be retroactive, or was interpretative, remedial, or procedural. The court held that the amendment was not interpretive, but was a change in the law that the legislature deemed necessary. The court further noted that the amendment was far from remedial, as it destroyed the right to file a damage suit, which in appellant's case was a vested property right that could not be taken away without violating U.S. Const. art.

Ann. &sect; 18:396 for filing any objection to one's candidacy, there was a valid federal district court order granting declaratory relief to the first candidate and declaring La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:39&nbsp;unconstitutional. On the day before the third candidate filed the instant suit, a federal appeals court ordered the previous district court order stayed. The first candidate resigned as judge the following day. The court held that the third candidate's suit was timely. Nevertheless, the court held that the first candidate was not disqualified because the effect of the disqualifying statute had been suspended. The first candidate's resignation as a judge on the day after the statute regained its validity as a result of the federal appellate court order was timely under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband of the decedent brought suit for a declaratory judgment against defendants. He alleged that the decedent was not divorced from either of her two former husbands and was not capable of contracting a valid marriage with him. He alleged no knowledge of this incapacity until after the death of decedent, and thus contended that under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 118, defendants were not entitled to the civil effects of the marriage. The husband contended that defendants had no rights of ownership in any of the property acquired during the existence the marriage. Defendants answered denying the nullity of the marriage and sought to show that their mother was a good faith putative wife entitled to the civil effects of the marriage. The district court held that decedent was in a bad faith marriage, because her previous two husbands were living and neither was divorced from decedent at the time of the marriage to the husband. Defendants appealed. The court affirmed, stating that decedent's rights as a bad faith wife precluded lawful transfer of property transferred to decedent as a wife and those claiming an interest through her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association consisted of milk producers. Each member had the right to sell the association a certain daily amount of milk. This right was called a &quot;base.&quot; Two years after the member joined, an amendment to a bylaw was passed requiring that a certain form be used and that the association give approval if a member sold his base. The member claimed that the amended bylaw was being given retroactive effect that unconstitutionally impaired his vested &quot;property&quot; right to transfer his base under the less restrictive bylaw in effect when he joined. The court found that the bylaw was not retroactively applied because it was only applied to base sales that occurred after the amendment was passed. Although his property right to sell his base was created before the amendment, the member had not attempted to exercise this right until after. The member's rights were subject to the greater power of the association to modify the rights created by the membership. Even if the bylaw was retroactively applied, that did not mean that it was unconstitutional because the association did not repudiate or destroy the base or deny members a means of exercising the right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sought $ 4 million in damages against defendants. In response to defendants' plea of prematurity, plaintiff asserted that the medical panel procedure provided by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.47 was unconstitutional under La. Const. art. 5, &sect; 1. Plaintiff also challenged the constitutionality of the statute's damage limitation. The Attorney General contended that his motion to be made a party should have been granted because the case involved an issue as to the constitutionality of a state statute. On reconsideration of the denial of the motion, the court held that the presiding judge had correctly refused to order that the Attorney General be made a party. The court stated that La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1880 required the citation of the Attorney General only in declaratory judgment actions seeking a declaration of the unconstitutionality of a state statute. The court stated that art. 1880 was inapplicable because plaintiff sought only a money judgment, not declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former lot owners and several of their neighbors instituted an action to have an ordinance, which rezoned a city lot, decreed to be invalid. The current lot owner intervened in the action. After judgment was rendered nullifying and abrogating the ordinance, the zoning commission and the current lot owner sought review. On appeal, the court examined whether the rezoning ordinance sought to be annulled was invalid as constituting illegal &quot;spot&quot; zoning, and whether the governing authority acted arbitrarily or unreasonably in making that zoning change. The court found that the ordinance merely changed the zoning classification of the lot to conform to the area that abutted it and that the action taken by the city and the zoning commission did not constitute illegal spot zoning. The court found no merit to the former lot owners' argument that the action of the zoning commission in changing the classification of the lot was arbitrary, unreasonable, and discriminatory because there were cogent and understandable reasons for the change given the nature of the surrounding properties. The court concluded that the zoning classification was valid.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the director of personnel's suit for a writ of mandamus compelling the School Board to grant the leave and held that the School Board had, and did not abuse, the discretion to determine which employees were and were not members of the teaching staff. On appeal, the court reversed. The court noted that the director of personnel held a teacher's certificate and that the School Board required him to hold a teacher's certificate as a qualification for employment in that position. The court held that the term &quot;member of the teaching staff&quot; as used in &sect; 17:1171 included employees who held a teacher's certificate, whose employment required a teacher's certificate, and whose duties related to teaching and teachers. Therefore, the director of personnel was eligible for sabbatical leave.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an unsuccessful attempt to enjoin defendant school board from enforcing a resolution against him, plaintiff principal complained of the judgment of the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo, Louisiana, which rejected his demands for monetary damage against defendant school board, founded upon his alleged loss of income and other fringe benefits, mental anguish, and injury to his professional reputation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board granted the principal a sabbatical for the school year so he could attend an accredited college for the six graduate credit hours. He also obtained employment with a Wyoming school district to serve as principal of a large high school for that year. The Board by resolution notified the principal that his Wyoming employment had to be discontinued or his sabbatical would be terminated. The court held that the lower court correctly found that the principal misrepresented his intention to the board the purpose for which he intended to spend the requested sabbatical. Full and truthful disclosure was not made to the board and the board was within its authority in taking the action complained of. Also the principal was an employee of the board at all time while on sabbatical, subject to the employer's reasonable control. His continued entitlement to sabbatical was dissipated by his own misrepresentation to his employer, and his right thereto was not indefinitely vested. The court found that any restraint on the principal's employment in Wyoming was not unreasonable in view of the Louisiana Sabbatical Leave Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:1177.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court adopted the excellent detailed opinion of the lower court and affirmed the judgment below denying the principal the damages he sought.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife entered into an antenuptial contract in which they agreed that there would be no community of acquets and gains during the marriage, and the wife expressly waived all claims for alimony. The husband contended the antenuptial contract was drawn in strict compliance with the provisions of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2325, et seq. regarding marriage contracts, and that the waiver by the wife in that contract of any claim for alimony following a judicial separation is not against public policy and is a valid and binding agreement. The wife relied on La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 119, which provided with reference to the duties of married persons that the husband and wife owe to each other mutually, fidelity, support and assistance, and contended that her waiver of alimony was an absolute nullity because it was against public policy. The court held that the wife's waiver of her right to alimony pendente lite constituted a relative nullity stemming from an act in derogation of laws enacted for her protection and was not in violation of public order or good morals, and her antenuptial contract was valid and not against public policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner placed two mobile homes on his real property, which was subject to a zoning ordinance that prohibited house trailers. The neighbors brought an action for injunctive relief against the landowner. The landowner filed only a general denial until the day of trial, at which time he filed an exception challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance. During trial, without amendment of the pleadings, the landowner attempted to prove a nonconforming use of the premises. The trial court concluded the ordinance was not unconstitutional, disallowed the landowner's proof of nonconforming use, and rendered judgment for the neighbors. The court held that the ordinance did not violate the enabling act that gave it authority and was thus not unconstitutional. The court held that a nonconforming use was the sort of affirmative defense contemplated by La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1005, and because the landowner had not specifically pleaded it, could not be asserted. The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the neighbors and against the landowner.</SPAN></P>

One year later, the father filed suit for divorce and for change of custody of the children. The trial court granted the divorce, but awarded the permanent custody of the children to the mother. In affirming the trial court's decision, the court held that the fact that the mother had engaged in an adulterous relationship with another man since the separation did not per se render her morally unfit as a mother. The court held that there was nothing else in the record to indicate that the mother was in any way unfit to care for her children. The court refused to consider the father's constitutional attack on the maternal preference rule established by La. Civ.

The road connected property leased by the resident with a blacktop parish road. The court concluded that the trial court erred in finding that an authentic act of dedication, which occurred more than 40 years prior to the instant action, dedicated the disputed portion of the road. The court found that such portion was not included in the public act of dedication because the disputed portion did not exist when the remainder of the road was dedicated. The court, however, affirmed the judgment after concluding that the trial court correctly found that the road was a public road by reason of maintenance by the police jury for more than three years and that there was a tacit dedication under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:491. The court also held that the trial court properly overruled defendants' exception of unconstitutionality. The court held that &sect; 48:491, interpreted as applying only where the landowner had knowledge of and acquiesced in maintenance of a road by the public authority and interpreted as not applying where the landowner opposed such maintenance, was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The state legislature passed a law allowing the school board to swap the tract for another. The school board alleged that the exchange of property was illegal and unconstitutional because it was in fact a sale. The trial court granted the city and park association's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the suit. On appeal the court found that the transaction authorized by the state legislature was an exchange that was in keeping with the spirit of the donation of the original tract. The court held that because the transaction was an exchange of lands for governmental purposes, La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 12 (1921) did not apply. The court found that the prohibition against granting state property did not prohibit the state from changing the destination of particular public property or from instrusting the administration of such property to the municipal corporation where the property was located.

The court affirmed. Specifically, the court determined that the 15th Judicial District could entertain jurisdiction of proceedings under the Motor Vehicle Habitual Offender Law because it had general jurisdiction in both civil and criminal matters. Furthermore, the court found that because defendant had made a general appearance in the criminal action, the district court had the discretion to refuse to grant a judgment of dismissal except with prejudice under La.

The patient's attorney waived her appearance at the hearing, and did not secure the appearance of any witnesses or an independent examination, but challenged the constitutionality of La. Rev Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This was an appeal from the decision of the 26th Judicial District for the Parish of Webster (Louisiana). Appellee stepfather of a four-year-old child sought to adopt the child without the consent of appellant natural father under the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:422.1. The adoption was opposed by the child's natural father. The district court granted the adoption and the natural father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court granted the petition of the stepfather of a four-year-old child to adopt the child without the consent of her natural father and the natural father appealed. The court affirmed. The natural father's explanation that his failed payments were based upon an agreement with his former wife was totally without merit. His argument that he was financially unable to make child support payments was likewise without merit. The court carefully considered each of his arguments on the unconstitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:422.1 and found no basis for them, either under the constitutional provisions cited or in the jurisprudence. The natural father's contention that the adoption statute violated the constitutional prohibition against abolishment of forced heirship was also without merit. His final contention was that the statute was unconstitutional for the reason that it deprived him of his parental rights without due process. However, the adoption law clearly met the requirements of due process. The natural father was served a copy of the petition and given every opportunity to oppose it. There was no showing made that he was denied due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parish jury, after receiving verified petitions containing the signatures of more than 25 per cent of the qualified electors of two different wards, passed a resolution which called for local option elections in both wards.

The propositions involved whether the manufacturing or selling of alcoholic beverages would be permitted in either of the two wards. The election was held and the majority of the electors voted that the manufacturing or selling of alcoholic beverages would not be permitted in either of the two wards. The parish jury then adopted two ordinances that prohibited the manufacturing or selling of several alcoholic beverages in both wards. The business owners were notified by the sheriff that the ordinances would be enforced. The business owners brought an action for injunctive relief and to nullify and void the ordinances. The lower court rejected the action for injunctive relief. On appeal the court affirmed. The court held that the elections were valid under La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient brought her strict liability and negligence action against the hospital, its insurer, and the blood bank after she contracted serum hepatitis from a blood transfusion. Affirming the trial court's dismissal of the strict liability and breach of warranty claims, the court held that art. 1764(B) was not unconstitutional because it was not arbitrary or capricious. The court found that the legislature had a legitimate interest in insuring that blood products were available for transfusions, that the immunity provision of art. 1764(B) furthered that interest, and that the detriment to the patient did not outweigh the benefits, which art. 1764(B) was intended to promote. Although the protection provided to consumers by express and implied warranties was not available to the patient, she was not barred from pursuing her action in negligence. If the hospital or blood bank failed to meet the standard of care required in the handling of the blood, the patient had the right to recover damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police jury called a special election with a proposition to permit the sale of low and high content alcoholic beverages. When the police jury became aware that the election date did not comply with La. R.S. 26:586, the election was rescheduled. Following the election on the new date, the taxpayers brought suit contending that the election ordinances were null and void. They claimed: (1) The change in date did not comply with La. R.S. 26:586; (2) The rescheduled election date did not allow time for absentee balloting under La. R.S. 18:1071; (3) Failure of the police jury to furnish commissioners separate lists of voters; (4) The city did not call a local option election; (5) The police jury was without authority within incorporated municipal limits; and (6) The election was an unconstitutional under La. Const. Art. 3, &sect; 1 (1974). The court rejected these arguments on appeal and held that the ordinance adopted prohibiting the sale of low alcoholic content was legal and binding.

While plaintiff was being booked, a small pill box containing a Mebaral tablet was found among his possessions.

In the criminal trial that followed, the state proved a prima facie case against plaintiff, but the criminal court granted a directed verdict to plaintiff because he proved to the satisfaction of the judge that he was legally in possession of the Mebaral. In agreeing with the dismissal of plaintiff's claim of false arrest, the court found that the trooper had &quot;reasonable cause&quot; to believe that plaintiff had violated La. Rev. Stat.

With respect to the malicious prosecution action against the district attorney, it was clear that there was probable cause for prosecution because the state proved a prima facie case and no malice was shown.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Parish vice squad detectives armed with a search warrant, confiscated numerous magazines, books, movies and artificial apparatus used in various sexual activities from the store. The parish then sought and was granted a permanent injunction against the store. The store sought review, arguing that the trial court erred in overruling an exception of no cause and/or right of action, in basing injunctive relief on illegally seized evidence, and in issuing an injunction which did not describe in reasonable detail the material which was prohibited from being sold, displayed, distributed, or exhibited. On appeal, the court amended the injunction to make it more specific and affirmed the judgment. The court held that the material displayed by and sold by the store fell within the definition of obscenity in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106 because they amounted to hard core sexual conduct. The court ruled that obscenity was a form of expression not protected by the First Amendment.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4711, et seq., in plaintiff State of Louisiana's action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought a judgment enjoining the owner from carrying on and conducting prostitution on certain premises, and an order of abatement directing the effectual closing of the buildings and structures in which those activities were being conducted. The owner resisted the action, contending primarily that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4711, et seq., was void and unconstitutional, in that its provisions were so vague and indefinite that they had not given adequate notice of what action had to be taken in order to avoid the issuance of an injunction or an order of abatement. The owner further contended that the cited statute violated the due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 (1974). The lower court issued a permanent injunction and order of abatement against the owner and he sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment on the grounds that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4711, et seq., referred to the class of persons who were not conducting the nuisances described but who were knowingly permitting them to exist. The court held that La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The telephone company applied for a permit to allow it to build a parking lot and add a second floor to its building, which was located in a residential neighborhood.

The court held that the city counsel was authorized under its zoning laws to permit the telephone company a special exemption. The court also determined that the city counsel's decision to allow the parking lot was not void on the grounds that it constituted illegal spot zoning, because the property in question, was located on a busy thoroughfare, across the street from a fire station, and a large portion of which was presently being used as a telephone exchange. The court stated that it was reasonably susceptible to the proposed expansion and development of the area. The court upheld the counsel's grant of the permit and denied the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied the taxpayer judicial review of this considerable assessment increase on an exception of no right of action because it failed to file a sworn list, and concluded that a La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2110 contest was limited to questioning the constitutionality of the tax itself and not an unconstitutional administration of the assessment law. The court held, however, that &sect; 47:2110 created a right not only to test the constitutionality of the law but also to question the method of administering a valid law. If the taxpayer proved his tax burden was onerous due either to an invalid law or unequal enforcement of a valid levy, there was a deprivation of property without due process of law. The court disagreed with the commission's contention that this case was governed by the pre-amendment limitation that the right of action existed except in so far as such rights elsewhere provided may be in conflict with it. That the tax liability arose prior to the amendment did not place the taxpayer under the pre-amendment statute. The amended law controlled, and a sworn list was not a condition precedent to filing suit under &sect; 47:2110, as amended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment appealed from, overruled and the exceptions of no right of action and res judicata, and remanded this matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 13:1569, subd. 15(b), (c), and (d) and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1570, subd. A(3) were constitutional. The language of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1569, subd. 15(b), (c), and (d), was not vague on its face as to deny a CINS due process of law. Further, a CINS child was not being adjudicated a criminal and placed in a facility as a punitive measure. The object of the CINS statute was to provide rehabilitation and treatment for juveniles who engaged in prescribed conduct. Although marginal cases could be placed where doubts might arise, that was no basis to strike down the statute for vagueness. A reading of the statute indicated the intent to provide for judicial supervision of a certain class of children who were engaging in conduct which was detrimental to their well-being in lieu of affixing the stigma of delinquency on such children. Also, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1574 required a specific pleading of the facts which brought the child within the purview of the provisions of Chapter 6 of the Revised Statutes. Additional procedural safeguards were also provided.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, holding that certain Louisiana statutes in juvenile proceedings which pertained to a &quot;child in need of supervision&quot; were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being employed for about eight years, the employee was discharged because of violations of department regulations concerning moustaches and hair and for insubordination or discourtesy to a superior. The employee's immediate superior, on about 20 separate occasions, had required several firemen to trim their moustaches to bring them to regulation. The employee lost his temper, used profanity, said he was tired of being &quot;picked on&quot; and discriminated against, and said he was not going to cut his &quot;g -- d --- moustache&quot; and, referring to his supervisor, threatened to whip a portion of the &quot;s.o.b.'s&quot; anatomy. The employee contended discriminatory and arbitrary application of the regulation toward him. The court held that the record did not support that contention, but was to the contrary. Testimony on this point included statements to the effect that a long moustache would affect the face piece of a gas mask and keep it from adhering to the skin, and the hair would not let it lock in safely and it would let poisonous gas in.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bookmakers challenged the trial court's judgment banning them from a local privately-owned racetrack. The bookmakers had been previously convicted of conspiracy to commit illegal gambling, i.e., bookmaking on football games under 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1955, causing track stewards to evict them from the racetrack. After the bookmakers filed suit, track stewards sent them notice of an administrative hearing to decide their status, but the bookmakers, responding through their attorney, refused to attend. The stewards ruled them off in absentia. On appeal, the court held that horse racing in Louisiana was a highly-regulated sport and that the State Racing Commission (Commission) had authority under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 172(D) to make rules ejecting &quot;objectionable persons&quot; from racetrack premises. The bookmakers' civil rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000a et seq., and La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 12 (1974) were not violated because excluding felons convicted of gambling crimes from racetracks was not arbitrary or capricious.

The tortfeasor punched the sheriff's deputy in the face when the deputy was attempting to arrest the suspect, following the suspect's refusal to produce identification upon request.

The court ruled that the deputy had a reasonable suspicion that the suspect had committed a crime and was lawfully entitled to question him.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers sought and obtained a preliminary injunction that enjoined the tax commission from ordering the assessors of the Second Municipal District and the Third Municipal District of the City of New Orleans to amend the 1976 tax rolls to increase assessments on vacant property. The taxpayers maintained that the tax commission violated the law in establishing the tax assessments. On appeal, the court annulled the trial court's judgment. The court ruled that the taxpayers were not entitled to injunctive relief regardless of whether their claims of illegality had merit. The court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2110 prohibited the trial court from enjoining the collection of taxes or the enforcement of any provision of the tax law. The court noted that the reason for prohibiting the use of the injunctive process to restrain the collection of taxes levied or any law in connection therewith was obvious - there would be no funds to pay for government services if taxpayers could enjoin taxing authorities.</SPAN></P>

Having been promulgated prior to the opening of the qualification period, there was no violation of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 4. There was no denial of due process because there was no act contrary to law.

On appeal, the driver contended that &sect; 32:667 required that a test be valid for a suspension to result from its refusal, and that because the Department had not set up or approved any methods for administering the test, the test he refused was not valid. The court held that because the test proposed was to be given prior to December 20, 1975, the date the rules for testing were promulgated, the test was not valid, and therefore the Department could not suspend the driver's license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This was a tax refund suit brought by the company against the collector of revenue, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat.

The inclusion of out-of-state labor, shop overhead and transportation costs in assessing a use tax on an out-of-state manufacturer-user was violative of U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, cl. 3 when an in-state manufacturer-user pays tax (sales) on material costs only. Finding that the use tax was imposed upon labor and shop overhead of the out of state manufacturer-user and that neither sales nor use tax was imposed upon the in-state manufacturer-user, the court was constrained to conclude that the Louisiana Use Tax as applied to labor and shop overhead of the out of state manufacturer-user was unconstitutional and therefore unenforceable, because it was violative of the commerce clause. The collector argued that the summary judgment was improper as there was a material issue of fact, but after an examination of depositions and answers, no material issue of fact was found to exist.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the lower court was affirmed insofar as it granted judgment against the collector and denied the reconventional demand. The collector was assessed with the costs permitted by law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sanitary board filed an action against the cattle owner, seeking a mandatory injunction compelling him to pen his cattle for identification and brucellosis re-testing.

The district court dismissed the action, holding that the sanitary board failed to carry its burden of proving brucellosis infection in the cattle owner's livestock.

Because no proper foundation had been laid to receive the business records, the commission barn's records were inadmissible. The court ruled that the sanitary board failed to demonstrate that the livestock was the cattle owner's.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' negligence action against defendants stemmed from two pints of blood transfused into plaintiff wife. The trial court dismissed their complaint. On appeal the court held that the trial court properly denied relief where plaintiffs failed to prove that the wife's hepatitis was contracted from the blood transfusions at issue. Further, there was no actionable breach of duty on the part of any of defendants, and no negligence on their part was displayed in the record. Plaintiffs' contention that La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1764B was unconstitutional, where it specifically excluded all implied warranties in the sale of blood, had no merit. The legislature validly regulated causes of action of this type and the immunity privilege operated equally and fairly to those who engaged in like transactions and affected all persons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department sought to acquire part of the owner's property to build a bridge and realign a segment of a state highway. The trial court signed an order allowing full ownership of the land upon the deposit of the estimated just compensation in accord with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. art. 48:441-460, the state's quick taking statute. The owner appealed the trial court's denial of its motion to dismiss and vacate the order. The court held: (1) the quick taking provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. art. 48:441 did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment or La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 4 (1974) because the Fourteenth Amendment did not require a hearing on the necessity and expediency of a taking where the intended use was public, the taking could precede ascertainment of just compensation so long as payment was reasonably prompt, and La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 4 (1974) did not require payment of compensation before a taking could occur; (2) the Department had discretion to determine whether to take the land in fee or to merely acquire a servitude; and (3) the uniform policy of the Department was to expropriate in fee for highway construction so it could install utilities without undue delay.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs taxpayers appealed an order of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) dismissing the action filed against defendant State of Louisiana which sought a declaration that 1975 La. Acts 719 was unconstitutional. The Act provided for the allocation and distribution of the Revenue Sharing Fund. The taxpayers alleged that the Act denied equal protection of the law to certain parishes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Louisiana Constitution provided exemption for state, parish, and local taxes for the homestead of certain head of households. The Property Tax Relief Fund was created to distribute funds among the various parishes based on the losses incurred due to the homestead exemption. Later, the Revenue Sharing Fund was created to distribute funds to the parishes. The taxpayers argued that the parish was only reimbursed 87 percent of the revenues it lost under the homestead exemption. It argued that the Act failed to reimburse revenue losses attributable to the homestead exemptions in full and denied them equal protection of the law. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court found that the extent of reimbursement of homestead exemptions was irrelevant, as long there was a uniform system of assessment. The formula based revenue distribution on weighted percentages of population and the number of homesteads within each parish. The taxpayers were treated in a manner consistent with other parishes and the formula furthered a legitimate state interest and was rationally related to the furtherance of those interests. The taxes were not invalidated and the Act did not impair contracts.</SPAN></P>

She had tried to obtain a sabbatical leave, and was ultimately granted a sick leave of absence until the end of the school term. Thereafter she made a demand for her salary during the period she was ill and on sick leave, beyond her accumulated sick leave. The parish school bard denied payment, and she filed suit for her salary. The trial court found for the teacher and the parish school board appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed, citing La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:1201, and :1202, which provide that she was entitled to her salary minus any actual cost of hiring a substitute. The school board contended that the statute was unconstitutional under La. Const. art IV, &sect; 12, because she had not actually worked. The court held that this argument was without merit because the pay was a fringe benefit. The court finally held that the parish school board could not reduce her pay below that left after the hiring of a substitute, and affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen filed an action asserting that the Louisiana Election Campaign Finance Disclosure Act, La. Rev. Stat.

I, and that the legislation usurped powers vested in other branches of government pursuant to La. Const. art. II. The trial court rejected the contentions of invalidity and the citizen appealed. On appeal, the court found that this legislation required strict rules and penalties concerning campaign contributions. The court found that the citizen had a right to participate in the political process through the utilization of property as well as through his vote, and that this was a legally protectable interest. Therefore, he had standing to contest the validity of the disclosure provisions. The court noted that the legislative appointment of the reporting officials and supervisory committees under the legislation was invalid. Further, the remainder of the legislation could not reasonably function without the offending provisions. The court therefore declared the legislation null and ruled that the enforcement of its provisions was prohibited and enjoined.</SPAN></P>

The attorney breached his standard of care by failing to recognize the possible invalidity of the hospital's alleged lien. However, the client had a natural obligation under La. Civ.

The driver was notified by the department of public safety that his driver's license was suspended for a period of one year. An administrative hearing was requested. After the hearing, the suspension was affirmed. The proceeding for judicial review was filed by the driver. Judgment was signed affirming the action of the department of public safety. The driver challenged the decision, and the court agreed with the trial court. The driver alleged that the trial court was in error. He argued the La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:414, under which his license was suspended, required that he be convicted as a second offender before his license could be suspended for one year. The contention was without merit. The statute only required that he be convicted of the offense twice, not that he be convicted as a second offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When plaintiff's plea for an injunction, prohibiting the airport district from removing him from his position as member of the Commission was denied, he amended his petition and sought a declaratory judgment relative to his qualifications to hold the position on the Commission and alternatively asked to be reinstated to his former position. The trial court again denied him relief and dismissed his action. In its affirmance, the court held that the right to be considered for appointive public office is not a fundamental right under the U.S. Const. amend. XIV.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant retailer sought review of denial of his demand for an injunction against appellee parish police jury in the Third Judicial District Court for the Parish of Lincoln (Louisiana). He argued that the 1974 legislature required four propositions to be placed on the ballot in local option elections under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:587, making the election and resulting ordinances ultra vires because only three propositions were included.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to the effective date of the ordinance prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages containing more than 3.2 percent alcohol by weight in Ward One, the retailer held licenses to sell such beverages. After the ordinances passed, he demand an injunction to enjoin the enforcement of, and to declare unconstitutional, these ordinances, which were adopted by the parish police jury pursuant to a local option election. The trial court denied relief to the retailer, and he appealed. The court held that the petitions presented to the jury before the effective date of the 1974 legislation were in accord with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:583 and were also in accord with Act 41 of 1974, before or after the decision in Nomey v. State, 315 So.2d 709 (La. 1975). This parish was not one of the 12 parishes in which the 3.2 fourth proposition was required to be on the petition. The call of the election by the police jury and the ballot were also in accord with &sect; 26:587. As the retailer asserted no position of reliance on the statute, he was not entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city appealed from the judgment of the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo (Louisiana) that overturned the civil service board decision and decreed that termination of plaintiff's employment was erroneous and illegal, and ordered plaintiff reinstated with full back pay and benefits in a wrongful discharge action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">City regulations made declaration of bankruptcy sufficient grounds for discharge from employment. The court affirmed the district court's ruling in favor of plaintiff fireman. The city regulations had a laudable purpose of preventing the public from fearing theft by poor firefighters that would loot their homes, but the effect of the regulation was to discourage and penalize people from exercising rights created by federal statute. Regardless of how laudable the regulations, the regulations violated the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. There was no error in awarding full back pay without consideration of mitigation by plaintiff in obtaining work at other jobs. Defendant city failed to provide citations allowing reduction in backpay awards for mitigation, and recovery of back pay was never classified as damages to which mitigation applied. Further, plaintiff had that job before filing for bankruptcy and there was no evidence of earnings in excess of what plaintiff made prior to discharge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The determination of the district court that discharge of plaintiff was illegal and ordering reinstatement with full backpay and benefits was affirmed because the city regulation allowing discharge violated the Supremacy Clause in the United States Constitution, and backpay was not subject to mitigation. The remaining issues were not reached.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents filed suit against the school board and its insurer for damages for the wrongful death of their minor son who was killed when he was struck by a school bus operated by an employee of defendant school board. In their petition, the parents requested a jury trial. The trial court sustained a motion by the school board to strike the parent's demand for a jury trial, and the parents appealed, claiming that while the school board could be exempted from a jury trial by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5104, the insurer could not, because it was not a political subdivision of the state. The court affirmed, holding that while a jury could determine the issues as they affected the individual non-state litigants, and the judge would determine all other state-related issues, the issues had to be clearly distinguishable as between the individual litigants and the governmental bodies to allow submission of the non-state issues to a jury. The issues in the instant action were not clearly distinguishable, and thus a jury trial was not proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a decision in favor of a building and loan and a commissioner of financial institutions, the court affirmed, holding that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6:852(C) did not require the commissioner to hold a hearing before approving an application to establish a branch office. A savings and loan had brought an action seeking to annul the commissioner's approval of an application by a building and loan to locate a branch in a municipality. The court held that the commissioner was not required to comply with the Louisiana Administrative Procedures Act (APA), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:951 et seq. The court held that the APA applied only in cases where a hearing was presently provided for by law. It did not create the right to a hearing where none was presently required. The court held that the savings and loan, which brought the action, did not have a vested interest in the banking business of their area, and held no exclusive franchise. Further, the commissioner complied with the statutory and constitutional requirements of state and federal law. The court determined that La. Rev. Stat.

The owner contended that the reassessment scheme violated the constitutional principles of equal protection and uniformity in taxation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City undertook a program to reassess property values. The program was executed in a haphazard fashion by the several assessors of the five tax districts. The court held that the arbitrary manner in which the reassessments progressed violated the federal and Louisiana constitutional guarantees of equal protection, U.S. Const. amend. XIV and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 (1921), as well as the guarantee of uniformity in taxation contained in La. Const. art. X, &sect; 1. The court acknowledged that a program of reassessment, for example a cyclical reassessment, that was carried out systematically so that a substantially equal amount of taxable property was revalued in each year of the cyclical program was constitutional. But the court found nothing systematic in the piecemeal reassessment that affected the property owner. The court also held that the City exceeded its authority in embarking on the program. The court noted the nonjoinder of the tax collector, who was an indispensable party pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2110 and La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 641, and held that this doomed the owner's refund action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court annulled the judgment insofar as it declared the reassessment program constitutional and the assessment levied against the owner valid, and affirmed the dismissal of the owner's refund action.</SPAN></P>
