The court found that the Texas Tort Claims Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6252-19 (1970), which waived petitioner's immunity from tort liability, could be reconciled with Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 59(c), which prohibited the incurring of indebtedness against a reclamation district unless approved by the voters. The court held that the legislature acted within its constitutional authority in providing for the limited waiver of immunity. The court also held that judgments obtained in accordance with the Act were payable from maintenance taxes levied in accordance with Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 59(c) because the authority to use maintenance taxes covered any expenses or debts incidental to maintenance and operations. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment because the negligence of petitioner's employee was incidental to maintenance activities and operations and respondent was entitled to collect the judgment from maintenance funds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator attorney and his client sought a writ of mandamus to compel respondent judge to grant a legislative continuance of certain post-judgment motions filed in December of 1974 and January of 1975 relating to the enforcement of a judgment entered by respondent on December 28, 1973, in the Harris County Court of Domestic Relations Number Two (Texas).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a divorce decree relator wife was awarded $ 300,000 to establish a new residence within a year. She was permitted to live in the marital residence, which was awarded to her husband until such time. Relator wife failed to vacate premises as required and husband filed a motion for contempt. Relator attorney filed a motion of substitution of attorneys along with a motion to stay prior orders regarding prior $ 300,000 judgment and possession of the marital home. Respondent judge set hearing for January 2, 1975 and respondents filed a motion for continuance until 30 days after the adjournment of the 64th session of the legislature, based upon Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2168a. Relators' motion was overruled and a hearing on all issues was set. A writ of mandamus was sought. The court found that relator attorney was hired after the final judgment of the divorce and that the motion to stay and for continuance were not ancillary matters to a pending suit. The petition for mandamus on those matters was denied. The contempt matter was filed after relator attorney was hired, and under art. 2168a, respondent was required to give him a continuance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that relator attorney and his client were entitled to a writ of mandamus delaying hearing on contempt, but the motion to stay and for continuance were not subject to legislative delay because they were not ancillary matters of a pending suit, as the judgment it was related to was final. The continuance did not deprive husband of any property rights and the relators' petition was granted on the contempt matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, Railroad Commission of Texas, sought review of the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals (Texas), which affirmed the trial court's ruling that petitioner had the power, jurisdiction, and duty under the Cox Act to determine title and rights to gas under respondents, cities and utility companies', contracts, and to promulgate rules to set aside contracts under which gas reserves, or rights to gas, were sold.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the energy crisis of the mid-1970's, respondents, cities and gas utility companies, requested petitioner, state railroad commission, to suspend the delivery of gas owned by a gathering company and to reallocate the gas which had been sold or assigned under contract. Petitioner declined and respondents brought suit. The trial court held, and the court of appeals affirmed, that petitioner had the power, jurisdiction, and duty under the Cox Act to go behind the contracts and that by necessary implication petitioner had the power to allocate the supply of gas regardless of who owned the gas. Thereafter, petitioner sought review. On review, the court reversed, holding that under the Act, petitioner did have the authority to allocate gas even if it the allocation affected a utility companies' contractual quantities but only in view of allocating gas based on statewide public interest and only if the gas was owned by utility companies. The court further held that petitioner only had the powers expressly delegated to it and that it did not have the express authority to void contracts, suspend gas delivery, or determine who owned title to gas.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the appeals court affirmed summary judgment for respondent doctor on petitioner patient's malpractice claim, petitioner appealed. The court reversed and remanded the case for trial holding that petitioner had pleaded a cause of action to recover for the treatment and care of a child with birth defects. The alleged negligence of respondent rested on his failure to make reasonable disclosure of petitioner's diagnosis with rubella and the risk of the proposed treatment, and, even though abortion was illegal in Texas at that time, respondent would not have been guilty as an accomplice to any abortion subsequently obtained by petitioner if he merely disclosed the information without advising petitioner to obtain an abortion. However, the court held that petitioner was only entitled to recover for damages relating to the treatment and care of the child and could not recover for damages due solely to the existence of life.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found for respondent and the intermediate appellate court affirmed. Under the Municipal Annexation Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 970a, the extension of any town or city was limited to contiguous and adjacent areas. By way of the ordinance challenged by petitioner, respondent attempted to annex a strip of land, which it neither owned, nor was it within its extraterritorial jurisdiction. Respondent contended that a general validating statute validated its action. The court concluded that in passing the general validating statute, the legislature did not intend to validate the annexation of noncontiguous or nonadjacent territory. The court also held that that territory within the exclusive extraterritorial jurisdiction of one city was not adjacent to any other city, as a matter of law. The court therefore held that respondent's ordinance was void because it violated the Act, and the general validation statute could not validate it. The court reversed the judgments of the lower courts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee board filed suit to collect assessments that appellant processor should have collected under the Texas Commodity Referendum Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 55(c). Appellant principal stockholder intervened and appellants filed a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment that the Act was unconstitutional and a permanent injunction restraining appellee from collecting assessments. When the trial court denied the counterclaim and awarded appellee $ 4,644.02 in back assessments, appellants sought review. The court decided that the assessments were not special assessments because they were not levied on land, did not purport to be based on benefits to property, and were not made to pay for public improvements. Because the assessments were intended to raise revenue, they were taxes. The court found the assessment to be an occupation tax on an agricultural pursuit within the meaning of Tex. Const. art.

Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15 (the Act). Relator contended that Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 725b applied the law in effect at the time of defendants' trial, which provided for a minimum of two years imprisonment. The court held that contrary to the trial court's determination; the Act did not apply to those convicted of an offense committed before the Act's effective date. Thus, the minimum sentence that could be imposed on defendants was two years imprisonment as authorized under Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 725b. However, because the trial court revoked defendants' probation prior to resentencing them, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 42.12 required that their sentence be no less than the minimum prescribed for the offense for which they were convicted, two years imprisonment.

Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 46.02 and 46.03 against appellee and its employees. The court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The court held that its appellate jurisdiction was restricted to appeals from intermediate courts of civil appeals. A limited exception in Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 3-b and Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1738a provided for direct appeals of trial court orders granting or denying an injunction on constitutional grounds relating to any state statute or the validity of any agency administrative order. The court held that relief was originally sought in the trial court primarily on the ground that the statute did not apply to appellee's operating personnel or that its application to appellee would have been unconstitutional. The trial court had made no holding on either question. The temporary injunctive relief was not granted or denied on the ground that the statute was constitutional or unconstitutional, and hence the court had no jurisdiction to hear a direct appeal from the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>

III, &sect;&sect; 35, 55, 56, Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 1, 2, and equal protection principles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were lawyers, insurance agents, and others who had previously written bail bonds. Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2372p-3 required generally that bail bondsmen be licensed, subject to certain exemptions, including one for persons executing bonds in counties having a population of less than 150,000. The court rebuffed each challenge to the constitutionality of the statute, and affirmed the judgment. The statute did not violate Tex. Const. art. II, &sect; 35, in that the caption of the legislative act did not express more than one subject in its title. The several matters referred to in the act were sufficiently related to one general subject to pass muster. And the caption did not have to refer to each detail. Nor was the statute a special and local law violative of Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 56, by effect of its application only to counties exceeding a certain population, as what counties were effected could change with each census. The license fee was not an occupational tax in violation of Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 1, 2. The statute was rationally related to a reasonable purpose, and its remittitur feature did not violate Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 55, by extinguishing debts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plurality of votes cast for sheriff in the general election went to a candidate who had died before the election. Appellant voters sought review on direct appeal of the order entered by the trial court that refused to enjoin appellee commissioner court from appointing a sheriff. Appellants contended that no vacancy under Tex. Elec. Code Ann. &sect; 8.22(a) was created because, under &sect; 1.05, a deceased person was ineligible to hold office; therefore, the election was invalid. Appellants also contended that Tex. Elec. Code Ann. &sect; 8.22(a) was unconstitutional under Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 23, art. I, &sect; 19, and U.S. Const. art XIV. The court held that Tex. Elec. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 8.22(a), 1.05 were not in conflict. The counting of votes cast for an ineligible nominee was not for the purpose of electing him, but for the purpose of determining whether any other candidate received the necessary vote for election. Further, the statutory provisions did not unconstitutionally restrict the right of franchise. Because no one was elected sheriff, there was a literal as well as a statutory vacancy which appellees were authorized to fill by appointment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent citizens presented a petition to petitioner judge which sought the incorporation of a town.

After petitioner called the election, 10 affidavits were presented to him in which each affiant was shown to be included on the lost of the 207 inhabitants, but thereupon swore that neither he nor any member of his household ever resided in the area. Petitioner ordered that the election not be held. The election was nevertheless held, and the returns were tendered to petitioner. When petitioner refused to canvas them, respondents filed an action to compel him to do so. The lower court awarded judgment to respondents and held that once petitioner entered an order calling the election, such order could not be revoked. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that if an order calling an election followed a determination of prerequisite of fact by a county judge which would otherwise be final, and if his determination and resulting order were based upon false affidavits, the county judge could rescind his order prior to the election.</SPAN></P>

The Texas State Department of Health was granted leave to intervene on the side of respondents. The trial court denied the temporary injunction and petitioners brought a direct appeal.

The court of appeals reversed and held the provisions constitutional. The court affirmed in part and reversed and rendered in part, finding that article 13.02(2) was not an unreasonable restraint on freedom to contract in that the purpose was to curb unrestrained competition for machine locations, a reasonable exercise of power. The court found, however, that petitioners, whose ownership of coin-operated machines was purely incidental, were not required to obtain a license under article 13.17, &sect; 27(1) for their coin-operated machines.

The appellate court ruled the zoning ordinance invalid and permanently enjoined petitioner from enforcing its provisions as it applied to respondent. .</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner city rezoned two lots that respondent executrix used for commercial purposes, reclassifying them for residential use. Respondent brought suit to continue the non-conforming use of the property. The trial court granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment, but the appellate court reversed, ruling that the ordinance was invalid as it applied to the lots. On further appeal, the court held that the zoning ordinance was within the scope of petitioner's police power, that respondent had not acquired a constitutionally protected vested right in a specific property use from a prior zoning classification, that there was no proof of municipal discretion in the ordinance terminating the nonconforming commercial use, that respondent was given sufficient time to terminate the commercial use and to recoup any loss in property value that occurred from the reclassification, and that respondent failed to show that the ordinance did not promote the good of the community. Accordingly, the appellate court's judgment was reversed and the trial court's judgment for petitioner was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents filed suit to enjoin petitioner state comptroller from disbursing funds appropriated by the legislature for a state university campus to be located upon 600 acres of land. Respondents prayed for a declaration that the regents of the state university had not acquired a suitable site as required by the legislature, that the land had not been deeded to the regents by a proper conveyance and that the land had not been acquired free and clear of debt as required by statute. The court reversed the court of appeal's judgment, which held that the property had not been acquired free and clear of debt because of the way the county handled the transaction. The court affirmed the trial court's summary judgment for petitioner and held that the deeds from the county to the regents were proper conveyances free and clear of debt. Even though the county acquired part of the land by purchase as a park and issued county time warrants to pay for a park and then gave the land away to the university for its purposes, the conveyance was proper because the time warrants issued were general obligations of the county and were not secured by the land in controversy.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. art. 1.05 (Election Code), which required residency in the district for six months prior to filing an application for a place on the primary election ballot. The court noted that the language of the Election Code made it clear that it would not apply to any office for which the state constitution prescribed qualification in conflict therewith. Because the qualifications for state senator, as set forth in Tex. Const. art. 3, &sect; 6, differed from those in the Election Code, the court held that the Election Code did not apply to candidates for the state senate.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order severing a lawsuit into three actions, and transferring them to three counties where appellant subcontractors had filed payment bonds, was reversed on appeal. The court of appeals reasoned that Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 7.01 (1963), upon which the trial court relied, violated Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35, which limited a legislative enactment to a single subject described in its title. On the motion of appellee prime contractors, the appellate court certified three questions pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 461. Answering the basic question in the negative, the court held that the title to 1959 Tex. Gen. Laws 159 was not sufficiently broad to support the validity of Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 7.01 (1963) under Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35. The court answered the first question in the affirmative, concluding that the trial court erred in relying on the statute to require transfer of the actions to three separate counties. The court reasoned that the title of the legislation would not give fair notice that the proposed act would provide for venue of an action against private contractors, an entirely different class of parties than those the title specifically named.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Multiple lawsuits were filed against respondent corporations for violations of the Sunday Closing Law, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 286a. Each of the suits alleged the same cause of action, had essentially identical parties, and, in some of the cases, suit was filed, a temporary restraining obtained, and then a non-suit filed. The trial court granted a temporary injunction prohibiting petitioners, state, attorney general, and district and county attorneys, from filing any new suits against respondents. The court found that because the injunction section of the Sunday Closing Law was civil rather than penal, its use was subject to restriction by a court of equity. The court held that the grant of a temporary injunction was not an abuse of discretion when the relief was necessary to prevent multiplicity of suits, avoid vexatious litigation, and to prohibit the use of judicial processes for the purposes of harassment. Because not all petitioners were given notice or served, the temporary injunction was modified to enjoin only certain district attorneys.

Petitioner sought review of the judgment that denied petitioner's counsel to represent the uninsured driver in a tort case against respondent that was petitioner's insured. The record showed that petitioner had developed a file on respondent under the contractual terms of the policy. Respondent had filed a contract action against petitioner that was severed from the tort case against uninsured driver. Petitioner did not deny that the file contained confidential information and created a conflict. Although the record did not disclose what specific information was in the files, the trial court determined that the file created a conflict. The court of appeals affirmed. The reviewing court held that the decision as to whether there was a conflict of interest was a question that should be left to the discretion of the trial court. The reviewing court affirmed the judgment of the appeals court. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in not allowing petitioner's counsel to represent the uninsured driver against respondent because there was a conflict of interest.</SPAN></P>

The school board adopted an order that the election resulted favorably to the issuance of the bonds, authorized the issuance of the bonds, and levied an ad valorem tax.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought direct review of a judgment of the Judicial District Court of Wichita County (Texas), which dismissed, on the ground that certain provisions of the Texas obscenity statute, Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled that the dismissal of appellant state's obscenity action against appellee movie theatre and its manager, for allegedly showing obscene movies, was error, because contested provisions of the state obscenity statute, Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 527, were not unconstitutional. Sections 1(E), 1(F) of article 527 were merely definitional sections that did not regulate conduct. Moreover, appellees could not challenge &sect; 3, a provision dealing with the &quot;distribution&quot; of obscene materials, as they were only charged with &quot;exhibiting&quot; obscene matter. Nor could they contest &sect; 9 on the ground that it authorized -- without a prior adversary hearing -- issuance of a search warrant for seizure of the obscene materials, as no warrant had been issued. And &sect; 13, which barred the issuance of an injunction without notice to the persons to be enjoined, was improperly stricken because it failed to provide for adequate notice and proper procedural guidelines. Section 13 was not vague, requiring the censor to promptly go to court and only allowing a temporary restraint.

Respondents based their claim of procedural invalidity on the proposition that specific fact-findings were not contained in the promulgating order.

Several criminal charges were filed against employees of respondent clubs for illegal transportation of alcohol. Accordingly, petitioner, Texas Liquor Control Board (Board), instituted license suspension proceedings. The court held that injunctive relief was not proper when the Board was attempting to enforce the statute through administrative license suspension proceedings, criminal charges, and suits for forfeiture. The court found that there was no claim that the statute was unconstitutional and that the license suspension proceedings were still pending. The court further held that a declaratory judgment should not have been rendered when the Board had not yet decided the issue regarding respondents' licenses. The judgment of the appeals court was reversed and temporary injunction dissolved because the appeals court lacked jurisdiction to assert a declaratory judgment for the purpose of overturning the administrative interpretation of the statute so that no further proceedings would be instituted against respondents.</SPAN></P>

Sess. Law Serv. art. 734a &sect; 9. The trial court sustained petitioner's findings, but the court of civil appeals reversed. The court reversed the judgment of the court of civil appeals and affirmed the decision of the trial court.

Petitioner operated as a non-profit organization which was chartered to preserve historical buildings and sites.

The trial court rendered judgment that petitioner's property was exempt from ad valorem taxes under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7150, &sect; 20, because it was a purely public charity. The court of appeals reversed and held that &sect; 20 was unconstitutional in that it violated Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2. The court reversed the court of appeals and affirmed the order of the trial court, holding that respondent's property met the statutory and constitutional tests for the exemption as a charity because respondent met the definition of a purely public charity under Tex.

The trial court's judgment awarded respondent damages on its principal claim and attorney's fees. The appellate court affirmed the judgment.

The supreme court found that inasmuch as there was no provision in the contract for the payment by petitioner of an attorney's fee, the award could not stand unless it was authorized by Tex. Rev.

Moreover, respondent had not rendered any personal services to petitioner, done any labor for petitioner, or furnished any materials to petitioner. The supreme court reformed the judgment in favor of respondent and eliminated the award of attorney's fee to respondent because respondent's claim was not of the type enumerated in art. 2226 that permitted recovery of attorney's fees.

</DIV>

The appellate court granted summary judgment to respondent, and petitioners, district and property owners, sought review, alleging that petitioner district was invalidly organized and that the bond issue had not been authorized by an election as required by Tex. Const. art. 16, &sect; 59(c). The court affirmed and found that petitioners' collateral attack on the validity of petitioner district was precluded because Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7880-25(a) provided two exclusive methods of attacking a district's validity, neither method having been used by petitioners. Similarly, in holding that petitioners were unable to raise a &quot;no election&quot; defense to respondent's action, the court found that petitioners' collateral attack on the bonds was precluded because Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7880-34 and art. 7880-25(a) provided two methods for contesting a bond issue or bond election.

Defendants attacked the constitutionality of Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 286 in extensive pleadings, and the trial court agreed with their arguments when the case came on for trial. The court reasoned that various types of Sunday closing laws in many states had prohibited sales by the use of words very similar to those used in Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 286a. The court found that the laws had been upheld against attack for vagueness. The court found that defendants' contentions that the statute deprived them of property without due process was without merit if the statute was a valid exercise of the police power of the state. The court held that the constitutionality of the Sunday closing law it to be validly related to the health, recreation and welfare of the people.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator was convicted by a United States district court for bank robbery and was sentenced to the custody of the attorney general of the United States. An indictment for the same robbery was then returned in a state trial court, and a detainer was filed against relator. Relator filed a motion in the trial court for a speedy trial and a motion to dismiss the indictment. Relator then sought a writ of mandamus directing respondent judge to grant a speedy trial or dismiss the case, and the court denied the writ, finding it had no jurisdiction. The court held that because relator had not been statutorily authorized to file a motion to dismiss a criminal charge, it was unable to direct respondent to enter an order which respondent was unable to enter. The court found that even if relator had filed an authorized motion to set aside the indictment or abate the prosecution on the ground that relator had been denied a speedy, it would still have lacked jurisdiction to issue the writ because the motion required taking and weighing evidence. The court held that such a motion was to be submitted in the first instance to the trial court and then to the criminal appeals court for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, public school students, sought review of dismissal, on jurisdictional grounds, of their suit declaring Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 301d unconstitutional and enjoining defendant school district from denying minor plaintiffs admission to public schools because of their membership in a so-called charity club. Plaintiffs contended that if applicable to the charity clubs, the statute constituted an unwarranted interference with the constitutionally protected right to free speech and private association. On appeal, the judgment was reversed and remanded. In support of its ruling, the court held that the lower court erred in dismissing the suit on the ground that it had no jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of the statute as the criminal courts could not determine the meaning of the statute unless a prosecution was instituted, and plaintiffs had no way to attack the law except by an administrative appeal. The court further held that it was not necessary for plaintiffs to prosecute an administrative appeal before instituting the present action as questions of law could be determined by the court after the facts concerning the effect of the clubs had been developed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court judgment was reversed and remanded because the court of equity had jurisdiction to review the constitutionality of the statute in question, which prevented plaintiffs, public school students, membership in a certain club.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the order of the 116th Judicial District Court, Dallas County (Texas), which permanently enjoined him from, inter alia, administering lie detection examinations, and from publicly professing to be a polygraph examiner, without first complying with the Polygraph Examiners Act., Tex.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant lie detector operator was permanently enjoined by the trial court from administering lie detection examinations, from publicly professing to be a polygraph examiner (or lie detector operator), and from administering or offering to administer examinations of any type for the purpose of verifying the truth of statements, without first complying with the provisions of the Polygraph Examiners Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. 2615f-2. Appellant contended that the Act was unconstitutional because its title did not fully disclose the contents of the Act, and therefore, did not put the legislature, which passed the Act, or the public on notice that the Act applied not only to polygraph examiners but also to all persons who used any device or instrument for the purpose of verifying the truth of statements. The court agreed and on that basis reversed and dissolved the injunction, finding that the Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, ballroom dance hall operators, challenged a decision in an action was filed by appellee, state of Texas to recover unpaid admissions taxes alleged to be owing under Tex. Tax-Gen. Stat. Ann. arts. 21.02 - 21.04. Defendants attacked the statutes on constitutional grounds. Appellants argued that the statutes violated Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2, which required that occupation taxes should be equal and uniform upon the same class of subjects, and denied them equal protection in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. On appeal, the court held that art. 21.01 provided that every person operating any place of amusement which charged for admission was to file reports and pay a tax in rates and amounts as thereinafter provided. Article 21.02 then divided places of amusement into several categories and prescribed the tax applicable to each category. The constitution of Texas implied power in the legislature to classify the subjects of occupation taxes and only required that the tax be equal and uniform upon the same class. The courts could only interfere when an attempted classification had no reasonable basis in the nature of the businesses classified.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the temporary injunction. Appellant sought review from the court directly from a trial court because the matter pertained to the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of a statute. Appellee brought a motion to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction because appellant did not timely file their appeal. The court held that the timely filing of a record in compliance with Tex. R. Civ. Proc. 385 was necessary to confer jurisdiction of an appeal from an interlocutory order in the appellate court. The court found Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4662 (1939) was applicable in setting forth the twenty day appeal period from temporary injunctions and Tex. R. Civ. Proc. 385 was promulgated for the purpose of prescribing procedure in accord with this statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator oil company never paid anything to the state on its awards. Its tender was several months late. Under the law of rescission, upon which relator relied, a purchaser who paid no part of the purchase money and made no improvements on the property, had no equities that entitled him to defeat a rescission by the vendee. Relator filed a petition for writ of mandamus asking the court to order respondent commissioner of the general land office to accept its tender of rentals for certain mineral awards. The court denied mandamus because relator did not produce proof that it met the standards required for issuance of a writ of mandamus. Relator failed to comply with Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5395, for payment following the mineral rights award. Respondent refused relator's tender of the rentals because the tender was not timely, and amounted to a forfeiture. Respondent's refusal to accept the rentals and the reason given relator's representative was a clear statement that relator's rights were terminated. The record was made confirming that fact. The court found that this was an effective declaration of the forfeitures within respondent's discretion.</SPAN></P>

Respondent's forfeiture was a permissible act of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This controversy turned upon the constitutionality of a statute that provided a manner of taxation for the financing of hospital districts. The county established a teaching hospital and plaintiff citizens sued to permanently enjoin the levying, assessment, and collection of taxes under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4494n. The county also sought a declaration that the statute was unconstitutional. Defendants were the county judge, county commissioners, and county tax collector. The trial court upheld the validity of the statute and denied the injunction. The case was brought directly to the court under Tex. R. Civ. P. 499a. After review, the court concluded that the bill was not a local or special bill, the caption was not defective, the bill was not a revenue bill, and the bill did not offend U.S. Const. amend. XIV.

The city sought a declaration that the ordinance was a valid exercise of the powers reserved to the city; the ordinance was a lawful exercise of its police powers and the ordinance was impliedly incorporated into the franchise as a part of the company's franchise with the city. The trial court sustained the company in its contentions and permanently enjoined the city from requiring a permit as a condition precedent to the extension of its line to the new customer.

Petitioner state of Texas brought suit on behalf of the Fund against respondents questioning the validity of the lease and seeking to terminate the leasing power of respondent surface owner as a statutory agent of the state. The lower court held that the lease was valid. On appeal, the court held that the agreement was not valid because the leasing power of respondent surface owner was limited by the Relinquishment Act and the extraordinary benefit of the working interest option to respondent surface owner, with no benefit flowing to the state, violated the Act. The court found that, because there was no evidence that respondent surface owner acted in bad faith or fraudulently, there was no reason to remove him as a statutory leasing agent for the state.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the rule was grounded upon substantial evidence because the necessity for such a rule was demonstrated by the support it received from the members of the professional societies. The court found that the legislature, in failing to enact the specific provisions, intended to provide a better method for petitioner to regulate the profession, and that was by empowering it with express authorization to tailor make its rules for the particular needs of the profession and the public so long as they are relevant to the statutory proscriptions. The court reversed the lower court's holding and affirmed the trial court's denial of a permanent injunction against petitioner and sustained the validity of the rule.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that petitioner was not statutorily limited on such passing, because under its discretion it could give preference to applications which effectuated the maximum utilization of waters. The court also found that respondent did not illegally delegate its exclusive authority to administer water rights because there was no showing that the permit granted to the river authority impaired existing water rights or was detrimental to the public welfare.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator was a corporation which sought to acquire mineral leases to prospect for sulphur on certain lands designated as free public school lands by the state, and sold with a reservation of mineral rights in the state. Relator filed his applications in accordance with Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5388-5403. The commissioner of the Texas land office denied relator's applications, contending the rights were governed by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5421c-7. Relator brought a suit for mandamus. The court issued the writ of mandamus and directed the commissioner to issue the mineral lease rights to relator, holding that articles 5388-5403 were not repealed by article 5421c-7, because that act contained an exception for sulphur and did not apply to public school lands sold with a reservation of mineral rights to the state, leaving articles 5388-5403 to govern sulphur and certain other minerals located under public school lands sold with a reservation of minerals to the state.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the appellate court and affirmed the trial court. The court held that defendant failed to obtain petitioner's release or condemn the property in compliance with Tex. Rev. Civ.

The court found that respondent had the police power to erect temporary barriers and signs that were reasonably necessary to protect the public from danger. The court noted that petitioners' proper remedy was not the &quot;self-help&quot; burning of the barricade, but a writ of mandamus to compel consent to improve and open the easement in a reasonable manner.

The court held that relators were eligible to hold the office of attorney general and were not disqualified by virtue of their senatorial terms of office. Tex.

Upon rehearing, the circuit court of appeals entered an order under the abstention doctrine staying further proceedings in the federal courts until the state court had been afforded an opportunity to rule in a declaratory judgment suit on the meaning of the limitation clause. The court held that the federal circuit court's reservation of jurisdiction to render final judgment in the case rendered the state proceedings a request for an advisory opinion which the state court was not authorized under the state constitution to give.

Petitioner filed suit for a temporary restraining order, which was denied, then sought review in the appellate court, which affirmed the prior denial. On appeal, the court reversed, and held that the controversy was not moot because the subject permit was only of one year's duration and renewable annually, and respondent's order affected petitioner's right to obtain a new permit. Although Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 7.21 did not provide for notice and a hearing prior to revocation or suspension of a cigarette distributor's permit, it was not unconstitutional because these provisions could be incorporated by implication. The court ruled that the permit was somewhere between a privilege and a property right, and that once it was granted, it could not be taken away except for good cause. The court held that petitioner was entitled to due process of law, and issued a writ of injunction pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 501.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent corporation sued petitioner individual and another individual and recovered judgment upon a jury verdict against both for $ 780.00, owing upon what respondent alleged was a negotiable promissory note. The lower court affirmed. Respondent appealed on grounds that he was not liable on a negotiable instrument on which his name did not appear, and also that the note contained a variance between the figures and the unambiguous written words stating the amount payable. The court reformed the judgment of the lower courts because it determined that the instrument sued upon was not a negotiable instrument. It had written on it in longhand: &quot;It is hereby understood that $ 1000. (sic) overpayments will be made on future house deliveries until this obligation is paid.&quot; The court determined that parol evidence was properly admitted to prove that petitioner had ratified the execution of the note and thus he was liable on the non-negotiable note. The court reformed the amount owed to respondent because it determined that the amount stated in the unambiguous written words as opposed to the figures on the promissory note should have had controlling effect.</SPAN></P>

Respondents contended that petitioner's claims were barred on their face by the applicable two-year limitation period, and the trial court agreed. The court of civil appeals affirmed the trial court. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the lower courts erred in sustaining respondents' special exceptions urging the two-year limitation period. The court noted that local law unambiguously exempted incorporated cities from the two-year limitation period. The court noted that since its predecessor water district was unincorporated 10 months of the limitation had run against petitioner as subrogee.</SPAN></P>

A default judgment was entered, and the maker appealed. The appellate court affirmed. On further appeal, the court found that the holder had failed to allege that the maker did not maintain a regular place of business in Texas or a designated agent upon whom service could be made, as required by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2031b(3). The court held that service by way of the Secretary of State under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art 2031b(3) was only available after a showing that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2031b(2) was not available. The court found that no presumptions could be made in favor of jurisdiction in a direct attack on a default judgment.

Respondent revoked petitioner's medical license. Petitioner filed appeal from respondent's decision pursuant to the Medical Practice Act of 1907, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4506 (art. 4506). In a de novo jury trial, jury found that petitioner prescribed narcotic drugs to known addicts and that such conduct was unprofessional. The trial court, however, granted petitioner's motion for judgment non obstante veredicto and denied respondent's right to cancel petitioner's license. The intermediary appellate court reversed decision and remanded case for new trial, holding that art. 4506 was unconstitutional. Both parties filed applications for writ of error. On appeal, the court upheld constitutionality of art. 4506 on the grounds that revocation of medical licenses was a judicial function. The court affirmed grant of petitioner's motion for judgment because respondent failed to prove that petitioner was not acting in good medical faith or that prescriptions were not issued in response to medical need.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators filed a writ of mandamus seeking an order directing respondent commissioner to accept and file an oil and gas lease given by petitioner owner to petitioner lessee.

Ann. art. 5367 et seq., petitioner owner, as owner of the soil, was the agent of the State with the exclusive right to negotiate and execute oil and gas leases on behalf of the State. The court agreed holding, that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 3281 (1934) conferred no power on respondent commissioner to execute leases for oil and gas, and other mineral development on escheated land which had been sold by the State from the Permanent Free School Fund. When the land was sold with a reservation of all minerals, the Relinquishment Act of 1919 made the owner of the soil the agent of the State for the purpose of negotiating and executing oil and gas leases thereon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators filed suits alleging that they should be exempt from certain state liquor laws. They prevailed in the trial court, receiving both an injunction against the enforcement of the laws against them. Respondents appealed, posting no bond. The intermediate appellate court issued a writ of prohibition staying the trial court judgment. Relators asked the court to issue a writ requiring the respondent intermediate appellate court to reinstate the trial court's judgment pending a final disposition of the case in a court of last resort. The court refused. The court first rejected relators' assertion that respondents' appeal was improperly filed, finding that under Tex. R. Civ. P. 364, state agencies were not required to give bond on any appeal or writ of error taken by it in any civil case. The court then held that the relief requested by relators was not within its jurisdiction to award because the intermediate appellate court was within its discretion in issuing the writ of prohibition. The writ of mandamus would not lie to control official discretion or to correct mere errors in the exercise of judicial power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the writ application and vacated the stay order it previously entered. The court found that respondent was not required to post a supersedeas bond because it was a state agency, that the intermediate appellate court had the authority to issue a writ of prohibition disallowing enforcement of the trial court judgment, and that it would not interfere with the exercise of the intermediate appellate court's jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

In each instance, Board certified to Treasurer that respondent owed for each year the amount of taxes shown on the annual reports. Respondent remitted those amounts to Board, which delivered the remittances to Treasurer. The remittances of the certified amounts were prerequisite to respondent's right to the issuance of a permit to continue its business in the state. Respondent later filed suit to recover overpayments to the state of occupation taxes. The trial court found in respondent's favor, and the intermediary appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court also affirmed. The court held that the overpayment of taxes by respondent resulted from incorrect certifications, and the payments by respondent of the amounts certified were payments under duress of the certifications and of the applicable statutory provisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments of the lower courts, holding that respondent had a valid claim for recovery of the overpayment of taxes included in the petitioners' certification for the years in question and paid under duress.</SPAN></P>

It did cumulate the permanent partial disabilities in accordance with the duration and percentages of disability found by the jury. The appellate court reformed the judgment to cumulate the temporary total loss of use of the members based on its reading of Tex. Civ. Stat. art. 8306, &sect; 12. This court reversed and affirmed the trial court's judgment. Under art. 8306, &sect; 12, the concurrent temporary loss or loss of use of specific members resulting from injuries received in one accident could not be cumulated. Respondent was entitled to cumulate the recovery of compensation as to time for the permanent partial loss or the permanent total loss of use of a specific member or members.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 911(b) (1963). If the transportation involved fell within the statute, a permit would have to be obtained to use a truck and it would be a misdemeanor to operate a truck without a permit. The court granted petitioner's request to dissolve the injunction and held that the trucking company did not have a property right in their operations that would be irreparably damaged by petitioners proceeding to enforce the provisions of the statutes in question. The court held that enforcement of the statute would not cause irreparable injury to the business of trucking company because it could still ship its products over the highways by any licensed certificated carrier, and if criminal proceedings were initiated, there would be ample opportunity to question the validity of the statute in the criminal proceedings.</SPAN></P>

He sought a continuance of the case under the mandatory continuance statute, Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. 2168a, because the state senate was in session. Respondent district judge denied the motion, ruling that the statute was invalid solely because it violated Tex. Const. art. II, &sect; 1, relating to the division of powers of state government into three distinct departments. Relators sought mandamus. The court discussed the continuance statute in the context of the interrelationships among the branches of state government. There were many instances of legislative action with respect to the courts. The court distinguished an Oklahoma case concerning continuances and the authority of the courts. Oklahoma simply ascribed to a different principle. The court stated that the issue was governed by a case decided in 1947. The court held that the mandatory continuance statute did not violate the state constitution. The court conditionally granted the writ of mandamus.

Respondent contended that relator was created in violation of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7880-1(a). The court granted relator's writ of mandamus and held that art. 7880-1(a) violated Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35 because the title of the bill was misleading and did not give fair notice of its content. The court found that the title misled a reader into believing that the bill had no application to any type of water district other than the two specified in the title. The court determined that the purpose of the bill was to establish restrictions as to those two types of districts. On the contrary, the statutory intention was to prohibit the creation of any type of water district other than the two mentioned. The court rejected respondent's argument that adding a word to the title would make the statute constitutionally sufficient, because the constitutional title requirement would be rendered meaningless if titles could later be upheld by word transpositions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Husband was insured under insurance policies purchased with community funds, and wife was designated beneficiary. Husband and wife died in a common disaster. Both died intestate and without children. The common administrator for the parties' estates divided the insurance policy proceeds equally between the two estates. The probate court ordered, however, that all proceeds of the insurance policies be inventoried as assets of husband's estate. On appeal by respondents, wife's heirs, the trial court held that each estate was entitled to one-half of the total proceeds. The lower appellate court affirmed. Petitioners, husband's heirs, appealed. In agreement with the probate court, the appellate court reversed the judgments of the trial and lower appellate courts. In the absence of evidence of which spouse died first, it was statutorily presumed under Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 47(e) that the insured husband survived for purposes of distributing insurance proceeds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator applied for a Texas State bank charter. The State Banking Board (board) approved the application, and the State Banking Commissioner delivered to relator a certified copy of the articles of association of the new bank. Intervenors, two other banks, protested the granting of the charter and filed suit in district court. Respondent Banking Commissioner of Texas refused to issue the certificate of authority for relator to start in business because of intervenors' pending suit. Relator filed a motion for leave to file a petition for writ of mandamus to require respondent to issue the certificate of authority. The court found that when relator had met all necessary requirements, respondent had the authority and the duty to issue the certificate of authority to relator even though an appeal had been taken from the board's order granting the bank charter to relator.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that respondent should issue the certificate of authority as requested by relator.

Respondents had determined the validity of relator's revenue bonds and the use of funds for improvement of airport runways. When respondents denied the writ, relator sought a writ from the court that would require respondents to issue a writ. The court found that it was respondents' duty to enforce the judgment and to issue necessary writs to restrain plaintiffs and their attorney from further prosecution. The court reviewed plaintiffs' pleadings and found that, while the parties were not the same, the issues were or could have been litigated in the first suit. The court found that it was immaterial that the first suit was not a class action because it was a hybrid type class that bound all members of the class insofar as the validity of relator's bonds and relator's right to use the funds.

The property owners conceded that the tax was authorized by article 2815h, &sect; 7, but they argued that the levy of an ad valorem tax for support and maintenance of a junior college was unconstitutional. The junior college district argued that the legislature was fully empowered to authorize them to levy an ad valorem tax. On appeal, the court concluded that the legislative power to authorize the junior college district to levy an ad valorem tax was supported by the provisions of Tex. Const. art. 7, &sect; 3 (1926); therefore, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2815h, &sect; 7 was valid and enforceable. Furthermore, for many years such taxes had been levied with no challenge from the public.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought to impose a tax on the entertainment company pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 21.02, &sect; 1. The trial court denied appellants' petition for a temporary injunction against the company. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the statute was unconstitutional because it was plainly a revenue measure. It did not relate in any way to the public safety, morals, convenience, or general welfare of the citizens. Under the provisions of the statute, anyone who exhibited a motion picture or play at a place other than a fixed and regularly established motion picture theater must pay the tax. Another person who exhibited the same picture or play in an adjoining building escaped payment of the taxes merely because he regularly showed motion pictures in that building. The discrimination was plain. The court held that the tax in question was an occupation tax within the meaning of Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2, which provided that all occupation taxes should be equal and uniform upon the same class of subjects within the limits of the authority levying the tax. The legislature's classification for the tax based on the place where the entertainment was given was invalid.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a striking down of this proration order would, in the natural course of things, enjoin upon the commission the duty to write a new order, but it was not within the scope of its jurisdiction to direct the commission in that regard. The court did not have jurisdiction of the commission to require compulsory cycling and pressure maintenance in the field.

Upon review, the court held that the section was unconstitutional under &sect; 35 because the section, which authorized the condemnation of the lands of private citizens, did not concern prison lands in any way. Because the caption did not state that it concerned the acquisition of prison lands or lands which were about to be prison lands, the court held that the caption did not reasonably give fair notice to a legislator or any other person interested in the act's subject matter that the act provided for the condemnation of private lands. The court held that the section, which concerned the condemning and acquisition of private lands, was not reasonably related to the subject of the caption, which used the words &quot;concerning prison lands.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed an action in a district court against the taxpayer for delinquent unemployment compensation contributions and for penalties. The case was tried upon the merits before the court and judgment was entered in favor of the taxpayer. The court of civil appeals determined that the district court was without jurisdiction and it dismissed the State's appeal. On review, the court noted that if the action was one for a penalty then the district court had jurisdiction to hear the matter pursuant to Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 8. However, the court stated that if the action was for a debt consisting of taxes and the penalties were only a part of those taxes then the county court had jurisdiction pursuant to Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 16. In addition, the court determined that the impositions for failure to pay taxes have always been penalties. The court further held that the penalty and interest added to delinquent taxes was not an incident of the taxes but was a separate and distinct item provided by the legislature as a punishment for failure to pay taxes and was therefore a penalty under the Texas Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed and remanded for a trial on the merits. The appellate court's judgment was affirmed. The court held that the district court and the administrative authorities had coordinate jurisdiction in a suit involving the annexing of school districts. The court rejected the school trustees' argument that art. 2686 had been repealed, but held that that the mere giving of notice of appeal to the administrative authorities was not a binding election.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, although it would normally not entertain mandamus proceedings to interfere with injunctive orders of a trial court, the jurisdictional conflict between the district courts had reached a point where the conflict was to be relieved by the court. The court determined that the Tex. Acts &sect; 14 (1929) set up the jurisdiction of the Criminal District Court of Jefferson County by providing that the 58th and 60th Judicial Districts were to have concurrent jurisdiction. The Act further provided that neither was to have criminal jurisdiction and that such jurisdiction was to be vested exclusively in a criminal district court. The court held that, although the legislature was permitted to create courts under Tex. Const. art. 5, &sect; 1, it was not permitted to confer concurrent jurisdiction on them and could not deprive them of jurisdiction conferred on them by the constitution. The court granted the writs against respondent and ordered petitioner judge one to proceed to hearing on the writ of habeas corpus of petitioner judge two.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 881a-1 violated its due process rights. The trial court did not determine the constitutionality of Tex. Rev. Civ.

The court denied relief to the bank, determining that it had no right of appeal under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 1738a.

Appellant attacked that order and sought a permanent injunction in the trial court, but judgment was entered for appellee. Appellant sought review. Although the court rejected appellant's arguments that the applicable insurance code provisions were unconstitutional and that the commissioner erred in interpreting the policy, it agreed the trial court erred in applying the substantial evidence rule to its review of the administrative order. The court found that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

The court held that: 1) a taking within constitutional provision, to the effect that no property could be taken for public use without compensation, occurred when operation of the dam and consequent formation of a lake filled with silt and caused flooding of the city's sewage disposal plant, which had been erected prior to dam, and the river authority needed to compensate the city for the taking; and 2) the city, after being paid for damage for the taking of its sewage plant, would not be entitled to claim further damage to its channel reservoir and its water treatment plant because the city continued to operate a sewage disposal plant despite its susceptibility to repeated flooding.</SPAN></P>

The fireman's request for reconsideration of reinstatement was rejected. Respondents asserted that Tex. Rev. Civ.

The legislature had attempted to amend Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art.1269m, &sect; 9 to require that the physician submit a report. The court upheld the district court judgment granted to the fireman. The caption of the amendatory Act did not mention &sect; 9, and the attempted amendment was unconstitutional under Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35. Under Tex. Rev. Civ.

The appellate court affirmed. The court reversed the judgment for the landowners. It was essential to due process that the landowners were given an opportunity to be heard before the amount of compensation was determined. The amount could be assessed prior to a hearing if an appeal to a court carried with it the right to have the matter determined upon a full trial. Although art. 7880-126 allowed for the tribunal to issue its proposed report with a hearing, a full opportunity was given for reviewing the tribunal's findings, and a trial de novo was available before the district court.

The Court of Civil Appeals for the Fourth District (Texas) reversed a trial court decision that dismissed the action and held the election void.

Under &sect; 5 of the Act, however, only qualified voters owning taxable property who had duly rendered the same for taxation were entitled to vote. Petitioners alleged that the voting restriction was unconstitutional, and that if the full electorate of the city would have voted, the Act would have been adopted. The court reversed the court of appeals, and held that the limitation of voters to owners of taxable property was constitutional. A determination of the question of whether the Act was unconstitutional turned primarily on whether the election necessarily involved the expenditure of money or whether the election only called for the expression of the voters on a matter of public policy. The Act was related to issuing bonds and collecting taxes, and Tex. Const. art. VI, &sect;&sect; 3, 3a made it clear that property ownership was an essential qualification of voters regarding an election that determined if money was going to be spent by a city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state securities commissioner entered an order revoking the dealer's registration as a securities dealer in Texas. The dealer filed an action against the commissioner and members of the state securities board seeking a restraining order, temporary and permanent injunctions to restrain enforcement of the order, and a declaratory judgment interpreting provisions of the Securities Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. arts. 581-1 to 581-39. The trial court denied a permanent injunction and all other relief and found the revocation order valid. The court dismissed the dealer's appeal, concluding that it lacked jurisdiction. The court reasoned that whereas Tex. Const. art. 5, &sect; 3-b empowered the legislature to provide for direct appeals to the court in cases in which a trial court's order denying an injunction was based on the validity or of a state agency's order, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1738a did not exercise that power, but authorized such appeals only in cases of a state board or commission order, and that the dealer's registration revocation was not such an order. The court found that a single administrative or executive officer did not constitute a &quot;board or commission.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city and the city officials filed a cross-complaint against the taxpayers for a declaratory judgment regarding the contract. The court affirmed the judgment and answered the questions that were certified by the court of appeals. The court held that Tex. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3 did not make the contract invalid. The fact that the railroads were relieved of financial burdens which they could have been required to bear did not render the acquisition of the right of way a donation in the constitutional sense, and therefore art. XI, &sect; 3 was not violated. The railroad was merely being compensated for what it gave up by substitution of the new right of way for the old. The court also held that the city charter did not deny the city the authority to make the contract. Finally, the court held that the city's undertakings under the contract were not outside the scope of the bond proposition approved by an election.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had granted the injunction to preserve the status quo during the appeal of its order setting aside the commission's orders that drastically reduced the gas well owner's production.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission originally classified the subject well as a discovery well in a new field that was entitled to produce at the rate of 25 percent of its potential. As a result of a redetermination, the commission found that the well was in a common field subject to pro-ration orders and the gas well owner's allowable production was cut drastically. The trial court set aside the commission's pro-ration order as void ab initio, and the commission appealed. The trial court granted the gas well owner's motion for injunctive relief to preserve the status quo during the appeal, but the appellate court issued a writ of prohibition and the trial court dissolved the temporary injunction. The court dismissed the gas well owner's appeal of the order dissolving the injunction for want of jurisdiction. The court concluded that its power to hear a direct appeal of an order denying an injunction on the grounds of the validity or invalidity of an administrative order issued pursuant to a state statute or upon the grounds of the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of a statute did not include an order that denied injunctive relief on the ground of an appellate court's writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>

The election committed claimed that the act of the legislature for creating the office of the district court judge at issue was invalid insofar as it attempted to limit the term of the first judge elected to the court to a two year term ending December 31, 1960. The court held that under Tex. Const. art. V, a judge was elected for a four-year term in 1958. Accordingly, there could not be a legal election for the position of a district court judge in the general election of 1960. The court held that where the constitution fixed the term of an office at four years, an act of the legislature, providing for an election to fill the office and limiting the term of the office to be elected to two years, was void as to the limitation, but constitutional and valid as to the residue. The court denied the practicing attorney's petition for a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued defendant to enjoin eminent domain proceedings against his property, a tax levy, and the expenditure of public funds on an urban renewal project. Plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of the Texas Urban Renewal Law (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 12691-3. The parties waived a jury, and the district court declared the provision of the statute requiring a complete de novo trial in court to be invalid. However, the district court upheld the actions of the defendant city and the renewal agency, upon the validity of other portions of the Act, and upon findings that their actions were fair and reasonable. The court affirmed, holding that if an order was reasonably supported by substantial evidence it was reasonable; otherwise, it was unreasonable, and court found that provision requiring de novo trial was unconstitutional because it required the court to determine a legislative question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county hospital district (district) appealed the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals for the Fourth District (Texas), which had affirmed the judgment of the trial court that granted the summary judgment motion filed by appellees, city, county, and auditor, in the district's action for declaratory judgment to determine entitlement to delinquent taxes under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4494n and Tex. Const. art. IX, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district was created to provide hospital services under the enabling act, and in accordance with Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4494n, it sought to recover the portion of delinquent taxes city and county taxes that had been levied for the previous city and county hospital systems. When the city and county refused to turn over the taxes, the district filed an action for declaratory relief against the city, the county, and the auditor. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment filed by the city, the county, and the auditor, and the district appealed. The appellate court affirmed, but upon further appeal, the court reversed in part. It held that although the district was a corporation and the delinquent taxes were public money, the transfer of funds did not violate Tex. Const. art. IX, &sect; 4 because the delinquent taxes were levied to finance a specific function and were limited to that use. However, the sinking funds that were supposed to be held in trust for the bondholders were to be set aside and applied only the retirement of that bonded indebtedness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the portion of the judgment that determined that the district was not entitled to sinking funds, but it reversed the remainder of the judgment and required the city and county to pay to the district the remaining delinquent taxes that the district was entitled to receive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney general refused to allow the county to use revenue bonds to add to existing trailer park facilities in a county park on Padre Island. He argued, inter alia, that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 6079c, &sect; 1, which authorized the expenditure, was unconstitutional as a special law. The court granted the writ of mandamus and ordered the attorney general to approve the bonds. The court found that a statute under constitutional attack was to be construed as valid if reasonably possible. A statute was not local even though its operation was confined to a restricted area if persons throughout the state were affected by it or if it operated on a subject in which the people at large were interested. Although art. 6079c was applicable only to coastal counties, the maintenance of public parks in those counties was a matter of interest to people throughout the state. Thus the classification was not unreasonable because it was for the public good. The court also held that the construction of trailer park facilities was authorized under art. 6079 because they benefitted for those traveling about the country for recreational or business purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the question in the negative and found that the amendment at issue could not be regarded as a local law because it had universal application throughout the state. The court also found that the amendment was not a special act within the contemplation of the constitutional prohibition for the legislature possessed broad power to make classifications for legislative purposes and to pass laws in application thereto. The court did not agree with the argument that there was any denial of equal protection under the amendment. The court also determined that the constitutionality of a statutory provision permitting the collecting by the district court of a fee in divorce cases had not been properly raised and, therefore, could not be answered. The court concluded that, considering that the wife had not asserted that she paid the fee or that execution had been levied, or any other action taken to enforce collection from her, the wife was still able to contest the legality of the charge when a proper demand was made for payment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents denied the water company's application for a permit to appropriate water from a river. The water company initiated a lawsuit against respondents that was dismissed by the trial court. The appellate court reversed the judgment of dismissal and remanded the case for trial. The water company filed a petition for review of the appellate court judgment because it declared &sect; 13 unconstitutional on the ground that it conferred administrative duties upon the judicial branch of government. The court declared &sect; 13 void because the legislature was allowed to provide for strict de novo trials of statutory issues decided by respondents and it failed to do so. The court held that the invalidity of &sect; 13 did not render Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

Section 13 provided for the manner and procedure of trials and was severable from Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner-defendant city sought review of a judgment from the Court of Civil Appeals for the Tenth District (Texas), which reversed a summary judgment that denied respondent-plaintiff property owner recovery in a negligence action. The appellate court held that the city was not immune under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 46d, &sect; 15 from liability for negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue presented on review was whether ownership and operation of an airport by the city pursuant to &sect; 15 was a governmental function in the sense that it rendered the city immune from liability for negligence in burning grass on the airport premises. As a result of the burning grass, certain property, which belonged to property owner and was stored there by him under contractual arrangement with the city, was destroyed or damaged. On review, the appellate judgment was reversed, and the judgment of the trial court was affirmed. The court found that the fact that the airport was operated by the city, as distinguished from a county, state, or the nation, did not of itself make it less governmental by nature than it might otherwise be. The court further found that the fact that the sovereign immunity of a state or county was vastly broader than that of the city did not create a presumption against the operation of the airport as being considered governmental. Therefore, the court concluded that airport operation was not such a long and well-established source of municipal liability as to be beyond the power of the legislature to decree that it did not exist.</SPAN></P>

The detectives originally claimed that the contempt order violated their privilege against self-incrimination, but on appeal claimed that article 9.02 was unconstitutional. The district attorney had initiated the inquiry and filed the motion for contempt, but argued that the detectives should be released because the commitment order became functus officio after the detectives were released on bail by the appellate court. The court held that the release on bail was a mere temporary release and that no statutory or constitutional provision required new formalities as a prerequisite to valid restraint. The court remanded the detectives to the sheriff's custody and held that article 9.02 was constitutional because its caption was sufficient under Tex. Const. art.

Stat. art. 1269m requiring cities of a certain population to maintain paid fire and police department and civil service. The City argued that the statute was unconstitutional as it was a local or special law on account of the limiting provision of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 1269m, &sect; 27(a). The lower court entered judgment in favor of the individuals. The City brought an application for a writ of error. The court denied the application. The court held that the statute did not violate Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 56. The court found that the intent of the legislature was that it should not only be applicable to those cities having a population of 10,000 or more, but also to cities which subsequently might be found by a later census to have attained that many inhabitants. In providing in &sect; 27(a) for the holding of elections within 90 days from the effective date of the statute, the legislature made reference not to the date on which the statute became a law but to the date on which, by virtue of its population status, the statute became effective as to a particular city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was the contention of the attorney general, as the legal representative of the State Board and its Commissioner, that orders appointing the receiver were void because they contravened the expressed will of the Legislature. The court sustained this contention. The court held that the failure of a court to observe a mandatory statutory provision conferring a right or forbidding particular action rendered its order or judgment void. The controlling question was whether or not the statutory provision that the liquidator designated by the Insurance Commissioner was to be the receiver in the liquidation proceeding before a court was mandatory or merely directory. The court held that Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21. &sect; 2(a) was not directory and was not unconstitutional. The court held that the orders appointing the receiver were void because they were in contravention of a valid statutory enactment. The court found no misperformance on the part of the Board or Commissioner which justified an action in disregarding the statutory mandate that said that the duly appointed liquidator was to act as receiver.</SPAN></P>

The court found that it was not allowed to engraft exceptions upon a statute when a lawmaking power had not done so. The court found that the statute that permitted an unincorporated associated to sue or be sue, Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6137, merely furnished a convenient method of conducting suits.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants licensed optometrists sought appellate review of a temporary injunction issued by the trial court (Texas) against professional advertising. Appellants contended that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 4565g was void because its caption was defective and failed to clearly state the purpose of the law in violation of Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35. The case was appealed, and a motion rehearing was filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the motion for rehearing and issued an opinion holding that the advertisement by appellants for their professional services as optometrists did not violate Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. tit. 71, ch. 10, art. 44565g as amended because the advertisements contained prices for eyeglasses. The court held that the purpose of the constitutional provision requiring legislative enactments to contain material captions was to enable legislators and others to know a bill's contents without reading the entire act. The court held that it liberally construed captions on legislation in favor of their constitutionality. The court held that the article as amended had a caption containing a reference to advertising. The court held that appellees' contention that the advertisement violated the Texas Constitution was without merit because the caption of the amendatory act expressly stated that the body of the act included a provision for advertising prices of eyeglasses.

The lessee sought to enjoin the city school district from attempting to collect ad valorem taxes from the lessee. Congress gave its consent to tax the government property through 10 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1270d. At issue was whether the leasehold estate was assessed by the school district, as distinguished from the assessment of the property itself, or as a fee interest. In the lease, the lessee agreed to pay all taxes. The court found that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5248 did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. The court also found that the statute was not discriminatory and that it was valid legislation and authorized the taxation of the lessee's property by the school district. The court overruled the school district's contention in its application that taxes up to the date of the amendment to the statute were a valid charge against the lessee. The assent given by Congress to taxation of the plant was not effective in Texas until the amendment of article 5248, and it was only from and after that date that the property may be lawfully taxed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the ordinance was a proper exercise of the city's police power and was not invalid as a matter of law though it operated to place a restriction upon the private owner in the use of its property. The owner failed to show that the refusal of a permit for a driveway on the street would have been oppressive, arbitrary, or would have interfered unreasonably with the operation of his garage or that it could not have been conducted profitably and economically without the additional driveway.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The general ground for the injunction was that appellant was practicing medicine as defined in Art. 4510, Vernon's Texas Civ. Stat., and was doing so without possessing (and thus without having registered with the district clerk) the certificate evidencing his right to practice medicine required by Art. 4498. The restraints of the decree were conditioned upon the absence of such license and registration. Appellant did have a license to practice naturopathy under a statute known as Article 4590d, Vernon's Texas Civ. Stats., which purported to recognize and regulate the practice of naturopathy, defining it as that philosophy and system of the healing art embracing prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human ills and functions by the use of several properties of air, light, heat, cold, water, manipulation with the use of such substances, nutritional as are naturally found in and required by the body, excluding drugs, surgery, X-ray and radium therapy, and the use of X-ray equipment. The court affirmed the trial court's grant of the injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The oil and gas lessee held a lease from the state that covered land, adjacent to the landowners' property, located in the bed of a river.

State commissioners awarded the tract to the oil and gas lessee. The state intervened at trial and adopted the oil and gas lessee's pleadings. The trial court found in favor of petitioners, but the appellate court reversed, insofar as the appellate court concluded that while the statute was constitutional, it did not authorize the condemnation of land for use as a site to drill a directional well. The court reversed. The court held that the statute, expressly and by necessary implication, granted the power to condemn property on the river bank for use as a site to drill a directional well into the river bed. The court held that the taking was for a public use because the terms of the lease dedicated a portion of the profit to a state school fund.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners argued that respondent had no power to select the attorney because the sole and exclusive authority for such appointments was vested in the Insurance Commissioner and the state board (Board). In declining to issue the mandamus, the court concluded that respondent was exercising a discretionary authority vested in him by the statutory provisions relating to liquidation of insurance companies and such action, therefore, could not be considered void. According to the court, it could not hold that respondent had acted capriciously or arbitrarily in rejecting an attorney appointed by the Board. If, in the discharge of the duties of supervision placed upon him by statute, respondent decided that other or additional counsel was essential to the proper administration of a pending receivership case, such decision could not be held void in a mandamus action in the absence of a clear showing of unreasonable, capricious, and arbitrary action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State of California challenged a judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals for the Tenth District (Texas), which reversed an award to California in its action to recover from respondent son money expended by the State in the care, support, and maintenance of the son's mother in a California state institution prior to and after the son became domiciled in Texas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of California sought to recover from the son money expended in the care of his mother in a state institution prior to and after the son became domiciled in Texas. Texas did not have a law requiring an adult son to reimburse sums expended in the care and maintenance of an indigent institutionalized parent. The lower appellate court reversed a trial court judgment in the State's favor. The court reversed both decisions. The court held that the claim asserted by the State of California did not create a continuing obligation after respondent became domiciled in Texas. The court decided to treat the limitation in the foreign statute as substantive and held that the four-year limitations period in that statute applied. Because the statutory requirement of support did not run counter to good morals or natural justice or appear prejudicial to the general interest of the citizens of Texas, the court held that enforcement of the statute was not against public policy. Accordingly, the court found that California was entitled to judgment for the sum of money charged while the son was a citizen of that state within four years of the commencement of suit.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the state was not entitled to judgment for the amount it sought, as such payments would destroy the trust and thwart the testatrix's intention to provide for the patient's present and future support and maintenance.

Civ. Stat. Ann.  art. 8307, &sect; 4, was unconstitutional because it failed to provide for due process of law and that the statute was invalid because it failed to provide for judicial review. The court reversed the judgment. The court opined that notice and opportunity to defend were matters of right, but that such rights could have been implied from the terms of a statute without being expressly and explicitly set forth in detail. The court explained that when the word &quot;hearing&quot; was used in a statute which attempted to confer jurisdiction to determine whether the property of one person shall be taken and given to another, it necessarily implied as a matter of law that the hearing was to be one of which reasonable notice was given to the parties and at which they would have an opportunity to appear and present any defense which they might have against such taking.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Civil Appeals at Fort Worth (Texas), presented certified questions to the court concerning the constitutionality of a statute authorizing the forfeiture of a vehicle, that was used in the commission of an illegal act, Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 725d. The state had appealed from the trial court's decision, which ruled that the legislature did not have the authority to take the vehicle of defendant, who had no knowledge of the crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state brought an action against defendant to confiscate his vehicle pursuant to art. 725d because the vehicle was used by another to transport narcotics. Defendant denied any knowledge or complicity of the offense. The court, reviewing the constitutionality of art. 725d, noted that the statute required the forfeiture of all vehicles used in the transport of narcotics, regardless of whether the owner had knowledge of the crime, excepting only lienholders and common carriers. The court determined that because the legislature specifically excepted only lienholders and common carriers, it intended art. 725d to require the forfeiture of the property rights of innocent persons. The court further ruled that art. 725d did not violate defendant's constitutional right to due process because the statute was a reasonable regulation within the legislature's police powers, and was related to its stated purpose to curb illegal transportation of narcotics.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled that the statute authorizing the forfeiture of defendant's vehicle was constitutional, and therefore, not void.</SPAN></P>

Respondent attempted to question the electors as to the candidate for whom they cast their ballots, but the trial court refused to compel the witnesses to testify. The appellate court reversed. The court affirmed and remanded to the trial court for retrial. The court rejected petitioner's argument that Tex. Elec. Code Ann. art. 7.14, &sect; 23, which stated that a voter could be compelled to testify as to the candidate for whom he voted, was unconstitutional because it impaired the right to a secret ballot. Although electors had a right to a secret ballot, certain public interests outweighed an individual's right to have his ballot kept secret. The votes cast by illegal electors could not be counted in the final results of an election. Therefore, it was necessary to show for whom an illegal elector had voted. While legal voters could not be compelled to testify how they voted, illegal voters did not enjoy the same privilege.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original proceeding for mandamus instituted by plaintiff, the San Antonio River Authority (the district), against defendant attorney general, the district sought to compel the attorney general to approve an issue of $ 1,000,000 of the district's revenue bonds. The district voters had approved the issuance of $ 10,000,000 in bonds to pay for a flood control project, and the district had authorized the issuance of the first $ 1,000,000 bonds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters authorized the Commissioners Court of Bexar County to collect a tax for flood control purposes. The district contracted with the commissioners court to carry out a flood control program. The attorney general claimed that the commissioners court had no authority to enter into the contract to assess the tax for a term of 30 years because such a contract deprived the voters of the right to change the tax amount by subsequent elections pursuant to Tex. Stat. Ann. art. 7048(a) &sect; 7. The court issued the writ, holding that the attorney general should have approved the bonds. From the powers expressly given to engage in flood control programs and to expend money therefor, the law implied the power to use the general credit of the county to accomplish the desired end. Thus, the commissioners court had the power to contract on the county's general credit to further a flood control program, which might have taken a number of years to execute and might have involved the general credit of the county for such period. The voters' right to repeal the tax was limited by the commissioners court authority to contract, which could not be impaired by a subsequent reduction of the tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the writ of mandamus should issue, compelling the attorney general to approve the issuance of the bonds.</SPAN></P>

Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5154g &sect; 6 was primarily a statute for deciding the forum in which and the judge before whom the labor action should be brought. Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1995 &sect; 17a provided that a suit for substitution of a judge had to be brought within five days of service of process of the action, so the motion for substitution was timely filed. However, the legislative history and the words of the statute itself limited the substitution of judges to those actions seeking injunctive relief only. Because the employer's action sought both an injunction and damages, Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1995 &sect; 17a was inapplicable and the request for mandamus was denied.</SPAN></P>

The purchaser filed a claim seeking a judgment restraining and enjoining the storeowner from further violations of Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 1111m, known as the Sales Limitation Act. On appeal, the court agreed with the conclusion of the trial court that the Act was unconstitutional. The court found that there was no reasonable basis for applying the provisions of the Act to grocery stores and exempting non-grocery stores that sold grocery items. The court reasoned that the purpose of the Act was the protection of the named groups in the ordinary purchase and sale of commodities.

By a supplemental answer filed during the trial of the case, the owner attacked the constitutionality of certain portions of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 7880-3c, and the trial court upheld the statute. The court held, however, that the appeal did not present any of these questions for determination by the court and that the court did not have jurisdiction of a direct appeal simply because a statute was assailed on constitutional grounds in the trial court. The court held further that the board of the district was not a state board or commission within the meaning of Tex. Rev. Civ.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court upheld the constitutionality of Tex. Rev. Civ.

The trial court did not err in upholding the constitutionality of the Act. Appellants attacked part of the Act, which stated that its provisions did not apply to any district until the Act was adopted by qualified voters owning property that had been duly rendered on the tax roll &quot;of the county.&quot; Appellants argued that the Act may have been adopted by a majority vote of the qualified voters of the district who owned no property in the district, but who owned property within the county outside the district that had been rendered for taxation on the rolls of the county. The record disclosed that the propositions respecting the levy of a maintenance tax and the issuance of bonds were approved only by voters who met the requirements of the Act and the Texas Constitution. A provision of the Act was void, but the Act did not fall because of such provision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employer filed an action against the union seeking damages, a restraining order, and temporary and permanent injunctions. The purpose of the injunctive relief was to prohibit the picketing activities of the union. The trial court granted a temporary injunction enjoining the union from picketing at the construction sites, from publishing any statement to the effect that the employer's trucks were being driven by strike breakers, and from using insulting or threatening language to the employer's employees who continued to work. The appellate court affirmed the judgment. On further appeal, the court reformed the judgment and modified the temporary injunction and, as so reformed and modified, affirmed. One isolated reference to an employee as a &quot;scab&quot; did not warrant the temporary injunction prohibiting the insulting language. The banner that the union displayed regarding the drivers of the employer's trucks did not warrant an injunction, as the language on the banner was not false. The union was improperly enjoined from having its pickets accompany employer trucks to job sites, but it was properly enjoined from picketing at, on, or near the premises of neutral contractors.</SPAN></P>

The county was also authorized to issue negotiable bonds secured only by the fund created from the collection of these fees. A majority of the voters of the county voted in favor of placing the Act into operation, but when the county issued bonds under the Act, the attorney general claimed that the Act was unconstitutional. The court agreed with the attorney general and held that the Act was unconstitutional in that it violated Tex. Const. art. 8, &sect; 3, which provided that taxes had to be levied and collected by general laws. The court explained that the Act was unconstitutional because it obtained its authority from the local taxpayers of the county and not from the taxing power of the State of Texas.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner county filed an application for a writ of mandamus to compel respondent, the state Attorney General, to approve bonds that the county proposed to issue under Acts of the 54th Tex. Legislature, ch. 382 (1955). The Act permitted the county to collect one-third of the vehicle registration fee and to apply it to state and federal highway revenues. The Attorney General argued that the Act violated Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Acts of the 54th Tex. Legislature, ch. 382 (1955), whenever a person in the county registered a motor vehicle, the county's tax collector was empowered to collect an additional sum equal to one-third the registration fee. The resulting fund was applied to acquire rights of way for state and federal highways in the county. The state's Attorney General refused to approve bonds secured by the fund on the ground that the statute violated Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3, which required taxes to be levied and collected by general laws. The county filed an application for a writ of mandamus to compel the Attorney General to approve the bonds. The court distinguished monies collected for the purpose of regulation from those collected for the purpose of revenue. The former were exercises of the police power; the latter were taxes. The court explained that the Act attempted to use the police power for the purpose of raising revenue. In fact, the Act imposed a tax. Because the state constitution required taxes to be levied and collected by general laws only, the legislature's attempt to levy a local tax violated the state constitution. The court denied the county's application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the Act, which allowed one county to collect one-third of the vehicle registration fee and apply it to state and federal highway revenues, violated the Texas Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility applied to the city to increase its gas rates. The city refused the increase and the utility appealed to the commission.

The utility brought an action against the commission and the city intervened. The district court granted summary judgment to the utility and enjoined enforcement of the new rates. The commission and the city brought a direct appeal. The court held that the commission was required to use a physical property valuation base rate, rather than a rate based on the &quot;prudent investment theory,&quot; because such an approach was proper under state law. Before the commission could fix a proper rate for the utility, it was required to determine the present fair value of the property used by and useful to the utility in its public service. Because the district court had not tested the rate set by the commission against any finding of fact as to what the fair value of the utility's property was, so as to determine if the rate was confiscatory, summary judgment was not proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order granting summary judgment to the utility and remanded for further findings of fact against which the commission's new rates would be tested.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor employed a subcontractor to work on a construction project. The subcontractor did not employ union members to work on the project or pay union wages to its employees. The union picketed the work site to object to the subcontractor's practices but the signs carried by the picketers targeted the contractor and suggested that the contractor was acting in violation of the union members' rights. The trial court entered a temporary injunction to bar the picketing and the appellate court dissolved the injunction on the basis that it infringed upon the freedom of speech guaranteed to the union by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The court reinstated the decision of the trial court because the allegations and the prayer in the petition were broad enough to support an injunction against secondary picketing and a secondary boycott. Nothing in the record indicated any power on the contractor's part to regulate the subcontractor's employment practices. Further, there was no complaint that the contractor paid its own employees less than the union wage scale or that their hours and working conditions did not conform to union standards.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found that the taxpayers had paid a tax on citrus under the Texas Citrus Commission Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 1451 (1951), which was subsequently held to be unconstitutional by the state supreme court. The court affirmed the court of appeals holding that the taxpayers paid the tax by reason of an Act that was so burdensome and onerous as to justify the trial court's belief that the taxpayers paid the taxes under duress. The State contended that it should not be compelled to refund the taxes because they were spent for the purposes of the Act, which purposes were for the benefit of respondents and not for the benefit of the State as a whole. The court found that the suit did not involve the constitutionality of the Act, but was one for the recovery of taxes paid under the Act, which had been declared unconstitutional. The court held that the controlling fact in the case was that these taxes had been paid under duress of an unconstitutional Act.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen contended that a certain rate ordinance would result in a return to it of less than two percent of the fair value of its properties that were employed in its business. The return was based on the citizen's telephone exchange that furnished local call service to subscribers both within and without the city limits. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment that denied the citizen a temporary injunction. The court reversed the appellate court's judgment and held that the failure of the rates to produce a fair return on the fair value of the properties was an enjoinable violation of constitutional guarantees, although there was no &quot;confiscation&quot; in the sense of an out-of-pocket loss. The court held that a return of less than two percent qualified as unreasonable under the economic conditions and under the proof that was made at the trial. The exchange rate system was the legal and most natural and convenient form of operation thus the rates and returns should be determined on the same basis. There was no room for a discretionary error as to the citizen's chances of final success because the citizen's evidence on the return percentage stood uncontradicted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellee school district board of trustees entered an order integrating white and Negro students in its elementary schools, appellants sought to prohibit the board and appellees, school district superintendent, state commissioner of education, and comptroller of public accounts, from using public funds for teachers in integrated schools. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that: (1) while Tex. Const. art. VII, &sect; 7 and Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2900 were held unconstitutional as far as they required the segregation in public schools, they were not necessarily void as applied to funding for teachers; and (2) Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2922 did not prohibit the use of public funds in integrated schools by its language providing for the allotment of funds to the schools on the basis of attendance by white and Negro students to their respective segregated schools because there was nothing in the statute requiring segregation, and there was nothing in applicable case law nullifying the state statute directing that white and Negro students be enumerated separately to determine the number of teachers a school district was entitled to.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the trial court's exclusion of evidence that showed the amount of taxable bank deposits omitted from the tax rolls was error that required a reversal of judgment. The court held that the bank deposits were subject to taxation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that no provision of the Texas Constitution prohibited the legislature from creating a governmental agency and body politic and giving it the powers specified in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6674v, &sect; 5f. The Act provided that bonds issued did constitute a debt or the pledging of the faith and credit of the state or of any political subdivision but were payable solely from a fund derived from revenues. So, Tex. Const. art. 3, &sect;&sect; 49, 50, and 52b were not violated. Under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6674v, &sect; 8, the Authority had the power to condemn public and private property. Even if the advancement of funds called for in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6674v, &sect; 20 violated Tex.

The Highway Commissioners served as directors of the Toll Road Authority without compensation and the office was not one of emolument, so Tex. Const. art. 16, &sect; 40 was not violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax assessor-collector had performed duties imposed on him by art. 1436-1, &sect; 57. Before the tax assessor-collector had been paid any compensation provided for in art. 1436-1, &sect; 57, the attorney general gave an opinion that the provision was constitutional and that payment to the tax assessor-collector was in all things proper and legal. The tax assessor-collector filed a motion for reconsideration of the court's opinion that allowed the county to recover repayment from the tax assessor-collector of the compensation paid under art. 1436-1, &sect; 57, which the court held unconstitutional. On reconsideration, the court found that the parties had acted in good faith and that it was inequitable to have required the tax assessor-collector to repay the compensation. The rule that an unconstitutional law was a nullity did not apply to work hardship and impose liability on a public official who, in performance of duty, had acted in good faith relying on the validity of a statute before it had been declared invalid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tax-paying real property owners appealed from a judgment of a trial court (Texas) allowing defendant San Jacinto County Water Control and Improvement District No. 1 to sell $ 50,000 worth of bonds to use the proceeds to construct a sewer disposal system under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 7880-3a. Article 7880-3a delegated to the District the power to install a sanitary and storm sewer disposal system financed by tax supported bonds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The only issue in the direct appeal by the owners was the constitutionality of a portion of art. 7880-3a. The delegation of power in art. 7880-3a was allegedly unauthorized by the Texas Constitution. The owners sought an injunction to prevent the expenditure of the money contending that the powers conferred by art. 7880-3a were not authorized by Tex. Const. art. 3, &sect; 52 or Tex. Cons. art. 16, &sect; 59a, and for that reason Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 7880-3a was unconstitutional. The owners' attack failed because the power to erect and operate a sewage disposal plant was clearly within Tex. Const. art. 16, &sect; 59a. The water brought into the area by the district was not destroyed by use but must have been returned to the hydrological cycle. The Conservation Amendment to the Texas Constitution would have permitted the purification of water before it returned to the groundwater table and the river system. The protection of the purity of Texas waters was a public right and duty under the Amendment. Tex. Penal Code arts. 698b, 1362 and Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 4444 plainly declared the pollution of public waters to have been against Texas public policy and provided appropriate sanctions.</SPAN></P>

The county argued that the additional compensation violated Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 61 (1948). The trial court agreed with the county, but the civil appeals court reversed. On appeal from the civil appeals court, the court held that the trial court had jurisdiction even though the attorney general was not made a party to the proceeding under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, specifically, Tex.

The court found that there was substantial compliance with &sect; 11 and noted that the attorney general had been notified of the action and had chosen not to participate. The court further held that the trial court had jurisdiction to determine the issues involved without the joinder of all counties and tax collectors whose interests were incidentally affected under &sect; 11. Additionally, the court held that Tex. Penal Code art. 1436-1, &sect; 57 was unconstitutional in that it allowed the collector to receive a fee dependent upon his collections.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The turnpike companies were private corporations that built, acquired, operated, and maintained toll roads within the state. When the state turnpike authority was created, the turnpike companies sought to transfer their assets to the state. Under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6674v, &sect; 18 their conveyances were placed in escrow. The escrow agent would deliver the instrument to the authority upon compliance with the requirements set forth in &sect; 18. The turnpike companies maintained that the property in escrow was exempt from taxation. The trial court ruled that the property was exempt, but the intermediary court reversed the trial court. On appeal, the court held that the state owned neither the legal nor the equitable title. The right of the state, as grantee, to acquire title was dependent upon the performance of conditions. Thus, the state merely held a right to become the owner of the legal title under certain conditions. Its interest in the property was not a vested interest. Because the property was not tax exempt, the court found that art. 6674v was not unconstitutional on the ground that it conferred tax-exempt status.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that: (1) the water district was a governmental agency and political body governed by the law applicable to counties; (2) no liability could result because there was no statute making the water district liable in such a case; and (3) there was also no property damage to create liability on the part of the water district.</SPAN></P>

They introduced two judgments, each of which disclosed that the identical issues had been decided in their favor in each judgment. The suits were between the same parties except that other bondsmen were intervenors in the instant case. Notice of appeal was given from both judgments, but appeal was not perfected. In sustaining the plea in abatement the trial court did not reach the question of the constitutionality of art. 277, &sect; 2. Therefore the question presented to the court was not whether the statute was constitutional but whether the trial court erred in sustaining a plea in abatement upon res judicata. The court declined to pass upon the question of whether or not the trial court correctly sustained the plea in abatement. The court had no jurisdiction over a direct appeal from an order of the District Court sustaining a plea of res judicata and not passing upon the constitutionality of the statute. The appeal was dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the beginning of the fourth year of a lease of farmland, the tenant paid only one-half of the agreed upon rent. He planted cotton and his efforts yielded seven bales of cotton. The creditor, acting on a promissory note, attached the bales, and the landlord's heirs intervened asserting a landlord's lien on the bales. The trial court granted summary judgment holding that the landlord's lien was superior to the creditor's lien. The intermediate appellate court reversed the trial court judgment and rendered summary judgment that the creditor's lien prevailed. The court reversed both judgments and remanded the case for trial because there were fact issues to be resolved before judgment could be rendered in favor of any party. The court held that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5222 created statutory landlord's liens, but that an exception might have applied, depending upon what crops were raised on the land, and the value thereof. If the only crop was grain or cotton, and the value was enough over the rental to satisfy the statutory percentages, then there would have been a lien.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district moved to dismiss the appeal on the theory that Tex. R. Civ. P. 499-a did not authorize it. The court found that there was no language in the rule indicating that the state board or commission issuing an order had to be a party to the suit in order for the direct appeal to lie and overruled the motion to dismiss. The court further found that although a portion of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7880-3a had been found to be unconstitutional, the remainder of the article was separable because it did not appear that the legislature would not have enacted the section without the offending provision, or that the remainder did not present an independent, complete and workable whole without it. The court also found that the trial court's judgment granting the injunction against the sale of the bonds and the levy of the tax by the directors of the district was based entirely on its conclusion that an order of the State Board of Water Engineers was invalid. Contrary to the residents' argument, the court concluded that such board had jurisdiction to hear and grant petitions because the property in the district was in two or more counties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The shareholder refused to subscribe to stock until the corporate charter was filed.

The court held that the incorporators' action in returning their stock and withdrawing corporate funds to repay their individual loans stripped the corporation of sufficient funds with which to operate. This action violated the incorporators' duty to the corporation, which action the shareholder was entitled to have set aside. The incorporators were liable for the return of corporate assets appropriated by them for their own individual use. Because the bank knew of this fiduciary violation when it was repaid the loan, it was also liable. There was no evidence to support an individual cause of action against the bank, but there was evidence to support the shareholder's individual action against the incorporators and the issues should have been submitted to the jury.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. art. 7880-3c required appellees to commence their action within a reasonable time. The court found that appellees stood by for seven months before filing their action and that during that time knew that the county took steps to establish the water district. The court also found that appellees tacitly recognized the existence of the water district by having their representatives meet with the water district's directors. The court concluded that appellees could have filed and prosecuted the instant action immediately after the order designating the subdivision was entered and that their delay of seven months in filing the suit was unreasonable under all the attending facts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state education agency appealed the judgment of the Third District Court of Civil Appeals (Texas), which reversed the ruling of a trial court in favor of the agency, in an action brought by respondent school district to compel the agency to consider the area of a certain military reservation as part of the district, entitling the district to a resulting credit of funds on a certain program that it financed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2756b empowered the state board of education to either establish a school district within a military reservation or include the reservation within any other school district. The board attached Fort Bliss Military Reservation to the district, at a time when the reservation contained an area of 8.98 square miles. After the size of the reservation expanded, including areas then within other school districts, the board issued an order including the entire reservation within the district. When the agency refused to credit the district some $ 315,000 in state funds as a result, thereof, the district sued the agency to compel the agency to recognize the reservation as part of the district, and to issue the monetary credit. The trial court ruled in favor of the agency; the intermediate appellate court reversed that decision. On appeal, the court affirmed the intermediate court's decision. The court held that the board's action was proper because the Act was clear and unambiguous; authorized the board to transfer territory of a military reservation from one school district to another; and did not violate any state or federal constitutional provision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Civil Appeals for the Fourth District (Texas) certified questions in a motor vehicle negligence action filed under Tex. Penal Code art. 827a, &sect; 9-a by appellant motorists against appellee truck owners, asking if the motorists had the right to attack Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 6701d, &sect; 138 as unconstitutional and whether art. 6701d, &sect; 138 was unconstitutional and repealed Tex. Penal Code art. 827a, &sect; 9-a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The last question certified was whether Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 6701d, &sect; 138 applied to the case facts as a rule of civil conduct. The motorists alleged that the truck owners had left a truck tractor standing on the highway without its head lamps on, violating Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 6701d, &sect; 121, and improperly placed a flare, in violation of Tex. Penal Code art. 871a, &sect; 9-a. The truck owners argued that its plea of privilege was properly upheld because the motorists did not prove that any crime that was a basis for civil liability was committed or that the alleged crimes proximately caused the accident. The court held that the motorists had the right to attack Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 6701d, &sect; 138 because it could be a rule of civil conduct and a party whose rights were affected by the operation of a statute had the right to question its constitutionality. The Highway Traffic Act was a comprehensive law considered to be both a civil and criminal statute. Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 6701d, &sect; 138 was inconsistent with the penal code and it repealed Tex. Penal Code art. 827, &sect; 9-a. Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 6701d, &sect; 138 was a rule of civil conduct in this case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the questions certified for review. The motorists had a right to attack the traffic regulation statute, which was considered a rule of civil conduct in the case. The traffic regulation statute conflicted with and repealed the penal statute.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the subject matter of the ordinance was legislative in character and had not been withdrawn, either expressly or impliedly, by the general laws, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1269m, &sect; 8, or the city charter, from the field in which the initiatory process was operative. Petitioners were not permitted to refuse to perform purely ministerial duties on the ground that, in their opinion, the ordinance would be invalid if adopted. The court overruled McCarty v. Jarvis, 96 S.W.2d 564, to the extent that its holding conflicted with the holding in the case.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the employees, and the appellate court reversed the judgment. The court affirmed the appellate court's decision. The court found that the constitutional amendment that created the teacher retirement system was not intended to extend its benefits to anyone but teachers, and to suppose that it was intended to give teachers credit for prior service in another field of public service was to ignore the amendment's purpose. The court held that the constitutional amendment that created the employees retirement system was not intended to include teachers.

The ex-husband did not appear or appeal. The ex-husband argued that the Minnesota judgments were not final because, under Minnesota law, a trial court had the continuing power to modify the alimony. The court held that: (1) the ex-wife's petition was not a suit for recovery of past due installments under the original judgment but for recovery on two supplemental judgments, each of which determined the amount of installments past due, awarded recovery of that amount, and ordered execution; (2) the question regarding the finality of the supplemental judgments was a different question from that of the finality of past due installments awarded by an original decree of divorce that had not been reduced to judgment for a sum certain and made presently payable; and (3) the Minnesota judgments were unconditional, valid, and final and should be given effect in Texas by awarding the ex-wife the same amount that the Minnesota court awarded her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Board of Insurance Commissioners of Texas (Board) sought review of an order from the Court of Civil Appeals for the Fifth District (Texas), which reversed the decision from the trial court in favor of respondents, carrier and trustee, and held that none of the purported group insurance policies issued by the carrier to employees of banks having less than 25 employees was in violation of Tex. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4764a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the Board contended that &sect; 4764a applied to all of the policies and that such policies were in violation of that statute, as the statute prohibited the writing of group insurance for employers with fewer than 25 employees. As an initial matter, the court held that all of the instruments involved in the transaction were to be considered in determining the nature of the contract between the parties and that the court was not limited by the rule of strict construction in interpreting the statute. The court then found that the policies were group insurance within the meaning of &sect; 4764a, noting that the parties conceded that the policies invaded the field of group insurance. The court, however, agreed that such policies were in violation of the statute, as each of the policies related to employees of an bank with less than the requisite number of employees. The court concluded by rejecting as meritless the attack upon the constitutionality of &sect; 4764a, finding that the designations of the classes made beneficiaries of the statute's provisions were not arbitrary, but rather reflected a reasonable state interest in regulating the writing of life insurance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state brought a quo warranto action against respondents, county school trustees, to have their order creating a rural high school district by annexing several school districts declared void. The Court of Civil Appeals for the Ninth District (Texas) affirmed the lower court's ruling that the consolidated rural high school district was legally created, and that the trustees were its lawful officers. The state sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state contended that the trustees' order was invalid because there was no statutory authorization for the creation of rural high school districts by annexation of one or more districts to another district. The state further argued that in no event could a common school district with a scholastic population of more than 250 be annexed to an independent school district having a scholastic population of 250 or more. The state further argued that the trustees were without authority to remove one of the consolidated district's status as an independent district. The court agreed with these claims and reversed the lower court's judgment. The court held that from a careful analysis of all of the articles within Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat., tit. 49, ch.19A, the legislature did not expressly provide for the creation of rural school districts by annexation. The court further held that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2922a did not provide a second method of forming rural high school districts, as contended by the trustees, but that it merely provided a second method of providing for better and stronger rural schools, and there was no authority for reading such language into this article.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a quo warranto action, the court reversed the lower court's judgment that upheld the trustees' creation of a rural high school district by annexing several school districts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the oil companies filed the mandamus action, litigation was pending in the United States Supreme Court wherein the United States claimed ownership of the area in the Gulf of Mexico that had been leased to the oil companies by the State of Texas. The oil companies had paid the annual rental on the submerged lands, under protest, based on the state officials' threats to foreclose their oil and gas leaseholds. The oil companies contended that their obligations to pay rentals was suspended under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 5421-i to based on the litigation by the United States to recover title to the submerged lands and minerals. The court agreed and ordered the state officials to refund the rentals paid under protest. While the mandamus action was pending, the federal litigation ended with a judgment in favor of the United States. Thus, the State had no authority to execute the oil and gas leases to the oil companies. The court found that art. 5421-i, suspending the oil companies' obligations, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted a temporary injunction and refused the trade council's request to grant a permanent injunction. The intermediate appellate court reversed the trial court's decision, holding that fixing the prevailing wage was reviewable by the courts under the &quot;substantial evidence rule&quot;, and remanded the cause to the trial court. On appeal, the court reversed the intermediate appellate court's decision. The court held that the power to determine the prevailing wage was delegated to the commission and no mode of revising the decision, by appeal or otherwise, was provided by law, thus the commission's action was final and conclusive. Therefore, the commission's determination of the prevailing wage was not reviewable and the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the case.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that the landowners' daughter ran the school with them as part of a partnership for two years. The court concluded that the taxpayers were not entitled to an exemption for the two years in question because in order to be exempt the building had to be owned by those who used it as a school, and the daughter was not an owner.

The district court granted an injunction in the State's action to prohibit the fisherman from using their shrimp boats. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that Tex.

The quota system, limiting the number of boats, would not necessarily to limit the amount of &quot;edible aquatic life&quot; taken and there was no distinction between the types of aquatic lives to be protected and how much of each type was permissible.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the request of the developer, the city amended the basic zoning ordinance previously adopted by the city and changed a particular block from a single family residence district to an apartment house district.

The trial court annulled the ordinance and permanently enjoined the city and the developer from taking action based on the ordinance. An appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment. On appeal, the court reversed the appellate court and concluded that the amendatory ordinance, as a form of &quot;spot zoning,&quot; was void. There was no substantial evidence to justify the change in the zoning classification of the particular block, and the evidence was undisputed that the change did not bear any substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. The court found, as a matter of law, that the unjustifiable spot zoning constituted an abuse of discretion by the city and that the amendatory ordinance was arbitrary and unreasonable.

The court also found that the act distinguished between counties that bordered with Mexico and those that did not. The court concluded that there was no valid reason for such a distinction. The act was found to be condemned by Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 56 and therefore invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner union representatives sought review of a judgment from the Court of Civil Appeals for the Seventh District (Texas), which affirmed a trial court's judgment in favor of respondent business owner, permanently enjoining the union representatives from picketing the premises where the business owner was conducting work.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business owner operated a house-moving business and none of his crew members belonged to a union. An election was held and his employees voted not to join a union. When the business owner was conducted a job out-of-town, the union representatives picketed the premises because of the business owner's refusal to use union members for the job. The business owner brought suit, alleging that the purpose of the picketing was to force him to hire only union members and to compel his crew to join unions, and that no labor dispute existed under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 5154f to justify picketing. The trial court granted a permanent injunction in favor of the business owner. An appellate court affirmed. On further appeal, the court held that the injunction was proper because the picketing was for an unlawful purpose of trying to force the business owner to use only union members to the detriment of nonunion workers. The court noted that the injunction could not be supported on the ground that a &quot;labor dispute&quot; did not exist under art. 5154f because that statute had been held to be in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment of the trial court to eliminate the requirement that a labor dispute among a majority of employees and union members must exist before picketing would be allowed and, as modified, affirmed the judgments of the trial court and the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the probate court had been validly created and denied the State's request for relief. Without writing an opinion, the Court of Civil Appeals for the First District (Texas) certified a question to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The certified question was whether Tex. Const. art. V authorized the Legislature of Texas to create the Probate Court of Harris County, as provided by H.B. 677, 51st Leg., Reg. Sess. (Act). The State alleged that the Act violated Tex. Const. art. V, &sect;&sect; 15, 16, and 22 in that &sect; 2 of the Act gave the probate court general jurisdiction that was concurrent with the county court. The State argued that Tex. Const. art. V, &sect;&sect; 15, 16 vested exclusive jurisdiction in probate matters to the county court and that &sect; 22 prohibited the legislature from changing the probate jurisdiction of the county court. The court held that: (1) the Act did not undertake to limit or take away the jurisdiction of the county court; (2) the Act simply provided for another court to share the burdens and jurisdiction of the county court; (3) the Act provided how pending and future cases would be divided between the two courts; (4) no provision of the state's constitution prohibited the Act, so the answer to the certified question was &quot;yes&quot;; and (5) by virtue of Tex. R. Civ. P. 515, the right to file a motion for rehearing was denied.</SPAN></P>

In upholding the invalidation, the appeals court held the ordinance had discriminated between respondent bus owner and a franchised competitor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After deciding that better and safer service could be given by a bus line operating under a franchise granted by the town, the town passed an ordinance restricting buses without a franchise to certain locations. Pursuant to the ordinance, the town granted a franchise to the bus owner's competitor. With the bus owner restricted to receiving and discharging passengers only at certain points named in the ordinance, the bus owner brought an action against the town, claiming the ordinance was discriminatory. When the trial court and the appeals court invalidated the ordinance, the town sought review, and the court reversed. After noting the town had the power to regulate the use of its streets, that court held the ordinance had not been rendered unconstitutional by the fact that private rights had been subjected to restraint because the foundation of the police power was control of private interests for public welfare. In finding the ordinance had not been passed to restrict the bus owner's business but to prevent dangerous hazards, the court held that the ordinance was reasonable and that it had not been passed in bad faith or for discriminatory purposes.</SPAN></P>

The trial court issued a judgment declaring 1182a, &sect; 3 constitutional, and the appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment. On appeal, the court reversed the appellate court. The court ruled that 1182a, &sect; 3 was constitutional because it did not grant special privileges or immunities to property owners in the annexed lands in violation of Tex. Const. art.

At the request of the business owner, the trial court entered a restraining order, and later a permanent injunction, prohibiting the picketing. An appellate court affirmed holding that a &quot;labor dispute&quot; did not exist. On further appeal, the court reversed both judgments, concluding that Tex. Rev. Civ.

The court held that the ordinance was invalid because the city's charter required the council to assume the responsibility of selecting a new member and did not give the council authority to delegate this power to the electorate. Despite the invalidity, the court held that it was beyond judicial power to enjoin the election or the payment of any expenses which were incident to the election.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator surface property owners filed a writ of mandamus proceeding to compel respondent commissioner of the general land office (commissioner) to receive, file, and recognize an oil and gas lease with an oil company as validly executed by the surface property owners as agents for the state under the terms of the Relinquishment Act. The surface property owners asserted that the commissioner erred in finding that its rights were terminated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minerals under the surface property owners' land were reserved to the state at the time the land was patented to them, but admittedly the relinquishment Act applied to the premises, which entitled the surface property owners, at least under ordinary conditions, to make leases of the oil and gas on behalf of the state as its agent. When the original oil company lessee voluntarily surrendered it lease, which was duly filed with and accepted by the commissioner, the surface property owners entered into a new lease agreement with another oil company. However, the commissioner refused to file this new lease or to accept payment claiming the surface owners' rights were terminated by failure to drill an offset in accordance with Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5370. The surface property owners asserted that the commissioner erred in finding their rights were terminated and filed a writ of mandamus to compel the commissioner to accept the new lease as valid. The court refused to grant the surface owners a writ of mandamus, holding that the surface owners' agency terminated by operation of the statute prior to the execution of the oil and gas company lease.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the surface property owners' writ of mandamus to compel the commissioner to accept its oil and gas lease as valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, chairman of the board of trustees of the Texas Teachers Retirement System (board), sought review of a judgment from the Court of Civil Appeals (Texas) that affirmed the issuance of a writ of mandamus in favor of appellee beneficiary to compel the board to pay the beneficiary the annuities accumulated to the credit of his deceased aunt based on her designation of him as her &quot;nominee&quot; to receive under a teachers' retirement system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A mandamus action brought by the designated beneficiary of the annuity rights of his deceased aunt, who was eligible to retire under the Teachers Retirement Act of 1937 (Act), ch. 470, 1937 Tex. Acts 1178, as amended ch. 376, 1941 Tex. Acts 610. The court of civil appeals affirmed a judgment issuing a writ of mandamus to compel the board to pay the beneficiary the annuities accumulated to the credit of his aunt, pursuant to Option 1 of &sect;5(7) of the Act. The court reversed the judgment. Though the deceased had withdrawn from service in 1939, it was not until August 19, 1941, that she attempted to select the optional settlement and designated August 31, 1941, as the effective date of her retirement. She died on September 3, 1941, which was less than 30 days from either the date of the application or the date designated for retirement and before a retirement allowance had been granted or any payment thereon became &quot;normally due.&quot; Because the deceased was an active member at the time of her death, only the amount of accumulated contributions credited to her individual account were payable to the beneficiary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgments of both the trial court and court of civil appeals, and judgment was rendered refusing to issue the writ of mandamus to compel the board to pay the beneficiary the annuities accumulated to the credit of his deceased aunt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Texas Railroad Commission sought review of a judgment from the 98th District Court of Travis County (Texas), which declared invalid an order issued by the Commission concerning plaintiff oil producers' waste of gas residue and enjoined the Commission from enforcing the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission's order prohibited the production of either oil or gas from a specified field until the oil producers made the residue gas from such production available for one or more of the lawful uses identified in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 6008, &sect; 7(1). The oil producers had been flaring the residue gas for many years, constituting a waste of natural rescues. The oil producers had found a purchaser for the residue gas but had failed to install the compressors required to transport it into the pipeline after several years of negotiations. The trial court determined that the Commission's order was invalid. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that it had jurisdiction on direct appeal under Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 3-b to consider the question of law of whether there was substantial evidence to support the Commission's order. The court overruled the oil producers' motion to dismiss the appeal and determined that the Commission's flare-gas order, pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 6029, was fair and reasonable. It was reasonably supported by substantial evidence that the oil producers' flaring rendered the casinghead gas useless and violated Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 6008.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a police department and a fire department, challenged the decision of the Court of Civil Appeals for the Second District (Texas), which found in favor of plaintiff city and ruled that the Firemen's and Policemen's Civil Service Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 1269m, &sect; 18, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city filed an action against the fire and police departments and challenged the constitutionality of the Firemen's and Policemen's Civil Service Act. The trial court found that the Firemen's and Policemen's Civil Service Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 1269m, &sect; 18, was unconstitutional. On review, the court found that the provision was in regards to judicial review of a decision to suspend or terminate a fireman or policeman. The court found that &sect; 18 would not allow the trial court to substitute its judgment for that of the city regarding disciplinary procedures. The Act specifically provided the acts of misconduct that would constitute grounds for dismissal. Furthermore, the standard of review was limited to whether there was substantial evidence to support a disciplinary decision. The court concluded that &sect; 18 did not give the trial court power to do any more. Therefore, &sect; 18 of the Act was found to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>
