<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of the Circuit Court in and for Duval County's (Florida) judgment of conviction and death sentence for first-degree felony murder and aggravated child abuse in the death of his girlfriend's five-month-old daughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder during aggravated child abuse of his girlfriend's infant daughter, and sentenced to death. Appellant hid the baby's body in a pond and claimed she had been kidnapped but later confessed, stating he had dropped her while changing her diaper and shaken her trying to revive her, and then panicked. During the penalty phase, the State introduced appellant's prior felony child abuse conviction for shaking another girlfriend's infant. There were statutory aggravators and statutory and nonstatutory mitigators. The court affirmed his convictions and death sentence, but remanded for resentencing on the aggravated child abuse conviction and completion of the sentencing guidelines scoresheet. The trial court's errors, in restricting cross-examination, improper probation aggravator, and improper doubling, were harmless, given the totality of the evidence. He had been properly Mirandized four times and voluntarily confessed. His sentence was not disproportionate, given his record. Premeditation was not proved but was not required, given that aggravated child abuse was an independent felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Convictions and death sentence were affirmed; case was remanded for resentencing on aggravated child abuse. Appellant's confession was voluntary after valid waiver. Trial court's errors were harmless. State did not prove premeditated murder but it did prove first-degree felony murder. Death sentence was proportionate; prior felony child abuse was significant aggravator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant individual was sentenced to death following his conviction for first-degree murder, sexual battery, and burglary (case one).

At all times, appellant was represented by various members of the same law firm that the trial court appointed to represent him. Following his direct appeal in case one, which resulted in the convictions being affirmed, an evidentiary hearing was held on appellant's motion filed pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 claiming ineffectiveness of counsel and conflict issues. At the hearing, appellant decided not to proceed, contending that his attorney-client privilege in case two would have been violated. The trial court ended the hearing, and denied appellant's request for relief. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed, because appellant had waived any attorney-client privilege that existed between himself and trial counsel for case one when he accused counsel of ineffectiveness and conflict of interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant State sought review of the decision of the District Court of Appeal for the Fifth District (Florida) holding that Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee mother was charged with three counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 827.04(1)(a). The trial court granted appellee's motion to dismiss and certified a question to the appellate court whether &sect; 827.04(1)(a) was unconstitutionally vague based on prohibiting conduct, omissions, or a standard of conduct that were not defined. The appellate court answered the certified question in the affirmative and found that &sect; 827.04(1)(a) was unconstitutional. On appeal by appellant State, the court stated that a statute could be constitutional even tough in contained general terms and did not provide specifications of prohibited conduct. Furthermore, the court stated that &sect; 827.04(2) supported a finding that the terms at issue in the case were defined in other specified sections. Therefore, the court held that &sect; 827.04(1)(a) was not unconstitutionally vague. The case was reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded a decision that held that the statute that proscribed contributing to the delinquency of a minor was unconstitutional because the statute was not unconstitutional for vagueness. Deletion of a phrase from the statute did not render the statute constitutionally infirm.</SPAN></P>

P. 3.850, challenging defendant's conviction and sentence of death for first-degree murder. Defendant appealed, arguing numerous errors, including Brady violations by plaintiff State, newly discovered evidence, and ineffective assistance of counsel. The court held plaintiff did not commit Brady violations. A property receipt which defendant claimed would show his jacket could not have been found at the scene of the murder did not demonstrate that two jackets were seized from defendant's girlfriend. Material that defendant claimed could be used to impeach a witness, his former cellmate, did not put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict, as four other witnesses testified that defendant confessed to murdering the victim. The court held the DNA would produce no new evidence. Defendant sought to show his girlfriend was in the room where the murder took place. However, this evidence would in no was exculpate defendant. The court held defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

The purpose of the proposed amendment was to require that Florida Constitution's Cruel or Unusual Punishment Clause to be interpreted in conformity with its federal counterpart, effectively nullifying Florida's clause where it was more strict than the federal clause. The amendment flew under false colors because it may have led citizens to vote in favor of the amendment on the false premise that it would have promoted the basic rights of Florida citizens.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged a judgment, based upon a jury verdict, of the Circuit Court in and for Dade County (Florida) convicting him on two counts of first-degree murder and one count of armed burglary. Appellant was sentenced to death on each murder count and to life in prison on the burglary count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of burglary and two counts of murder after killing two victims in their own home. The State prosecuted the case on the premise that appellant's entry into the victims' home was consensual but that at some point, this consent was withdrawn. Appellant was a business acquaintance of the victims. On appeal, appellant claimed the trial erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on the charges of first-degree murder. Specifically, appellant argued the State's theory of felony murder should not have been presented to the jury. The murder convictions were set aside and the burglary conviction was reversed. In the context of an occupied dwelling, burglary was not intended to cover the situation where an invited guest turns criminal or violent. Rather, burglary was intended to criminalize the conduct of a suspect who terrorizes, shocks, or surprises the unknowing occupants. The conduct of appellant, who's entry into victims' home was consensual, did not amount to burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment was reversed and case remanded; appellant's actions were not the type of conduct which the crime of burglary was intended to punish. The theory of burglary, and felony murder, offered by the State was legally inadequate. Appellant, an invited guest into victims' home, could not be found guilty of burglary even though victims' later withdrew their consent.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 61.13(7), which authorized custody for grandparents if a child was actually residing with a grandparent in a stable relationship, to be unconstitutional, as it infringed upon a natural parent's right to rear his or her child.</SPAN></P>

The child resided off and on with appellant grandmother and her husband. Subsequently, appellee took the child out of state and refused to return with her. Appellant intervened in the custody dispute between the parents under Fla. Stat. ch. 61.13(7). The trial court awarded custody to appellant. The district court reversed on appeal, finding the statute unconstitutional. The court affirmed the district court, holding that the statute was facially unconstitutional in vesting custody rights in others because it violated a natural parent's fundamental right to rear his or her child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants challenged decisions in consolidated case from various district courts of appeal, holding that offense of driving while license canceled, suspended, or revoked under Fla. Stat. ch. 322.34(1) (1995) was constitutional and not a violation of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In each of the cases before the court, the State charged the defendant with at least one felony driving while license cancelled, suspended, or revoked (DWLCSR) offense pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 322.34(1) (1995). The defendants asserted that because a trial court could withhold an adjudication of guilt with regard to a DWLCSR offense, the trial court therefore had the authority to determine whether a third or subsequent DWLCSR offense constituted a misdemeanor or a felony. As the Florida Legislature had the sole authority and responsibility to define the degree of substantive criminal offenses, the defendants asserted, the authority of the trial court to withhold adjudication with regard to a DWLCSR offense unconstitutionally infringed upon the legislature's exclusive authority. It was clear that the Florida Legislature intended that a &quot;conviction&quot; for the purposes of ch. 322.34(1), included both adjudicated DWLCSR offenses and DWLCSR offenses in which adjudication was withheld. The court rejected each defendants' separation of powers challenge to ch. 322.34(1), and approved the result reached by the district courts in each of the decisions under review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted and sentenced to death for the murders of two men. On appeal from denial of his request for postconviction relief, the court affirmed. Appellant's claims that the trial judge, who also presided over the postconviction relief proceedings, was biased were procedurally barred, as they were based upon grounds known of at the time of the direct appeal. Even if the claim of actual bias during trial was not barred, the comments attributed to the trial judge in the original trial were insufficient to show actual impartiality amounting to a denial of appellant's constitutional right to a fair and impartial tribunal. Further, the court found that counsel was not ineffective during the guilt phase for failing impeach a State's witness, for failing to present a voluntary intoxication defense, or for failing to rebut State's arguments that appellant committed the crime due to racial animus, and that counsel during penalty phase was not ineffective for failing to introduce favorable mental health mitigating evidence or other mitigating evidence.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's claims that trial judge was biased were procedurally barred, as claims were based upon judge's statements at trial.

The trial court afforded the mitigating circumstances only &quot;some&quot; or &quot;little&quot; weight. On appeal of the death penalty after resentencing, the court affirmed, finding that appellant waived his right to be present during pretrial conferences; trial court did not err in granting State's motion to compel a mental health examination of appellant, as notice of intent to seek the death penalty was timely; Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.202 was applicable and was not violative of appellant's due process rights; prosecutor's single erroneous comment was not so egregious as to require reversal of the entire resentencing proceeding; and the death penalty was not disproportionate as compared with other capital cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">With appellant's ex-wife's cooperation, the lead investigator in the case made an audio-video recording of a conversation between the ex-wife and appellant. At trial, the court allowed the investigator to testify as to his opinion of appellant's guilt. The appellate court reversed appellant's convictions, finding that it was an impermissible invasion of the province of the jury for the investigator to express his opinion that he had &quot;no doubt&quot; that appellant committed the murders. Further, the impermissible implication was that the investigator obtained some additional knowledge from monitoring the surveillance live that was unavailable to the jury. However, there was no evidence presented to the jury that the investigator had heard some other statement by appellant, not recorded on the videotape, that would lead him to have &quot;no doubt&quot; of appellant's guilt. Additionally by arguing that appellant was arrested because the state's agents who listened to the videotape had no doubt of his guilt, the prosecutor engaged in impermissible bolstering of the state's case by asserting the superior knowledge and certainty of the government's agents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner sought review of the divergent decisions of two district courts in two separate cases involving application of the Prison Releasee Reoffender Punishment Act, Fla.

In one case, the district court affirmed the trial court's decision not to sentence a qualifying defendant under the act as a prison releasee reoffender holding that the trial court and not the state had the discretion whether or not to apply the act. In another case, the district court held that the act did not violate the state constitution's separation of powers clause, and that the state, rather than the trial court, had the discretion whether or not to apply the act. The court held that the state attorney had the authority to determine whether or not to sentence a qualifying defendant under the act. The court also held that the act did not violate the separation of powers clauses of Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3 by establishing a mandatory minimum sentencing scheme, and that the scheme did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner appealed the affirmation by the First District Court of Appeal (Florida), of his conviction for attempted murder and sentence under 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 184 and 1996 Fla. Laws ch. 388. Petitioner's question as to the constitutionality of chapter 184 under Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6's single subject provision, was certified as being of great public importance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The legislature's amended sentencing guidelines in 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 184 and 1996 Fla. Laws ch. 388 became effective in October 1995. While on probation in January 1997, petitioner attempted first-degree premeditated murder with a firearm. The trial court sentenced petitioner under the amended guidelines to a year longer than it could have under the unamended guidelines of Fla. Stat. ch. 921.0011, 921.0012, and 921.0014. Petitioner did not raise a single subject rule objection under Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6, to his sentence. In May 1997 the legislature reenacted the guidelines it had only amended before. The court held that petitioner had standing to raise a single subject challenge for the first time on appeal because his sentence was clearly longer under the amended guidelines, he had appealed prior to a state supreme court decision concerning rules of criminal procedure, and his offense occurred between the guidelines amendments' effective date and the reenactment of the underlying guidelines. Petitioner's sentence was reversed and remanded to be made under the guidelines before the amendments became effective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The certified question was answered affirmatively, and the court quashed the judgment below and remanded because the sentence for an offense committed between the sentencing guidelines amendments' effective date and the reenactment of the underlying statutes was to be made under the unamended guidelines.</SPAN></P>

On remand, the trial court considered appellant's motion but denied relief without a hearing, entering a proposed order submitted by the State without affording appellant the opportunity to raise objections or submit an alternative order. Thus, the court again remanded and ordered the trial court to hold a hearing for the purpose of determining whether an evidentiary hearing was required and to hear legal argument relating to the motion. Judgment affirmed; the trial court had not abused it's discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's order denying appellant's motion because it concluded the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's motion to amend. Appellant's sentence was affirmed on appeal he had been given ample opportunities in the subsequent years to prepare and amend his motion.</SPAN></P>

Despite appellant's delusional belief that he is Jesus Christ, appellant had a factual and rational understanding of the details of his trial, his conviction, and the jury's recommendation by a vote of seven to five that he be sentenced to death and of the fact that in accordance with the jury's recommendation, he was sentenced to death for murder, and that he will die once he is executed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted petitioner's summary judgment motion based on the standing train doctrine. The court affirmed the court of appeals decision, abolishing the doctrine and finding resolution of the case should have been governed by broad standards of negligence. The doctrine should not have been indiscriminately applied in every situation where a car ran into a train. Rather, inquiries into the conditions surrounding the accident had to be made.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue presented was whether Fla. Stat. ch. 924.051(3) (Supp. 1996), enacted as part of the Criminal Appeal Reform Act of 1996 (Act), operated as a jurisdictional bar to appellate review of criminal appeals that did not present either preserved or fundamental error. The State conceded that the statute was not a limitation on the appellate courts' subject matter jurisdiction. The court agreed with this concession. After considering the language of the Act and the legislative history of Fla. Stat. ch. 924.051(3), the court construed the statute as merely codifying existing procedural bars to appellate review, which upheld the statute's constitutionality and was consistent with legislative intent in passing the Act. Nothing circumvented the requirement codified in the Act that in order to constitute reversible error, error must either be preserved for review or amount to fundamental error. The appellate courts, however, still retained the power to summarily address appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court accepted the state's concession of error. Failure to preserve an error was not a fundamental jurisdiction impediment that should result in dismissal, but was a nonjurisdictional bar to review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners filed applications for review of the decisions of various Florida District Courts of Appeal, to determine whether any unpreserved errors related to sentencing could be raised on direct appeal in light of the adoption of Fla. Stat. ch. 924.051, enacted as part of the Criminal Appeal Reform Act of 1996 (Act). The court had promulgated rules that would eliminate the problems of unpreserved sentencing errors raised on direct appeal because the time in which a defendant could file a motion to correct a sentencing error in the trial court was expanded to the time the first appellate brief is filed. However, the court still needed to resolve cases of those petitioners who fell into the effective date of the Act and the rules. The court held that neither the interests of justice nor judicial economy would be served by preventing the appellate courts from correcting as fundamental error those serious, patent sentencing errors that had been brought to the courts' attention through the issues raised on appeal, and the appellate courts should correct as fundamental error those serious, patent sentencing errors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court previously denied petitioner's request for a writ of mandamus for failure to comply with the requirements of the Prisoner Indigency Statute,&nbsp;Fla.

The court granted in part petitioner's motion for rehearing and withdrew its prior opinion. The court found the copy requirement of ch. 57.085(7) unconstitutional as a violation of separation of powers and as a usurpation of the court's exclusive rulemaking authority, because the copy requirement interfered with court procedures and conflicted with Fla. R. App. P. 9.430. However, the court refused to grant a writ of mandamus, finding that neither U.S. Const. amend. XIII nor Fla. Stat. ch. 946.002 (1997) mandated that inmates be compensated for work in prison.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Decedent was petitioner's mother. Following decedent's second hip surgery and the death of her husband, decedent's disposition changed dramatically. She was unable to walk, refused to eat, and was disoriented. Financial difficulties forced decedent to moved in with petitioner and her boyfriend. Two weeks later, decedent died, showing extensive signs of neglect. Petitioner, convicted of neglect of an elderly person, challenged the constitutionality of the statute. The court affirmed her conviction, finding the statute constitutional. The statute's intent element was not unconstitutional where the statute required either willful behavior or culpable negligence, which was more than simple negligence. Petitioner could not argue the statute was vague where the statute elements were clearly met. Mother suffered from extreme dehydration and petitioner assumed care where she testified she &quot;took upon herself&quot; the responsibility to care for her mother. Petitioner did not have standing to claim the statute violated her mother's privacy right.</SPAN></P>

Testimony indicated that defendant grossly mutilated the victim's body while she was conscious.

The court rejected defendant's contentions. Defendant's claim of ineffective assistance was not properly before the court on direct appeal. Reversal based on motion to suppress statement was not warranted, because the trial court's admission of a statement obtained in violation of Miranda was harmless. Medical testimony that victim was conscious during the strangulation and beating supported a heinous aggravator determination. Necessity was not the standard for admissibility of the photographs. Photographs in question were admissible as relevant to the manner of the victim's death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State applied for review of the decision of the Second District Court of Appeal (Florida), reversing defendant's sentence as a violent career offender and remanding for resentencing under valid sentencing statutes in effect at time of sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant pled guilty to a criminal offense, he was sentenced, orally, to a triple sentence under Florida's violent offender statute. In the written order imposing the same sentence, the court referred to the enhanced sentence as imposed under the habitual offender statute. While defendant's initial appeal was pending, the court invalidated the violent offender statute, but not the habitual offender statute, on constitutional grounds. An intermediate appellate court, relying on the court's action, reversed defendant's sentence and remanded for sentencing under laws valid at the time of sentencing. The State appealed the reversal because the holding was in conflict with another appellate court. The court held that because the oral designation of the sentence was what mattered, the appellate court was correct in reversing and remanding. However, the proper sentencing statute to use, in light of earlier case law, was the valid sentencing statute in effect at the time of defendant's offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court approved the appellate decision in part, as it correctly determined that defendant could not be sentenced under an unconstitutional statute, but reversed and remanded for sentencing under valid laws in effect at time of offenses, not sentencing.</SPAN></P>

The conviction was affirmed. At issue was whether the trial court committed fundamental error by instructing the jury in accordance with the standard instruction on entrapment that was in effect at the time of the offense and trial, but did not accurately reflect the burden of proof analysis on entrapment. Erroneous instruction as to a defense was not fundamental error. The court approved the holding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The District Court of Appeal, Second District (Florida), certified to the state's highest court defendant's appeal of trial court judgments imposing sentences for defendant's armed robbery convictions. Defendant challenged those sentences on the grounds that a 1995 enactment amending Florida's sentencing guidelines violated the single subject rule of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery. On appeal, he challenged the constitutionality of the statute under which he was sentenced, 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 184 (statute), as violative of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6 (single subject rule), requiring that every law embrace only one subject and that the subject be expressed in the title. Defendant had standing to assert the challenge, and his failure to do so in the trial court did not bar review because his increased sentences under the statute implicated a fundamental due process liberty interest. The statute violated the single subject rule because it embraced, in title and body, provisions concerning civil remedies for victims of domestic violence and criminal provisions that were not logically connected. Declining to sever the domestic violence provisions to save remaining the sections because such a decision was a legislative choice, the court ruled that the statute was entirely void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court modified Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.070(j) so that form was not elevated over substance when a party's compliance with a procedural or statutory predicate rendered the suit time-barred under a statute of limitations defense. The court held that when a motion for leave to amend was filed for the purpose of adding new parties, the one-year period for service of process in Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.420(e) began to run on the date that the motion was filed. The motion to amend was sufficient to stand in place of an amended complaint if it identified the new party, and set forth the relief requested. The action was, therefore, deemed commenced with the filing as to the new defendant pursuant to Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.050 within the applicable limitation period.</SPAN></P>

The court held that witnesses' affidavits that defendant was not guilty were inadmissible because they consisted of double hearsay and because they did not affect the testimony by the three eyewitnesses who identified defendant as the perpetrator. Defendant claimed that the amended law could not be retroactively applied because he was sentenced to be executed by electrocution, not lethal injection. The court disagreed because only the manner, not the penalty was effected. Defendant also argued that lethal injection constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court disagreed because the lethal injection is painless if administered correctly.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that there was confusion regarding the application of the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Procedural questions arose concerning the appointment of counsel for death-sentenced defendants whose appeals were pending prior to the effective date of the Act, as well as the procedures that apply to such defendants. Questions arose as to what procedures apply to defendants who had postconviction actions pending on the effective date. Procedural questions concerning the disclosure of public records were also raised.In response to the Legislature's invitation to adopt new rules, the court agreed to hear argument for proposed new rules and the arguments on issues raised on behalf of numerous death-sentenced defendants. The court held that interim procedures were appropriate in the interest of proper and orderly processing of postconviction proceedings in capital cases. The court readopted Rules 3.850, 3.851, and 3.852 as they existed prior to the effective date of the Act. The court held that the readopted rules governed all actions for capital postconviction relief until June 30, 2000, or such time as the court adopted new rules, whichever occurred first.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant personal injury protection insurance provider challenged an order by the District Court of Appeal - Fifth District - (Florida) holding unconstitutional the portion of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 627.736(5) (1997) requiring mandatory arbitration for all medical provider assignees and requiring a prevailing party standard to apply with regard to attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee medical provider submitted bills to appellant personal injury protection (PIP) provider, which refused to pay them. Appellant moved to dismiss appellee suit for payment, claiming that the dispute had to be referred to binding arbitration in accordance with Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 627.736(5) (1997). The Supreme Court held the mandatory arbitration unconstitutional by finding that the provision violated the right of medical providers to access to the courts. The court also found that the prevailing party attorney-fee provision of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 627.736(5) (1997) violated the due process rights of medical providers and was not a reasonable alternative to seeking redress in the courts. The limited review and the conclusiveness attached to the arbitration award without the right of a trial de novo diminished the right to have the ultimate decision in a case made by a court. There was no voluntary agreement to arbitrate between medical providers and PIP insurers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed because mandatory arbitration was not a reasonable alternative to appellee medical provider having the claims heard in court, and the legislature had not shown an overpowering public necessity for abolishing this right. The attorney-fee provision in Florida's motor vehicle no-fault law violated the medical providers' due process rights as well.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered an order which required defendant to pay interest retroactive to the date of the request for the order to show cause and monthly interest payments thereafter. Judgment reversed on appeal because the court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 702.10(2) (1997) was unconstitutional under both the U.S. Const. and the Florida Const.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee father had an out- of-wedlock child with mother in 1994. Appellee paid court-ordered child support and was actively involved in the child's life. The child lived with mother and appellants, the child's maternal grandparents.

The court affirmed, holding that, as with two other subsections of the statute previously held unconstitutional, subsection (d), which referred to grandparent visitation with children born out of wedlock, also violated a parent's right to privacy. The fact that the parents were never married did not change the analysis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Affirmed; the subsection of the grandparent visitation statute which referred to visitation with children born out of wedlock, violated appellee's right to familial privacy just as did the other subsections that had previously been held unconstitutional; the fact that the parents were not married did not change the analysis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, a prisoner under sentence of death, appealed the trial court's order denying his Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion for postconviction relief. He also petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus. Petitioner alleged his counsel at trial was ineffective, particularly contending that counsel's remarks at trial amounted to an admission of guilt and that he had not given his approval to plead guilty. The court held that counsel's complete concession of petitioner's guilt nullified the adversarial quality of the proceedings. Therefore, prejudice could be presumed, and the question became whether petitioner gave his consent to a strategy of admitting guilt. Because petitioner alleged specifically in his appeal that he did not do so, the court remanded to the circuit court to hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim. In light of the disposition of the appeal, the habeas petition was not addressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Matter remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the claim. Counsel's complete concession of petitioner's guilt nullified the adversarial quality of the proceedings, and because petitioner alleged he did not consent to what amounted to a guilty plea, a hearing was required to address that issue.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with the district court's decision that prevented the statute of repose from extinguishing a products liability cause of action when plaintiff's injuries were latent and undiscoverable within the repose period. The court found that if Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031(2) (1975) applied, respondent's claim would have been barred even though the injury did not become evident until much later. If the statute was applicable, there would have been a denial of access to the courts.</SPAN></P>

R. Civ. P. 1.630, the court improperly heard the merits of the petition and ruled on it forthwith without giving the county an opportunity to answer the petition; [3]-The court violated the county's due process right by expanding the scope of a hearing to address a matter not noticed for hearing--the merits of appellees' petition.</SPAN></P>

Stat., violated a defendant's right to a jury trial by allowing punishment beyond the statutory maximum based on judge-made factual findings, and thus had to be interpreted to mandate that upward departures in a sentence be based on a jury determination, absent either a waiver by the defendant or a negotiated sentence; therefore, after a guilty verdict was reached, the State had to present evidence to the jury showing why sentencing the defendant to a non-prison sanction would endanger the public; [2]-Though defendant's upward departure sentence was not based on a jury finding, the error was harmless because any rational jury would have found that she posed a financial danger to the public based on her prior petit theft and burglary convictions and the fact that she committed the instant theft offense soon after her release from jail.</SPAN></P>

Stat. (2014). HOLDINGS: [1]-The trial court erred in revoking defendant's probation because, although the trial court and the complainant were understandably concerned by defendant's electronic monitoring tracking record showing that he had been in the complainant's yard, the State of Florida failed to prove that defendant committed the offense of loitering and prowling. The purpose of the statute was not effectuated because a law enforcement officer determined two months after the alleged suspicious conduct that there was a cause for alarm or concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">HOLDINGS: [1]-With regard to defendant's conviction as a principal for the crime of grand theft of a motor vehicle under &sect; 812.014, Fla. Stat. (2014), the State failed to prove defendant: knew the gray truck was stolen, and committed an act to assist the co-defendant in the theft of the gray truck; [2]-In short, the State failed to present evidence that defendant knew that the gray truck was stolen or that he assisted the co-defendant in stealing the truck. As a matter of law, the evidence did not support a conviction for grand theft of a motor vehicle, even under the principal theory; [3]-The State's evidence was plainly insufficient and thus it was fundamental error for defendant to be convicted of grand theft of a motor vehicle; [4]-Because defendant's sentence fell within statutory limits, the court had to affirm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the conviction and sentence on the grand theft of a motor vehicle charge. It affirmed in all other respects. The court remanded the case to the trial court to vacate the conviction and its corresponding five-year prison sentence. It certified a question to the Supreme Court of Florida as being of great public importance.</SPAN></P>

Stat. (2010), for imposing the death penalty but not the actual death penalty itself, &sect; 775.082(2) (2015) was inapplicable, and the new capital sentencing statute did not create an ex post facto violation under U.S. Const. art.

Stat.) did not apply; [2]-Defendant's conviction of child abuse as to victim two was proper because the four-year statute of limitations would have expired on November 15, 2003 so the 2003 amendment to &sect; 775.17 applied to extend the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

Stat. (2012), because the father would have been incarcerated for nearly fifty percent of the child's minority when the father was released from prison, and, as such, the father would be incarcerated for a significant portion of the child's minority; the length of child's current foster placement, the child's young age, and the fact that the father could not take custody of the child for several years weighed in favor of termination; [2]-Termination of the father's parental rights was in the child's best interest, &sect; 39.810, Fla. Stat. (2012), because, inter alia, the father's incarceration prevented him from taking care of the child, the child had no bond with the father, and the father's incarceration would continue until 2017.</SPAN></P>

The jury could have reasonably found that the threat to defendant was over when he armed himself with the knife, that his use of deadly force was not necessary, and his testimony provided sufficient evidence to create a jury question as to whether he stabbed the victims in self-defense; [2]-Because defendant was not forced to make a choice between two constitutional rights, his testimony at the pre-trial Stand Your Ground immunity hearing under &sect; 76.032, Fla. Stat. (2008), was admissible against him at trial; [3]-Because the standard instruction on the justifiable use of deadly force was a correct statement of the law, defendant did not show error.</SPAN></P>
