Stat. Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 6086(a)(10), as the plan's mandatory framework did not authorize major development, including principal retail establishments, at the non-growth-center highway interchange.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff construction company brought an action against defendant Vermont Agency of Transportation for breach of contract and other claims.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company argued that it had no obligation to exhaust administrative remedies because the agency's claims process did not comport with the Administrative Procedure Act or due process. The court upheld the determination that the company had to exhaust its administrative remedies. Pursuant to the Transportation Board's enabling legislation,&nbsp;Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 5, review before the board was essentially de novo review. Furthermore, the board was empowered to require development of the record. Given these due process protections, there was no basis to allow the company to avoid that legislatively authorized administrative review and have its contract dispute reviewed initially in the superior court. Furthermore, because the claims process was not primarily adjudicative in nature and contractors could obtain procedural due process protections in an appeal to the board, the agency was not required to engage in formal rulemaking to establish procedures for its claim process. By the same token, the company could not prevail on its argument that agency decisionmakers in the claims process were not neutral adjudicators.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant husband sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court, Franklin Unit, Civil Division (Vermont), which held that the family division of the superior court had exclusive jurisdiction over the distribution of the marital property belonging to the husband and appellee wife, although their marriage ended in annulment, pursuant to Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 751.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the wife initially filed a complaint for divorce against the husband, it was determined that she was still married to her first husband at the time of the parties' marriage. The family division held that since the marriage was void at its inception pursuant to Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 511(a), it lacked jurisdiction to resolve the property dispute. Accordingly, the husband filed small claims cases in the civil division, one of which involved the parties' marital property. On appeal from a decision thereon, the civil division held that both it, and the small claims court, lacked jurisdiction. On further review, the Court held that pursuant to &sect; 751, the family division had the exclusive jurisdiction to divide marital property. Such authority extended to annulment actions as well, as the Legislature deemed the family division best suited to divide parties' property in all case filed under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, ch. 11. The unappealed order was not binding based on collateral estoppel, as an exception applied because the ruling was plainly beyond the subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 1103 against defendant ex-partner. The Superior Court, Caledonia Unit, Family Division (Vermont) issued the order. Defendant filed a petition for visitation and a parentage complaint.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was not the children's biological father but played a father-figure role in their lives. After plaintiff moved in with a new partner, defendant and a friend, having ascertained that plaintiff's partner was at work, went to plaintiff's home at 2 a.m. and banged repeatedly on the door. They did the same thing 24 hours later. The court rejected defendant's argument that equity provided a jurisdictional basis for de facto parents to petition the family court for custody, parentage and visitation in the absence of a statutory right to do so. The court declined to abandon its decision in Titchenal and to accept a broad de facto parent doctrine that essentially would allow any former domestic partner to compel a biological parent to defend against the unrelated ex-partner's claim that he or she was a &quot;parent&quot; entitled to judicially enforced parental rights and responsibilities. Next, the trial court did not err in issuing a final RFA order denying defendant contact with the children. The trial court found that defendant placed plaintiff and her children in imminent fear of serious physical harm through his back-to-back 2 a.m. forays to plaintiff's residence.</SPAN></P>

In its final judgment of divorce, the Superior Court, Chittenden Unit, Family Division (Vermont) included an offset for the disparity in value between the parties' projected Social Security retirement benefits. The husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court awarded the wife $88,158 to offset the value of the Social Security differential. The court held that the husband had not preserved his claim of federal preemption, as his argument based solely on the assertion that Social Security benefits were too speculative to be considered a marital asset did not fairly and reasonably apprise the trial court of the federal preemption claim. Next, based on Vermont's own law and precedents and the nature of the benefits at issue, the court agreed with other courts that Social Security retirement benefits were not marital property and should not be divided, offset, or considered in the trial court's distribution of the marital estate. Social Security benefits were subject to revision at congressional will, and therefore could not be more than an expectancy, the value of which could not be assessed without excessive speculation. Therefore, the trial court erred in awarding the wife a direct offset. As omitting those benefits only marginally affected the $1 million marital estate, the trial court was to recalculate the award pursuant to the original percentage division of 80 percent for the wife and 20 percent for the husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's decision. It remanded the case for the trial court to recalculate its award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer admitted his failure to pay taxes but denied ever having received notice of the tax sale. The trial court, basing its decision on the United States Supreme Court's Flowers decision, held that the town's failure to take additional steps prior to the tax sale, once the notice of tax sale sent by registered mail was returned unclaimed, rendered its notice to the taxpayer insufficient for due process purposes and that the town's post-sale, pre-redemption notice did not remedy the constitutional infirmity. The court agreed that Flowers applied here. The facts that the taxpayer lived at the property and might have seen the notices of attempted delivery did not meaningfully distinguish this case from Flowers. Furthermore, the multiple notices of delinquency the town sent via first-class mail did not notify the taxpayer that an actual sale had been scheduled. Next, once notice of a tax sale was returned unclaimed, a town had to take additional reasonable steps to apprise the taxpayer of the impending sale before it occurred, rather than after the sale but prior to the transfer of title at the end of the statutory redemption period as argued by the purchasers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a jury trial in the Superior Court, Windham Unit, Criminal Division (Vermont), defendant was convicted of violating a relief-from-abuse (RFA) order under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 1030(b). He appealed, arguing that the jury instruction given was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court instructed the jury that it could convict defendant for violating an abuse-prevention order prohibiting him from harassing the complainant if it concluded that he engaged in conduct that would cause a reasonable person to be &quot;annoyed, irritated, tormented or alarmed.&quot; Defendant sent the complainant about 37 text messages in 37 days. None of the messages was threatening or contained language that was profane, threatening, intimidating, or violent. The court held that in the absence of any elaboration in an RFA order regarding the intended definition of &quot;harassment&quot; or the type of conduct prohibited, the most appropriate touchstone for defining the term in the context of a prosecution for violation of the order was the definition in the stalking statute,&nbsp;Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 1061(4), which required an element of threat. Under this definition, the instruction that allowed the jury to convict defendant on the basis of objectively annoying conduct was error. Defendant was significantly prejudiced by the instruction, as the State's case, and the conviction, rested squarely on the overly broad definition of harassment used in the trial court's jury instructions.</SPAN></P>

There was no barrier to a land use panel relying upon the maximum or most onerous impacts a project might have when attempting to determine if that project would bring undue adverse impacts to a neighborhood. The DRB did not misconstrue the character of the affected area. The cumulative impact of added noise and other adverse effects from a project in a mixed residential/commercial area had to be carefully considered. The zoning regulation's definition of &quot;neighborhood&quot; was not so vague as to violate due process. The plain import of the rule was to include areas within sight or sound of the proposed project, which provided a sufficiently clear and specific location from which to measure its impacts. Finally, it was not unreasonable for the town to establish noise limit standards that took into account surrounding uses and the expectations created by those uses. The ordinance was not so vague that it was essentially without an ascertainable standard.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also denied his post-judgment motion to vacate a writ of attachment. The matter arose from the decedent's criminal conduct towards the victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent allegedly committed numerous crimes against the victim at her home, but he killed himself shortly before his arraignment. Thereafter, the victim filed claims of assault and battery, false imprisonment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress against the decedent's estate. After bifurcating the issues of liability and PD, the jury returned a verdict in the victim's favor. After additional evidence, including the decedent's criminal history, the victim was awarded PD. On appeal, the court found that evidence of the decedent's prior convictions was properly admitted under Vt. R. Evid. 401 because it was relevant to the jury's assessment of the reprehensibility of the decedent's conduct. Further, it did not violate Vt. R. Evid. 404(b) because it was used for a permissible purpose. The PD award was not excessive in the circumstances, such that remittitur was not warranted. Rather, the PD was within the bounds of the evidence presented, including the decedent's intent and malice, it was a constitutionally acceptable amount, and it was not a punishment for the decedent's prior misconduct. The EA waived his right to challenge the attachment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff State of Vermont filed an action against defendant organization in which the State requested a declaration that defendant was a political action committee (PAC) under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 2801 and that it was in violation of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect;&sect; 2811, 2831, and 2892. The Superior Court, Washington Unit, Civil Division (Vermont) entered summary judgment in favor of the State. It imposed a civil penalty. The parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court first held that the &quot;magic words&quot; identified by the United States Supreme Court in Buckley did not have to be required in a communication from a PAC in order to uphold a registration, disclosure or identification requirement of the type here against either a vagueness challenge under the Fourteenth Amendment or an overbreadth challenge under the First Amendment. The statutes as applied to defendant were constitutional. As for whether &sect; 2801(4) was facially vague, the trial court's narrowing construction went too far. The court construed &quot;for the purpose of. influencing an election&quot; to mean &quot;for the objective purpose of persuading someone to vote in a certain manner in an election.&quot; So construed, &sect; 2801(4) was not vague. Defendant had violated &sect;&sect; 2811 and 2831. Its advertisements, which attacked a gubernatorial candidate's character and fitness for office, fit clearly into the PAC definition of supporting or opposing a candidate. Finally, remand was required for the trial court to consider the imposition of a fine for violation of the identification requirement, as its brief and unclear reference to the violation did not show a true exercise of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision, but remanded the case to the trial court for consideration of a penalty for the violation of the identification requirement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, an independent candidate for President of the United States and his supporters, brought a suit for injunctive relief against defendant Vermont Secretary of State in which they challenged the Secretary of State's interpretation of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 17,  2402. The Superior Court, Washington Unit, Civil Division (Vermont) granted permanent injunctive relief. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Secretary of State interpreted  2402(a)(4) to require that town clerks certify only names appearing on original nominating petitions, rather than on faxes or photocopies. The court agreed with the trial court that the requirement unduly burdened plaintiffs' First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. While the burden associated with this requirement was not severe, it was not trivial. Although a well-organized campaign could minimize the burden by collecting signatures from residents of different towns on different pages, or by starting the signature-gathering process earlier, segregating pages by town would require canvassers to be armed with dozens of different pages, and there were limits to how early a small, independent campaign could reasonably be expected to start gathering signatures. Furthermore, the requirement did not serve the State's interests of deterring fraud and promoting orderly elections. The fraud scenario offered by the State was contrived, and although the administrative burdens of allowing town clerks to certify names appearing on photocopies were real, they were not so substantial or insurmountable as to outweigh the burden on plaintiffs' rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After petitioner and others brought a successful Ex Post Facto Clause challenge to the use of the delayed-release statute,&nbsp;Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 28, &sect; 204b, to recalculate their minimum sentences, the Department of Corrections restored petitioner's original minimum sentence date. In the present case, petitioner argued that if it had not been for the DOC's unconstitutional application of &sect; 204b, he would have completed a rehabilitative program in time to have a reasonable probability of obtaining release on parole. The court stated that petitioner's inability to complete the program by the expiration of his minimum sentence was not, in and of itself, an Ex Post Facto Clause violation. It was at most a collateral consequence of a constellation of factors. Next, the temporary application of &sect; 204b did not render petitioner's plea agreement involuntary. There was no express promise of parole in the plea agreement. Moreover, petitioner's own pleadings directly contradicted the notion that he reasonably relied on any material misunderstanding that prejudiced him when agreeing to the plea, and he was in fact serving a sentence that fell within the range for which he bargained.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On remand from the present court, the Superior Court, Environmental Division (Vermont) held that appellant homeowner had changed the use of his home from a single-family residence to a rooming and boarding house. It granted summary judgment in favor of appellee town and levied a penalty of $63,142 against the homeowner, who appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Among other requirements, for a property to be a rooming-and-boarding house under the bylaws, the provisions for meals or sleeping accommodations had to be for a fixed period of time. The court rejected the homeowner's argument that his oral agreements with the residents created an at-will tenancy under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 27, &sect; 302. The individuals made continuous monthly payments, creating a periodic tenancy. The fact that the homeowner did not always require his tenants to pay the full amount of agreed-upon rent and allowed certain tenants to forgo some rent payments and provide maintenance or repair services in lieu of rent did not change the result. Next, when read together, the definitions of &quot;rooming and boarding house&quot; and &quot;family&quot; provided sufficient guidance to avoid standardless discretion on the part of the zoning administrator and provided a property owner with a general understanding of how to comply with the bylaws. Thus, the definitions were not unconstitutionally vague. Finally, the penalty was proper. It was well below the amount allowed by Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 4451, and the homeowner had ample opportunity to cure the violation following notice from the town.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the record supported UVM's determination.

He applied to the medical school while still enrolled as a undergraduate, and enrolled as a medical student within one year after completing his undergraduate coursework. In addition, there was sufficient evidence that plaintiff was supported by his family. He had acknowledged the receipt of financial support in a previous application for in-state status; his educational trust fund had increased during the previous year from $3,000 to $50,000 with no indication as to the source of the funds; his father was listed as the co-purchaser and co-borrower when plaintiff bought his residence; and his annual income was insufficient to fund the home purchase, trust fund, and education costs.

Stat. Ann. tit. 33, &sect; 5102(3)(D). The Superior Court, Bennington Unit, Family Division (Vermont) adjudicated the minor a CHINS. The minor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court stated that under &sect; 5102(3)(D), &quot;without justification&quot; was an element of a CHINS determination based on truancy which the State had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence. The State could meet this burden through properly admitted school records showing the child's unexcused absence. The court held that the evidence was plainly insufficient under this standard. The State called no witnesses from the minor's school to testify as to its policies and procedures governing whether, when, and how it reported a student truant, and adduced no school records to show that the minor was actually absent without justification on the days in question. An officer's description of the Sheriff's Department's general protocol might well have been sufficient to prove that he went to the minor's residence on each of the five days in question pursuant to a truancy report from the sheriff's department dispatcher, although he did not specifically so testify. There was no evidence from the school, however, as to its routine practice, and thus no basis to infer anything about what the school might have told the dispatcher on the days in question.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a voter and an independent candidate, brought suit against defendants, the State of Vermont and the Secretary of State, in which plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of Vermont's schedule for filing candidate petitions. The Superior Court, Washington Unit, Civil Division (Vermont) held that the deadline was constitutional under U.S. Const. amend. I. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 2356, independents had to register on the same day as primary candidates. This advanced their former registration date by approximately 70 days. The court held that the statute did not violate the First Amendment. The Vermont filing deadline applied equally to all candidates and did not place independents at a particular disadvantage for accessing the ballot. Rather, the registration deadline was a reasonable, nondiscriminatory regulation that imposed at most a minor burden on plaintiffs' rights. Furthermore, the state had a legitimate interest in that requiring independents to file their petition on the same day as major party candidates prevented &quot;sore-loser&quot; candidates. Next, plaintiffs argued that the trial court erred by relying on legislators' testimony regarding the purpose for the change in deadline. The court stated that plaintiffs failed to address how they were prejudiced by such testimony. Thus, even if the evidence were improperly admitted as historical evidence, the error, if any, was harmless under Vt. R. Civ. P. 61. Finally, plaintiffs had not adequately briefed their state constitutional claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As part of an identity theft investigation, police seized a personal computer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court first held that it had jurisdiction over the action. The State was challenging the judicial officer's authority to impose the conditions, which was a purely legal question. The court held that under U.S. Const. amend. IV, ex ante instructions were sometimes acceptable mechanisms for ensuring the particularity of a search. Next, the first condition, which prevented the State from relying upon the plain view doctrine, was both unnecessary and inappropriate. It was beyond the authority of a judicial officer issuing a warrant to abrogate a legal doctrine in this way. Next, conditions requiring that the search be performed by third parties or trained computer personnel operating behind a firewall were proper. Resorting to a neutral third-party screener might be the only way to provide meaningful privacy protections. The judicial officer properly limited the search techniques that police could employ and prohibited the use of sophisticated searching software without prior court authorization. Narrowing the search could still accomplish recovery of the incriminating evidence. The remaining conditions essentially echoed the requirements of Vt. R. Crim. P. 41.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Superior Court, Windsor Unit, Criminal Division (Vermont) imposed bail and conditions of release on defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A mental health professional screened defendant on the issue of his competency and concluded that he was not in need of treatment. The court held that there was no justiciable controversy. While the trial court was perplexed by the screener's determination and consequently perceived that its options were limited, it did not rule on whether an examination of defendant was warranted, whether an inpatient examination was the least restrictive environment necessary, or whether &sect; 4815(g)(1)&nbsp;unconstitutionally prohibited such an examination. Instead, it bypassed the issue entirely by setting bail and conditions of release. Given the lack of a decision on the questions raised, there was no injury to be addressed and no ripe controversy. The exception to the mootness doctrine for issues that were capable of repetition yet evaded review did not apply here because the issue was not once live and now moot; rather, by not ordering the evaluation, the trial court avoided the controversy altogether. Without a conclusive determination on the issue, there was no controversy to appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, an employee of the State of Vermont Agency of Transportation (AOT), filed an action against defendant State of Vermont. A jury in the Superior Court, Washington Unit, Civil Division (Vermont) awarded plaintiff damages on the ground that the State had retaliated against him for filing a workers' compensation claim in violation of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 710(b). The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 2002, plaintiff filed a claim for workers' compensation. In 2003, he was put on paid administrative leave after a female employee claimed that he had created a hostile work environment. In September 2003, plaintiff and the AOT negotiated an agreement resolving the allegations against him. The agreement contained a release clause. The court stated that remand was required for the trial court to address the agreement. The State had consistently and repeatedly argued that plaintiff waived any claims against the State, and this question was for the trial court to evaluate in the first instance. The failure of the trial court to resolve the State's motion under Vt. R. Civ. P. 50 was fatal to the jury verdict because for the most part, the retaliation claim was grounded on actions taken by the State pursuant to the agreement. A one-day public video surveillance of plaintiff done in 2004, after he filed a second workers' compensation claim, could not alone support the verdict. Such surveillance could be expected in response to a tip claiming fraud, regardless of the tip's source, and the court could not see how it would cause a reasonable person to forego a legitimate claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the judgment. It remanded the case for the trial court to address the issue of the 2003 agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was accused of giving his daughter and her friend fruit drinks that were drugged with prescription medication. He claimed that he had intended to drug his wife, but that the girls were drugged by mistake. The court first held that defendant had made a detailed objection to the trial court's instructions on transferred intent and thus had preserved his objection sufficiently under Vt. R. Crim. P. 30. Next, aggravated assault was a specific intent crime. Here, the trial court eliminated the State's burden of proving that defendant specifically intended to drug the two named girls when it instructed the jury that &quot;the State is not required to prove, but may prove, that the defendant intended that a specific person be harmed in this manner.&quot; Defendant admitted at trial that he deliberately gave &quot;stupefying drugs&quot; to his wife. With the trial court's instruction, it was therefore virtually assured that the jury would find him guilty of aggravated assault even if it did not believe that he actually intended to drug the girls. This was constitutional error and prejudiced defendant's ability to defend against the specific charges so substantially that a new trial was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The documents related to the investigation and discipline of city employees for viewing pornography at work. The court stated that in regard to the applicability of Vt. Stat.

Because this critical finding was absent as to the first eight items sought, remand was required. As for disciplinary letters involving two employees, the trial court applied the personal records exemption, &sect; 317(c)(7), and concluded that the public interest in disclosure outweighed any privacy interest. The union failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the balance of interests favored disclosure of the documents, from which the employees' names and suspension dates had been redacted. Finally, the trial court erred in allowing the newspaper to review in camera numerous nonpublic records that depicted possible child pornography, notwithstanding its conclusion that public release of these images was not proper.

The trial court held that the records were exempt as &quot;records dealing with the detection and investigation of crime.&quot; The court held that there was no support for the imposition of either a time-based limitation or a balancing test in the plain language of &sect; 317(c)(5). The language instead reflected the legislature's intent to permanently and categorically exempt all criminal investigatory records from public disclosure. Furthermore, because &sect; 317(c)(5) provided a record-based, rather than content-based, limitation, the court rejected plaintiff's argument that the trial court could release investigatory records but require redaction of information. Moreover, the statute drew no distinction between those records that dealt with a criminal investigation of a police officer and those involving a criminal investigation of other citizens. Thus, the records were entitled to a blanket exemption under &sect; 317(c)(5). Finally, Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 6 was not self-executing and thus did not mandate disclosure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The order of the Windsor Superior Court, Criminal Division, dated September 22, 2010, is affirmed in all respects, except that the matter is remanded for the court to impose restrictions, consistent with this opinion, on the victim's disclosure of any results from the testing of defendant for sexually transmitted diseases.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant was convicted of a sex offense, the Superior Court, Windsor Unit, Criminal Division (Vermont) granted the State's motion to compel him to submit to testing for sexually transmitted diseases under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 3256. Defendant appealed, arguing that the statute violated Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court stated that with regard to administrative searches, it would abandon the probable-cause and warrant requirements only under exceptional circumstances when the State demonstrated that special needs beyond normal law enforcement made those requirements impracticable and those special needs outweighed countervailing privacy interests. Statutes such as these were directed at public health matters, not law enforcement. Moreover, the courts had also recognized that imposing probable-cause and warrant requirements would be entirely impracticable in this context because many sexually transmitted diseases, particularly the AIDS virus, had no outward manifestations that would permit a probable-cause determination for obtaining a warrant. Testing offenders could provide to victims some psychological benefit that outweighed the offenders' significantly diminished interest in preventing the testing of bodily fluids forced upon their unwilling victims. Thus, as long as the trial court imposed restrictions that comported with the statute's obvious intent to prevent public dissemination of the perpetrator's test results, there was no constitutional infirmity to the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order compelling testing, but remanded the matter for the trial court to order the victim not to disclose defendant's test results to anyone except for the victim's medical provider or counselor, who, in turn, would have an obligation to keep confidential information revealed by their patients.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff town resident brought an action against defendant town in which he alleged that defendant had violated Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 7, the Common Benefits Clause. The Superior Court, Franklin Unit, Civil Division (Vermont) held that art. 7 was self-executing and awarded plaintiff monetary damages for the violation. Defendant appealed, and plaintiff cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court first held that although art. 7 did not provide a private remedy for discriminatory treatment, it was self-executing. It would make little sense for art. 7 to require legislative action in order to prohibit biased and exclusionary government actions. Furthermore, monetary damages were an appropriate remedy here. The essence of the constitutional violation was the selectboard's repeated failure to provide fair and impartial decisionmaking, the result of a relentless bias against plaintiff and favoritism toward his neighbors. Remand was required to recalculate the damages, however. The actual harm was not the speculative loss in development value, but plaintiff's anguish and inconvenience resulting from years of efforts to gain reasonable access to his property, together with any additional costs for road improvements caused by the delay. The court held that plaintiff was not entitled to punitive damages. Because the twin aims of punishment and deterrence were not served when punitive damages were levied against a population for the acts of its elected officials, municipal corporations could not be held liable for punitive damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of liability against defendant and reversed the damage award. It remanded the case for further proceedings on the issue of damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant called the victim twice and screamed profanity-laden insults at her. The victim was the mother of defendant's live-in boyfriend and had spoken to defendant many times. She testified that she was absolutely sure that defendant was the caller, although the caller's phone number registered on her caller ID as &quot;withheld.&quot; Defendant argued that her calls were not anonymous, as required by &sect; 1027, because the victim knew that defendant was the caller. The court stated that a telephone caller's anonymity depended in part on the listener's nonrecognition of the person engaging in the call, since at the instant of recognition the caller's name or identity, or both, were known. Under any definition, a call could not be anonymous when its author was known to the listener. It was therefore a necessary condition of &sect; 1027 anonymity that the person taking the call did not know the sender. As the victim here knew that defendant was the caller, defendant's calls were not anonymous within the meaning of &sect; 1027.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a trial in the Superior Court, Windsor Unit, Criminal Division (Vermont), defendant was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court rejected defendant's argument that he had not voluntarily consented to the PBT. Defendant did not challenge the trial court's finding that the odor of alcohol, an empty beer container, and defendant's watery eyes and admission to drinking provided an adequate basis for the trooper to proceed with the PBT. Because the constitutional standard under U.S. Const. amend. IV had already been met by reasonable suspicion, there was no additional requirement to obtain voluntary consent. Under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 1203(f), however, when an officer had a reasonable suspicion of DUI, he could request that the suspect provide a breath sample, but not order such participation. Here, the officer did not request that defendant take the PBT, but simply put it up to him. Thus, the result of the PBT should not have been considered. The error was harmless, however. The officer's observations provided reasonable suspicion to conduct field sobriety tests, which strongly indicated that defendant was impaired. This combined with the officer's other observations provided probable cause to arrest defendant. Thus, suppression was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the trial court properly found that a zoning administrator (ZA) was the DRB's record custodian under Vt.

The ZA's affidavit showed that he acted as the DRB's clerk, collected all DRB communications, responded to requests for public records, and had custody of all paperwork related to the subdivision application which concerned plaintiff. There was no merit to plaintiff's argument that DRB members were required to answer his requests personally. Plaintiff conceded that he had received all the records he sought. Next, the Environmental Division did not violate plaintiff's right to free speech under U.S. Const. amend. I and Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 13. It directed only that plaintiff conform to the discovery rules. Next, even if the town manager violated Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 13 by interrupting plaintiff's speech to a selectboard, plaintiff's access to successive meetings and his free ability to express his thoughts in this case cured any alleged free speech violations.

The court stated that it was reasonable for the trial court to construe the phrase &quot;retail sales/rentals&quot; to mean &quot;retail sales or retail rentals.&quot; In construing &quot;retail rentals,&quot; however, the trial court ignored the ordinance's language defining &quot;retail&quot; establishments as shops or stores providing goods and services. Furthermore, the trial court failed to take into account the subsections surrounding the ordinance's &quot;retail sales/rentals&quot; provision. These subsections listed other permitted uses, such as &quot;personal service establishments&quot; and &quot;contractors.&quot; Such businesses involved direct, face-to-face transactions with customers. Using the common understanding of the words involved, and in the context of the overall scheme and purpose of the district, it was clear that the bylaws' drafters intended &quot;retail sales/rentals&quot; to include only residential and small-scale commercial establishments trading in services or in goods, for sale and for rent, as opposed to renting storage space.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court rejected defendant's constitutional arguments. Defendant was cited for a civil traffic violation, not a criminal offense; therefore, the principal cases he relied on to support his constitutional arguments were inapposite. If defendant were correct that providing the option of paying a waiver amount violated the constitutional rights of those cited for traffic violations, all persons cited would be required to participate in administrative proceedings regarding minor traffic violations. The hearing officer did not err in admitting results from the use of the laser device used to measure defendant's speed without first holding an evidentiary hearing on the device's reliability. Defendant had not identified any evidence suggesting that the device incorporated a novel technology or was significantly different from or less accurate than other speed-detection devices. Finally, the requirement that defendant pay filing fees and the cost of a hearing transcript did not violate Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 4.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury in the District Court of Vermont, Unit No. 2, Bennington Circuit, convicted defendant of leaving the scene of an accident with property damage resulting under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 1128(a), aggravated assault under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 1024(a)(4), and other offenses. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court first held that the trial court did not err under Vt. R. Evid. 403 in admitting evidence of defendant's racist beliefs. The evidence of defendant's presence at a bar where he used a racial epithet focused on his high level of intoxication and his aggressive interaction with another patron. Simple assault under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 1023(a) was not a lesser included element of aggravated assault as charged. Although an instruction that created a mandatory inference violated due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, it was not ultimately prejudicial because the question of why defendant lashed out at police officers was never at issue. Even if the omission of a diminished capacity instruction was error, it was not prejudicial, as defendant never raised intoxication as a defense. The trial court properly denied a necessity instruction on the leaving-the-scene-of-an-accident charge. Defendant created any &quot;emergency&quot; that existed, and he had ample opportunity to inform police of the accident. Finally, an officer's testimony that he suffered some discomfort from being kicked was sufficient to show that he suffered the injury required for the aggravated assault conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the circumstantial evidence was sufficient grounds for denying a judgment of acquittal. There was uncontested evidence that when defendant abandoned the project, he had left the interior work largely incomplete, the roof not entirely tied into the existing house, and the siding on the ground. Just a few weeks before leaving the project incomplete, defendant cashed checks from the homeowners totaling $15,000 and ceased communicating with the homeowners. The trial court violated Vt. R. Evid. 303(b), however, in giving a permissive inference instruction. Rule 303 required proof of the basic fact beyond a reasonable doubt before a trial court could submit a specific instruction on the permissive inference to the jury. Here, the trial court had no basis to believe the State had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the homeowners had requested performance of the contract, a basic fact necessary for instructing on the statutory inference in &sect; 2029. Furthermore, the instruction given was flawed: it eliminated the statutory elements that defendant knowingly promised performance he knew would not be performed and that the homeowners requested performance or a refund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's probation was revoked on the ground that he had threatened his landlord. The court held that the terms of the probation condition did not fairly inform defendant of what actions might subject him to probation revocation and therefore violated due process. While violent behavior might be more self-evident, what constituted threatening behavior was less clear. Here, defendant did no more than argue with his landlord. He was mouthy and obnoxious, but did nothing beyond expressing his displeasure at a perceived injustice. The idea that such behavior could properly be considered either &quot;violent or threatening&quot; or that the language of the condition could fairly apprise him that he had to curb his tongue in any heated exchange or risk further incarceration was to stretch its meaning impermissibly. As written, the condition did not afford defendant a reasonable opportunity to know what actions were prohibited, so that he might act accordingly. Furthermore, contrary to the State's argument, defendant's acts could not have given rise to a charge of disorderly conduct under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 1026.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A father filed a motion to terminate the voluntary guardianship of a child by her grandfather. The grandfather filed a petition to terminate parental rights under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 15A, &sect; 3-504.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the trial court properly denied the grandfather's petition to terminate the father's parental rights. The father's failure to make support payments to the grandfather was not, alone, a failure to exercise parental responsibility within the meaning of the statute. The trial court found that the grandfather would not have accepted payments had the father attempted to make them. As for the other statutory factors, the trial court's findings supported the view that the father would have regularly communicated or visited with the child had he been given the opportunity to do so. The trial court's conclusion that the father manifested an ability and willingness to assume custody was clearly supported by its findings. The trial court's findings supported the conclusion that the father would be able to resume parental duties within a reasonable period of time. The trial court erred in denying the father's motion to terminate the guardianship. Its primary reasoning for denying the motion--that the child was well-adjusted to her current home and that had been well cared for during the guardianship--was insufficient to overcome the father's parental presumption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While serving as an assistant judge, respondent ran successfully for probate judge.

It plainly provided that a judge was to resign from judicial office upon becoming a candidate for &quot;any elective office,&quot; not any non-judicial elective office. Next, the canon did not violate the federal Equal Protection Clause. It reflected the national recognition of the need to protect the fairness, and perceived fairness, of judicial decision-making and minimize the distraction of election campaigns. In view of those interests, the canon also did not violate U.S. Const. amend. I. The canon was not in conflict with Vt. Const. ch. II, &sect; 54 or Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 8. It did not violate the Common Benefit Clause of Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 7. It was reasonably and justly related to the legitimate interests that underlay it. Finally, a public reprimand was an appropriate sanction.

The validation studies were well within the scope of what defense counsel could be expected to investigate, and Brady imposed no additional duty on the prosecution team members to ferret out any potentially defense-favorable information from materials that were so disclosed. Next, the fact that defendant's conduct was punishable either as aggravated murder under &sect; 2311(a)(8) or as first-degree murder under Vt. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In connection with a legal malpractice suit brought by plaintiff client against defendant attorney for legal malpractice, the Rutland Superior Court (Vermont) directed plaintiff, who acted pro se, to show cause why he should not be sanctioned under Vt. R. Civ. P. 11. It subsequently directed the clerk to refuse to accept for filing any future document from plaintiff unless it was signed by an attorney. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the sanction was justified. The trial court identified five filings that plainly violated Rule 11 as being repetitive and unsupported by fact or law. In response to the show cause order, plaintiff relied on no law or rule to justify his submissions, but instead offered more of the same allegations of conspiracy between defendant and virtually every member of the judiciary coming into contact with this or other cases involving him. The limits did not diminish but furthered the right of access to the courts under Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 4 by permitting courts to devote their finite resources to the consideration of legitimate claims of persons who had not abused the process. Plaintiff's pro se status was no passport to waste the trial court's time indefinitely. Applying the order to any document, however, was overbroad, as there was no findings of similar abuses by plaintiff in other litigation. Thus, the sanction was revised to apply only to the present case and any derivatives from it raising the same claims. The sanction also required revision to permit plaintiff to prove that he was without the means to retain an attorney as necessary to comply with the order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's decision, as modified to explicitly limit its application to the present case and to allow plaintiff the opportunity to move for reconsideration due to inability to afford counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury in the District Court of Vermont, Unit No. 1, Windham Circuit convicted defendant of felony possession of cocaine, misdemeanor possession of marijuana, and misdemeanor providing false information to an officer. He appealed from his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the seizure of the physical evidence obtained was justified on grounds other than the statements defendant made without having received Miranda warnings. The distinctive characteristics of the dollar bill pouch dropped by defendant, combined with the officer's testimony that such a container was commonly used to carry drugs, provided the officer with probable cause to seize the pouch. The seizure met the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement. The dollar bill was folded in such a distinctive way that it justified the officer's subsequent inspection of its contents. Thus, the seizure was justified under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 11. Next, it was not improper for the sentencing judge to reference her experience as a prosecutor in drug-related criminal proceedings as an aid to her analysis of the unchallenged facts before her. Finally, a sentence for cocaine possession that imposed a minimum term of 4 years and 11 months and a maximum term of 5 years violated Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 7031(a) by imposing a fixed term. The difference between the minimum and maximum terms was so minimal as to be effectively nonexistent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction. It reversed the sentence for cocaine possession and remanded for resentencing on this charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, former state troopers who were forced to retire at age 55 under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 3, &sect; 459(a)(2), filed an action against defendants, the Vermont Department of Public Safety and the Commissioner of Public Safety. The Windham Superior Court (Vermont) held that the mandatory retirement age did not violate the Common Benefits Clause, Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 7, and entered judgment for defendants. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs argued that both &sect; 459(a)(2) and Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 495f, the statutory exception to the Vermont Fair Employment Practices Act for law enforcement officers, violated the Common Benefits Clause. The court held that &sect; 459(a)(2) bore a reasonable and just relationship to legitimate state interests. The statute advanced the State's goal of having a police force that was mentally and physically capable of performing its tasks. It was not so overinclusive that it violated the Common Benefits Clause as a matter of law if there was no alternative to mandatory retirement to meet the State's legitimate objectives. Furthermore, the exact issues being debated in this litigation remained under active investigation and consideration in the political process. The legislature could experiment with different approaches to protecting public safety without irrevocably choosing one until the right approach was clear. Thus, the court, following the United States Supreme Court's approach in Clover Leaf Creamery, would not intrude into the ongoing political process. Accordingly, neither &sect; 459(a)(2) nor &sect; 495f violated the Common Benefits Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant began intimidating plaintiffs and vandalizing their property after a dispute over a tree. The court held that the trial court erred in granting the injunction. In granting relief, the trial court relied on three sources of evidence: testimony from the 2009 injunction hearing, the present court's opinion in a previous appeal, and the jury verdict in 2006. The trial court's reliance on the language in the appellate opinion to support the findings of a hate-motivated crime was misplaced, as the issue of a hate-motivated crime was neither appealed nor decided by the court. As for the 2006 jury trial, the fact that the same judge sat at both the jury trial and the injunction hearing could not convert an award of money damages in a tort case into a finding of hate-motivated crime for purposes of granting injunctive relief. There was never an express jury finding that defendant's malice was specifically motivated by plaintiffs' ethnicity or perceived religion. As for the evidence introduced in 2009, plaintiffs had not shown the required nexus between the harmful acts and the prohibited discriminatory animus. This required a remand for additional evidence or further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The Vermont Commissioner of Labor granted summary judgment to defendant on the ground that plaintiff was intoxicated at the time of his injury and thus was ineligible under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 649 for compensation. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A co-worker offered plaintiff a full soda bottle that was in defendant's refrigerator. Plaintiff took the bottle home. Several days later, he drank from the bottle, which contained the caustic. While he was being treated in the emergency room, his blood alcohol content was measured at 0.15 to 0.16, although witnesses stated that he did not appear intoxicated. The court first held that the Commissioner erred in not resolving the initial inquiry as to whether plaintiff's injury arose out of and in the course of employment under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 618. It held that the accident arose out of plaintiff's employment. But for his employment, the instrument of plaintiff's injury would never have arrived in his hands. The case required remand to determine whether the injury was within the course of employment, as this was a fact-intensive analysis that the court could not undertake upon the record before it. Next, the Commissioner erred in finding that &sect; 649 barred plaintiff's claim. Plaintiff's injury arose out of his employment when he accepted the bottle. That act put the mechanism of injury in motion, and no one suggested that he was intoxicated at the time of acceptance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondents represented a client in a serious criminal matter. When a potential witness contacted them during trial and claimed to have information showing their client's innocence, they interviewed him by telephone and recorded the call. When the witness asked respondents whether they were recording the interview, one said &quot;no,&quot; and the other attempted to distract the witness. The court stated that respondents knowingly made a false statement about a material fact, the recording of the call, and thus violated Rule 4.1. Next, the court held that Rule 8.4(c) applied only to conduct that called into question an attorney's fitness to practice law. This narrow interpretation ensured that Rule 4.1 was not reduced to mere surplusage. Here, respondents' actions did not reflect adversely on their fitness to practice. They acted out of a determination to defend their client against serious criminal charges. The court held that a private reprimand was an appropriate sanction. Respondents were acting in the best interests of their client, not for personal gain; they cooperated with disciplinary counsel; and there was no injury to the client and no suggestion of a likelihood of repetition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court first rejected defendant's argument that the complainant's testimony at trial regarding her fear of defendant was not credible because it contradicted her statements to the police and her testimony at the motion-to-dismiss hearing. The credibility of the complainant and the weight of the evidence were matters that were entirely within the province of the jury. Next, the State satisfied Vt. R. Crim. P. 26 through its notice that it intended to introduce at trial the fact that the complainant was aware of defendant's prior conviction for simple assault. Defendant obviously understood the State's notice, as he filed a motion in limine to exclude the evidence. The complainant's testimony about defendant's prior assault on his ex-girlfriend was not inadmissible under Vt. R. Evid. 404(b). It was relevant to whether a reasonable person in the complainant's circumstances would fear bodily injury. It was not so inherently objectionable as to cause the jury to be hostile to defendant and thus to be inadmissible under Vt. R. Evid. 403.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court first held that &sect; 814(c) did not violate due process on its face by permitting a summary suspension in exigent circumstances. The United States Supreme Court had recognized that the necessity of quick action by the State, when coupled with the availability of some meaningful means by which to assess the propriety of the State's action at some time after the initial taking, could satisfy procedural due process. As for appellant's argument that he was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to contest the basis for the summary suspension, appellant was allowed to submit testimony challenging the State's evidence, to cross-examine the State's investigator, and to testify in his own behalf. This was sufficient to satisfy due process pending a more comprehensive final hearing. While a supplemental affidavit by a state investigator provided additional detail, it did not alter the basic charges against appellant or present an unfair surprise. A preponderance of the evidence standard comported with due process in license suspension proceedings. Finally, the Board could reasonably conclude that a temporary suspension was necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, who was sexually assaulted by a priest, filed an action against defendant diocese in which he alleged that defendant negligently hired, trained, supervised, and retained the priest. The Chittenden Superior Court (Vermont) held that the jury's finding that plaintiff sued over six years after he knew of the molestation lacked evidentiary support. It ruled that the jury verdict on liability and damages would stand. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that defendant was not entitled to summary judgment based on the statute of limitations of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 522(a). There was a genuine issue of material fact as to when plaintiff first linked his long-term mental health issues to the priest's conduct. The trial court erred, however, in deciding as a matter of law that plaintiff was not on inquiry notice. The priest's position in the diocese, and the evidence that plaintiff knew he had abused others, were sufficient for the jury to find that plaintiff was on inquiry notice. Next, the trial court erred in not excusing for cause a juror who was a member of the diocese. By media coverage and the bishop's statements in church and in a church publication, the juror was very likely aware of the bishop's assessment of the financial risk of the litigation, raising the concern that churches, including hers, could be lost. Thus, it was possible that plaintiff was denied a fair trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and the victim attended the same high school. The court first held that given the nature and purpose of the stalking law, the definitions of unlawful restraint under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect;&sect; 2404 applied to stalking as defined in Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 1061. It held that defendant's actions did not rise to a level that would cause a reasonable person to have a fear of unlawful restraint. Almost all of the interaction between defendant and the victim occurred at school in public areas or at school-related public activities. There was no evidence that defendant tried to get the victim alone in a private setting. Furthermore, the victim did not testify that she feared unlawful restraint or bodily injury. The victim did not clearly indicate that she wanted no further contact with defendant until September of their senior year, and he was arrested in October; thus, the period in which he was on clear notice that his contact was unwanted was very short in relation to cases where stalking had been found. There was almost no attempt to enlist the assistance of third parties. Furthermore, the behavior of defendant was often more awkward than deliberate.</SPAN></P>

Code R. &sect; 26 020 016-1, Department of Liquor Control General Regulation 17 (GR 17), by allowing two intoxicated patrons to loiter on the premises. The licensee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A team of liquor control investigators observed the licensee's dance floor for about 10 minutes and determined that one male patron appeared intoxicated. His friend also appeared drunk. The court first held that GR 17 did not exceed the Board's authority under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 7, &sect; 104. Enforcing the regulation depended solely upon observing demonstrably intoxicated patrons remaining inside licensed establishments. The Board was not required to define anything beyond its expertise in enforcing GR 17. Furthermore, GR 17 specifically tied together loitering with the state of intoxication. Next, &quot;loiter&quot; was not impermissibly vague under the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The manager's testimony showed that he understood GR 17 as prohibiting a licensee from allowing an intoxicated person to remain on the premises. In requiring that a patron be intoxicated and allowed to remain on the premises before a violation could be found, it defined the prohibited conduct with sufficient clarity to prevent arbitrary enforcement. Finally, the licensee had violated GR 17. Licensees could not avoid responsibility by failing to notice at least one obvious drunk for over 10 minutes.</SPAN></P>

Because the issue of defendants' easement right had been litigated, plaintiffs were now barred from trying to recharacterize the nature of that right. Plaintiffs were simply attempting to apply a new legal theory to the same facts in a second action. There had been a full and fair opportunity to litigate the nature of the right-of-way the first time, and additional legal theories were now foreclosed. The issue in the first case--the nature of defendants' interest in the right of way--went to the heart of plaintiffs' claim in this action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Vermont Labor Relations Board reinstated appellee grievant to his position as a game warden and awarded him back pay after he was discharged for falsifying a time report. Appellant State of Vermont challenged the Board's decision. It argued that the Board erred in excluding certain admissions by the grievant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board found that the State had violated a provision of the collective bargaining agreement that required advising an employee of his right to have a union representative present. Accordingly, it precluded the State from relying on an admission by the grievant. The court first noted that the Board had not adopted the exclusionary rule or the fruit-of-the-poisonous tree doctrine, but had analogized to those principles in considering the appropriate remedy. In doing so, it acted within its scope of authority under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 3, &sect; 982(g). There was nothing in the record, however, to show that the State gained any advantage from the grievant's single admission at the meeting in question. Therefore, any taint was far too attenuated for the Board to preclude the State from thereafter questioning the grievant about its suspicions that preceded the improper question. The presence of the union representative at subsequent interrogations guaranteed the grievant's procedural rights. Thus, there was no basis for the Board either to exclude the admissions the grievant made during those interviews or to limit the State's examination of him concerning those admissions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the Board's decision. It remanded the matter for the Board to reopen the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 7131 in which he argued that his sentence for DUI-Second Offense was enhanced by an improper conviction for a first offense of DUI. The Chittenden Superior Court (Vermont) dismissed the petition as moot. Petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the time of his petition, which argued that his plea of guilty to DUI in 1992 violated the Sixth Amendment, petitioner was on probation for a 2005 DUI. After he filed his petition, his sentence expired, and the State filed a motion for dismissal. The court stated that the fact that the trial court had jurisdiction when the petition was filed did not mean that the action was not moot when the trial court considered the motion to dismiss. There was no relief left to be ordered; petitioner was no longer subject to any enhanced sentence that could be corrected by court order. Although petitioner argued that his case was not moot because he could achieve one less conviction or an earlier reinstatement of his license, he could not achieve these goals, as there was no jurisdiction to vacate his 1992 conviction. The challenge was to the enhanced sentence rather than the fact of the 1992 conviction. There was no merit to the argument that there were collateral negative consequences that warranted keeping the controversy alive. The length of his license suspension was beyond the reach of postconviction relief, and any prospect that petitioner's fine might be reduced was slight to nil.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who entered his plea in 2004, argued that the court's decision in Provost required reversal of his sentence. The court held that defendant's sentencing was not plain error. The plea bargain, though not precisely congruent with Provost, which had not yet been decided at the time, was entirely consonant with the state of the law at the time it was struck. Neither Apprendi nor Blakely clearly mandated, as Provost did, that juries find the absence of mitigating factors. Defendant agreed in open court with counsel present that he would bear the burden of showing that his culpability, and therefore his sentence, should be reduced because he acted in sudden passion. His consent was given after a meticulous and thorough plea colloquy. Next, defendant had waived the insanity defense. His decision to present mental-state evidence only in support of a lesser sentence was a tactical one. Furthermore, defendant never formally raised the insanity defense as required by Vt. R. Crim. P. 12.1(a). Finally, the trial court did not err in finding that defendant's mental state did not significantly reduce his culpability. It had carefully weighed the competing testimony from two doctors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After receiving a presentence investigation (PSI) report, the trial court declined to accept defendant's recommended sentence, and he withdrew his guilty plea. The court first rejected the State's argument that the record was inadequate for review because defendant had not opened the door to the impeachment evidence by testifying. The court's evaluation of defendant's claim did not depend on a fact-specific balancing of prejudicial effect against probative value, and the importance of the trial court's ruling to defendant's decision not to testify was manifest, as the statements concerned the only element at issue at trial, lack of consent. Next, under Vt. R. Crim. P. 11 and Vt. R. Evid. 410, statements made during the course of a plea-related PSI were inadmissible against a defendant when the plea was later withdrawn, whether those statements were offered for impeachment or for their substance. Neither rule contained an exception for impeachment, and such an interpretation was supported by legislative history and case law.

Ann. tit. 3, &sect; 814(c), regarding summary suspension of licenses, facially violated the Due Process Clause, this claim was also moot as the physician was not currently under summary suspension. The &quot;capable of repetition, but evading review&quot; exception did not apply, as the physician had not suggested that he was likely to be subject to another summary suspension or disciplinary proceeding. Finally, the trial court had held that the damage claims should await the conclusion of the Board proceeding. Because the Board had issued its final decisions, these claims could now be considered by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dismissed as moot the physician's claims seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. It remanded for reconsideration of the physician's claims for money damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff insured challenged additional premium charges imposed by its workers' compensation carrier. The Workers' Compensation Board affirmed the additional charge. On appeal, the Commissioner of Banking, Insurance, Securities and Health Care Administration affirmed the Board's decision. The insured appealed. It argued that under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 601, it was not required to secure workers' compensation for three subcontractors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insured was a real estate developer. It subcontracted its construction work to various companies, including the three at issue here. Two of the subcontractors were sole proprietors, and the third was a corporation owned by a single person. The court first agreed with the Commissioner that the sole-proprietor exemptions under &sect; 601(14)(F) only affected the scope of a contractor's obligations to provide coverage for individuals under the contractor's employment. Those exemptions did not affect the obligations an insured had toward those same individuals when they were working for the insured. Such an interpretation furthered the remedial objectives of the workers' compensation statute. Next, the court rejected the insured's argument that it was not a statutory employer under &sect; 601(3). Applying a &quot;nature of the business&quot; test, the court noted that the insured was operating as a developer and as a builder at the project in question. The land was not saleable without residential units on it, so the insured's customary business, selling the land, required it to build the buildings. The services the subcontractors provided were central to the successful completion of the project.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. tit. 20, &sect; 1933 (Supp. 2007). The Addison District Court (Vermont) required one defendant to provide a sample, and the Chittenden District Court (Vermont) granted the other nine defendants' motions to dismiss. The first defendant and the State filed appeals, which were consolidated for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that under Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 11, convicted nonviolent felons could be required by Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 20, &sect;&sect; 1931 - 1946 to provide DNA samples for inclusion in DNA databases. Using a &quot;special needs&quot; analysis, the court stated that the statute sought to use DNA to accurately and efficiently identify persons in a variety of contexts, including subsequent criminal prosecutions. These goals were beyond the normal goals of law enforcement. Balancing the competing public and private interests at stake, the court stated that the intrusions occasioned by the statute were minimal and, like a fingerprint database, revealed nothing more than mere identity. The searches authorized were subject to clear administrative guidelines and were performed uniformly on all felons subject to them. Furthermore, the accuracy of DNA, and its concomitant ability to conclusively exonerate the innocent, weighed heavily in favor of the statute. Although the State's interest in DNA testing was more compelling with regard to violent felons, the effectiveness of the State's plan did not have to be high where the objective was significant and the privacy intrusion limited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Vermont State Hospital (VSH) provided inpatient psychiatric care. It was determined that the VSH had to be closed. The Department explored options for its replacement and applied for a conceptual certificate of need. BISHCA's Public Oversight Commission (POC) recommended approval of the Department's proposal. The Commissioner issued a final decision granting the conceptual certificate of need. The VSEA argued that his decision was vague and internally inconsistent. The supreme court held that the Commissioner's decision was not sufficiently vague or ambiguous to overcome its highly deferential standard of review. The Commissioner clearly stated that the Department was required to consider alternative options. His adoption of the POC's findings, but not its recommendations, did not render the decision as a whole ambiguous. The statute gave ultimate decision-making authority to the Commissioner to adopt or ignore, in whole or in part, any of the POC's findings and recommendations. His decision outlined lengthy findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 9440(d)(6)(B)(i).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant lived in a remote area. A local forest official suspected that he was responsible for marijuana plants that were growing in the National Forest. A Marijuana Eradication Team flew over defendant's property and discovered two plots of marijuana growing about 100 feet from defendant's house. Defendant argued that an unconstitutional aerial surveillance of his property resulted in the issuance of a search warrant that lead to the discovery of his marijuana cultivation. The supreme court held that the warrantless aerial surveillance violated defendant's constitutionally protected privacy right. Vermont citizens had a constitutional right to privacy that ascended into the airspace above their homes and property. Defendant showed that he had a subjective expectation of privacy in his back yard by taking precautions to exclude others from his yard. The actions of law enforcement, which flew only 100 feet above the ground for up to thirty minutes over defendant's home, were an unreasonable intrusion of privacy. The warrant authorizing the search of the premises was obtained solely on the basis of the aerial observations. Therefore, the evidence seized should have been excluded.</SPAN></P>

The inmate had pled guilty in 2001 to second-degree murder and had been sentenced to 35-years-to-life imprisonment. The presumptive sentence at that time was 20-years-to-life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 2001, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 2303 allowed a court to deviate from the presumptive term for homicide if it found by a preponderance of the evidence that aggravating or mitigating factors justified the deviation. The inmate's trial court found that aggravating factors supported a deviation. The sentencing scheme was ruled unconstitutional by the Provost decision. Provost did not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. The inmate asserted that although he pled guilty to second-degree murder, he was actually sentenced to a penalty for aggravated second-degree murder. Thus, he argued that Provost implicated the accuracy and fundamental fairness of his underlying conviction, making it a watershed rule deserving retroactive application to his case. The supreme court disagreed.  The inmate's sentence was below the minimum life imprisonment sentence for aggravated murder. Also, the statutory aggravating factors for sentence-enhancement under &sect; 2303, and the elements for an aggravated murder conviction under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 2311 were different.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Regarding the inmate's argument that the superior court shifted the burden of proof from the State to him on his prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel claims because the State's assertions merely denied the allegations of the petition without provision of, and citation to, supporting materials, the supreme court rejected this claim because the State's summary judgment motion was supported by documentary evidence, consisting of specific references to the trial record. However, summary judgment was inappropriate as to the inmate's ineffective assistance claims based on counsel's failure to conduct a pretrial investigation, prepare a defense, or interview witnesses because the State set forth only conclusory statements that he would be unable to prove that counsel failed to conduct an adequate investigation, present a defense, or interview witnesses, or alternatively that such omissions had no reasonable probability of affecting the outcome of the case.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In its Provost decision, rendered after defendants had exhausted their direct appeals, the court held that &sect; 2303 violated the Sixth Amendment because any fact that increased the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum had to be submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendants argued that Provost should be given full retroactive effect and they therefore should be resentenced. The court stated that Provost announced a new rule in that it significantly altered understanding of the protections required by the Sixth Amendment in sentencing. Thus, it applied retrospectively only to cases pending on direct appeal unless it qualified as an extraordinary case. The court held that it did not. The rule in Provost concerned only procedural questions: who determined sentence-enhancing factors and under what standard of proof. It did not affect the accuracy or the fundamental fairness of defendants' convictions. Similarly, the sentencing procedure established by Provost was not a fundamental component of a fair trial. The rule simply extended the reach of a defendant's right to a jury trial and the State's burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In response to defendant's multiple assignments of error, the supreme court concluded that, inter alia: (1) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying individual voir dire on the issue of exposure to pretrial publicity, as the jurors were questioned about their ability to put outside information aside and rely only on the evidence in the case; (2) exclusion of reenactment evidence was not erroneous as the court found that its probative value was outweighed by the potential for unfair prejudice and likelihood it would confuse and mislead the jury; (3) exclusion of evidence of remedial measures taken by the boat manufacturer was not error, as the defense expert's opinion was based on his own experience, examination of the boat, laws of physics, and the manufacturer's express warnings; (4) the jury instruction on defendant's right not to testify did not violate Vt. Const. Decl. Rights art. 10, the Fifth Amendment, or Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 6601; and (5) defendant's second conviction could not stand because death resulting was not included in the actus reus of Vt. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate appealed the order of the Chittenden Superior Court (Vermont), which treated the inmate's motion as one for post-conviction relief (PCR) and denied it, stating that, pursuant to Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 7134, the court was not required to entertain a second or successive motion for similar relief on behalf of the same inmate. The inmate's motion for reconsideration was also denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the inmate raised several issues. The state supreme court concluded that, to the extent that the inmate's motion was properly construed as one for PCR, the superior court properly declined to rule on its merits. The inmate's claims--that his underlying murder conviction was unconstitutional and that asserted infirmities were not raised at trial due to ineffective assistance of counsel--were all plainly barred from relitigation under the PCR statutes because the inmate's claims did not clearly differ in substance from those already raised and ruled upon in the inmate's many prior petitions. In addition, even though the inmate argued that the motion was one for extraordinary relief under Vt. R. App. P. 21, the motion did not address Vt. R. App. P. 21 in any way. Vt. R. App. P. 21(b) required that the inmate demonstrate the reasons why there was no adequate remedy by appeal or proceedings for extraordinary relief in the superior courts. The inmate's briefs on appeal failed to meet the rule's requirements. The inmate failed to show that he was entitled to relief under any theory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the District Court of Vermont, Unit No. 2, Chittenden Circuit, of two counts of lewd and lascivious conduct with a child, in violation of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 2602, and one count of furnishing drugs to a child, in violation of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4237(a). The trial court sentenced defendant to two concurrent sentences as a habitual criminal under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 11. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court failed to enforce a subpoena against a federal officer, that a supplemental jury instruction confused the jury, and that the trial court improperly relied on adult convictions obtained when defendant was a minor in finding that he was a habitual criminal. On appeal, the court found that defendant's compulsory process rights under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Vt. Const. Decl. Rights art. 10 were not violated as the officer's testimony would have served no exculpatory purpose, the information sought from the officer was public information available from other sources, and the subpoena for the officer's appearance was not timely filed under the federal court's rules. Further, because the reviewing court presumed that the jury followed all of the trial court's instructions, the supplemental instruction given did not deprive defendant of his right to a fair trial and was not error. Finally, the trial court did not err in counting defendant's convictions in adult court, despite his minority, toward habitual-criminal status under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 11, and did not offend the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that the post-conviction court erred in dismissing the request for PCR under &sect; 7131 because the language the post-conviction court relied on affected venue only and did not limit a court's subject matter jurisdiction over a request for PCR. The supreme court further held that the inmate could go forward with his claims, even though he did not raise them in his first request for PCR, to the extent the inmate could demonstrate (1) cause for not raising the issues previously and (2) prejudice if the issues were not heard. Claims that did not meet that standard, as well as those claims actually raised and decided on the merits in connection with the inmate's first request for PCR, were properly barred from relitigation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a prisoner's estate, brought a wrongful death action against various defendants, which included employees and agents of the Department of Corrections (also a defendant) and its health care providers. After one such provider (the physician) was dismissed from the lawsuit, he was reinstated by the Chittenden Superior Court, Vermont. He then filed an interlocutory appeal, seeking reversal of the superior court's order of reinstatement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The physician contended that, while the estate completed service within the time allowed by a court-granted extension under Vt. R. Civ. P. 6, the action against him was time-barred because service occurred outside the 60 days provided for in Vt. R. Civ. P. 3. His argument failed because the Vermont civil rules did not prohibit Vt. R. Civ. P. 6 to extend the time for service in Vt. R. Civ. P. 3. The mere fact that such extensions were not contemplated in Vt. R. Civ. P. 4 did not prohibit a Vt. R. Civ. P. 6 extension to the Vt. R. Civ. P. 3 time limitation, given that commentary to other rules and the court's own precedent was to the contrary. Moreover, Vt. R. Civ. P. 6 was applicable to any time limit, except those specifically exempted from its scope, and time for service was not expressly excluded. Thus, the court made it explicit that a properly granted Rule 6 extension could extend time for service under Vt. R. Civ. P. 3. The argument that allowing extensions for service would circumvent the statute of limitations failed, since the tolling of the statute of limitations was governed by statute, and the time permitted for service was a procedural matter controlled by rules.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The superior court's order reinstating the physician as a defendant was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an interlocutory appeal, the State appealed a ruling of the District Court of Vermont, Unit No. 1, Windham Circuit, that it could not use defendants' convictions for driving while ability impaired (DWAI) from New York for purposes of enhancing a charge of driving under the influence in Vermont pursuant to Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 1211, and the grant of defendants' motions to strike.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State argued that under &sect; 1211, previous convictions of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 1201 included violations of any law related to driving under the influence. The state's highest court held that under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 1211, a violation of present or prior law of Vermont or any other jurisdiction that prohibited the operation of a vehicle while under the influence was tantamount to a violation of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 1201. The New York convictions were such law. Vermont's right to a jury trial under Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 10 was not imputed to Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 1211. An out-of-state conviction obtained in compliance with the law of another State or the Federal Constitution could be used for enhancement purposes. Defendants' nonjury DWAI convictions were consistent with the New York and Federal Constitutions. The fact that &sect; 1211 did not enumerate every act that might constitute a violation did not render it unconstitutionally vague. Finally, defendants could not claim to have been held criminally responsible for conduct that they could not reasonably understand to be proscribed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district court granted the district's motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Vt. R. Civ. P. 50(b). The court ruled that appellant suffered no compensable business less, and set it aside that part of the verdict that awarded appellant an additional $ 4.8 million for business loss. Appellant argued that the court erred in granting the motion and that the court should have awarded it interest to make the valuation current. Appellant had contested both the necessity for the taking and, after necessity was determined, the compensation offered by the district. This appeal arose from the damages phase of the condemnation. The state supreme court held that the lower court properly determined that appellant was not entitled to compensation for business loss or to prejudgment interest. Though many states viewed injury to or destruction of a business upon lands taken by eminent domain as too uncertain, remote or speculative to be compensable, Vermont specifically identified business loss as a reimbursable item of damage in a condemnation proceeding. Vt. Stat. Ann., tit. 19, &sect; 501(2). Business loss was not unlimited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of an order entered by the District Court of Vermont, Unit No. 2, Chittenden Circuit, which denied his motion to suppress evidence as a result of a search of his automobile. Defendant had entered a conditional plea of guilty to one count of possession of ecstasy and had received a suspended sentence of two to five years and an order of restitution, all stayed pending the outcome of his appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was pulled over by the police after he was observed weaving and driving in excess of the speed limit. Subsequently, defendant was arrested for driving under the influence, handcuffed, and placed in the rear of the police cruiser. The officer searched the vehicle under the &quot;incident-to-arrest&quot; doctrine. The search disclosed, inter alia, a pipe with burnt residue and an empty beer can and a glass jar containing marijuana. A later search pursuant to a warrant of a backpack on the back seat disclosed the drug ecstasy. Rejecting the federal Fourth Amendment standard set forth in New York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454 (1981), which applied the search-incident-to-arrest doctrine, the court held that a more protective standard under Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 11 required that exigent circumstances had to be shown to justify the warrantless search to secure the officer's safety or preserve evidence of the crime. Because defendant had been handcuffed and placed in the police cruiser, no objective basis existed for the officer to fear for his safety, and the officer testified that he had no such fear; defendant also was incapable of destroying any evidence under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's order denying defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court disagreed. It found that she was required to have been actively engaged in law practice for five of the 10 preceding years but that her teaching experience was not the equivalent of actively practicing law. It also found that Massachusetts required that she have practiced at least five of the 10 preceding years and that she had not shown that the Vermont Rules of Admission, which rationally assisted the state in identifying competent practitioners, violated her federal constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed the conviction, arguing that the trial court improperly instructed the jury to consider whether defendant was &quot;practically certain&quot; that her conduct would cause public inconvenience or annoyance, when she was charged with intentionally causing public inconvenience or annoyance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested at an anti-war demonstration which blocked traffic at an intersection. The State charged defendant with disorderly conduct, alleging that defendant and the other protesters, with intent to cause public inconvenience and annoyance, obstructed vehicular traffic, in violation of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 1026(5). Defendant admitted to blocking traffic but stated that her only intention in doing so was to protest the war in Iraq, not to cause public inconvenience or annoyance. The trial court instructed the jury that intent could be shown if the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was practically certain that another person or persons would be bothered, disturbed, irritated, or harassed. The state supreme court held that under the Trombley doctrine, the &quot;practically certain&quot; instruction was erroneous. The supreme court further held that the error was not harmless. The instruction given may have led the jury to ignore any evidence of defendant's intent and to convict solely based on her knowledge. The effect of the erroneous instruction was analogous to a directed verdict for the State.</SPAN></P>

The corporate entities claimed that the town and town treasurer exceeded its taxing authority under 32 Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect; 5254(a) regarding tax sales of the corporate entities' properties on which delinquent taxes were owed. The corporate entities appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporate entities were delinquent in paying certain property taxes. The town gave the corporate entities notice of tax sales regarding them. After the corporate entities did not pay, the town conducted tax sales to satisfy the delinquent tax payments. The corporate entities later sued the town and town treasurer, and claimed that the town exceeded its taxing authority under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect; 5254(a) by collecting &quot;interest&quot; and &quot;penalties&quot; through the tax sales and by retaining the excess proceeds during the redemption period. The corporate entities also claimed an unconstitutional taking had occurred. The trial court granted the town and town treasurer's summary judgment motion. On appeal, the state supreme court found that reading the statutory scheme as a whole, the town was authorized to collect interest and penalties pursuant to Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect; 5254(a) to avoid an absurd construction of the statutory scheme. It also found that the statutory scheme did not entitle the corporate entities to hold the tax sale proceeds during the redemption period and no unconstitutional taking occurred since the retention of the tax sales proceeds was not a taking.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, the tenants of a building that defendant, the Vermont Department of Labor and Industry, was trying to close for housing code violations, sought relief in the nature of mandamus alleging the Department's abuse of authority. They also asserted due process and takings claims and moved for class certification. The Franklin Superior Court, Vermont, dismissed the complaint and denied the motion for class certification. The tenants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tenants alleged that the Department used a voluntary enforcement scheme with respect to housing code violations. In other words, they alleged that the Department failed to take any action to ensure compliance with housing code provisions or its own specific orders until a building was deemed imminently hazardous. Such a system, if it was, indeed, the system the Department had implemented, represented an arbitrary abuse of power that amounted to a failure to comply with its legal duties. Because the tenants' complaint alleged that such a system was in place, it stated a claim in the nature of mandamus under Vt. R. Civ. P. 75. The complaint also stated a takings claim against the Department under both the U.S. and Vermont constitutions, U.S. Const. amend. V, Vt. Const. ch. I, &sect; 2, by alleging that the Department's choice to enforce the state housing code only as a last resort deprived them of all beneficial use of their homes. However, the complaint did not state a U.S. Const. amend. XIV due process claim against the Department. As for the motion for class certification, the proposed class definition was overbroad and therefore did not meet the requirements of Vt. R. Civ. P. 23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The superior court's judgment was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The dismissals of the tenants' due process claim and the denial of class certification were affirmed. The dismissals of the tenants' claim in the nature of mandamus under Vt. R. Civ. P. 75 and their takings claim were reversed as being premature and remanded so that the tenants could attempt to prove their allegations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court in the malpractice case had held that the client had waived his right to a jury trial. The court rejected the client's argument that Vt. R. Civ. P. 38(d), which stated that a jury demand not filed timely was waived, was invalid. Rules consistent with Vt. Const. ch. II, &sect; 38 could require that a party give reasonable notice of his intention to avail himself of his right to a jury. Next, the client argued that his jury demand in his amended complaint was timely. The court stated that the amended complaint had not raised a new issue, only a new theory, and therefore did not revive the right to trial by jury. Finally, the client argued that the trial court had erred in failing to decide that the attorney's substandard representation required that he refund the client's legal fees. The fees charged by the attorney were not caused by the attorney's malpractice but were charged irrespective of the quality of his representation. If the client had incurred legal fees to correct the adverse consequences of the attorney's malpractice, those fees might be recoverable because they were caused by the malpractice, but the client here had apparently not incurred such fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commissioner of Labor and Industry (Vermont) denied a claimant's request for a lump-sum payment of his permanent total disability (PTD) workers' compensation benefits. The Commissioner held that a 2000 amendment to Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 652(b), allowing PTD benefits to be paid in a lump sum, was a substantive change to the law that could not be given retroactive effect. The claimant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant was injured in 1998. Before &sect; 652(b) was amended in 2000, there was no lump-sum payment option as an alternative to weekly payments. The court stated that the controlling law in determining the retroactive effect of an amendment was Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 1, &sect; 214(b)(2), which stated that the amendment of an act would not affect any right existing before the effective date of the amendment. This rule applied to remedial changes as well. Thus, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 652(b) could be applied only if allowing the Commissioner to order lump sum payments would not affect any right acquired prior to the amendment's effective date. A claimant acquired the right to receive compensation at the time of his injury. Furthermore, a change in the method of the payments substantially affected the claimant's right to compensation and the employer's obligation to provide it. Thus, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 1, &sect; 214(b)(2) prohibited retroactive application of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 652(b) to injuries that predated its enactment. The court rejected the argument that &sect; 652(b) should apply retroactively under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 1, &sect; 213. Section 213 applied only to new enactments.</SPAN></P>

A magistrate revoked the mother's driver's license under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 798 when she failed to make payments on the judgment. The mother appealed to the Orleans Family Court (Vermont), which affirmed the magistrate's ruling. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother lived in a religious community where the members lived together and shared all things in common. She was 51 years old and had a twelfth-grade education. As a member of the community, she received a pro rata share of its income. The mother claimed that she lacked the ability to pay the judgment. The court stated that the magistrate had found a present ability to pay based on the mother's pro rata share of the community income and her age, health, and education. This was in accordance with the definition of &quot;available income&quot; in Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 653, which included in-kind payments that reduced living expenses. Next, even under the most stringent test, the license suspension did not infringe upon the free exercise of the mother's religious beliefs. The father, a former community member, had testified that the mother could serve the church in ways not requiring a driver's license, and the magistrate had found this persuasive. Finally, the magistrate had not abused her discretion in refusing to grant a continuance of the license suspension hearing. The mother had sought a continuance for health reasons, but there was no evidence that she could not travel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State of Vermont filed criminal charges against defendant gas station owners in the District Court of Vermont, Unit No. 2, Chittenden Circuit, for recklessly releasing gasoline into the environment. The court ordered the State to produce materials sought in discovery to support the owners' claim of selective prosecution to allow one of the owners to depose computer systems administrators for State agencies. The State appealed the orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners contended that they were selectively prosecuted because the president of one of the owners exercised his First Amendment right to free speech by testifying against an administrative fee before a legislative committee. The owners therefore sought to conduct discovery to support their contention. The owner which had opposed the administrative fee also sought to depose computer systems administrators employed by administrative agencies to discover whether it was possible to resurrect certain e-mails which the owner believed existed at one time but which the State was unable to produce. On appeal, the court found that discovery could not be allowed on selective prosecution grounds absent a threshold showing of some evidence of each element in the selective prosecution claim as the government of the State was a government of balanced powers, Vt. Const. ch. II, &sect; 5, and prosecutorial power resided with the executive, Vt. Const. ch. II, &sect; 20. Moreover, the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the depositions to go forward without first requiring the owner to explain why written material provided by the State fell short and what additional information the owner sought.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The orders were reversed, and the case was remanded for the trial court to consider whether an owner was entitled to the selective prosecution discovery which it sought. Further, the owner was to explain why written material provided by the State fell short and what additional information the owner sought to obtain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with driving under the influence of intoxicants, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 1201, 8th Offense, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 1210; possession of cocaine in an amount of 2.5 grams or more, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect;&sect; 4205, 4231(a)(2); and misdemeanor driving with license suspended, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 674. The District Court of Vermont, Unit No. 2, Rutland Circuit required bail of $ 60,000 in cash. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While the cash-only bail imposed by the trial court was arguably authorized by Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 7554(a)(1)(F), defendant claimed that &sect;&nbsp;7554(a)(1)(F) violated Vt. Const. ch. II, &sect;&nbsp;40. The supreme court held that to the extent Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 7554(a)(1)(F) permitted imposition of cash-only bail, it violated Vt. Const. ch. II, &sect; 40. The supreme court noted that the distinction between a secured appearance bond and a cash-only bail was significant from the standpoint of a defendant's liberty interests, and that bother an appearance bond and a cash-only bail served the court's legitimate purpose of securing a defendant's appearance at trial. The supreme court concluded that to construe the &quot;sufficient sureties&quot; clause as permitting cash-only bail would increase government power to engage in pre-trial confinement, a result which could not be reconciled with the history of the &quot;sufficient sureties&quot; clause or Vermont's cases discussing bail, in which the court recognized the threat to individual liberty inherent in pretrial detention. The cash-only bail imposed was, in effect, a denial of bail under circumstances that were not constitutionally permissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The District Court of Vermont, Unit No. 2, Chittenden Circuit (Vermont) granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence of a roadside stop made by a University of Vermont and State Agricultural College (UVM) police officer as well as defendant's motions to dismiss the driving under the influence charge and civil suspension proceeding that resulted from the stop.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A UVM officer found defendant behind the wheel and noticed that defendant's eyes were watery and bloodshot, that his speech was slurred, and there was an alcohol container behind the passenger seat. Defendant was arrested for driving under the influence. The appellate court held that in enacting Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 2283, the Legislature properly delegated the UVM police power to a state instrumentality. The creation of the police force implicated and promoted UVM's educational mission such that UVM was properly viewed as a state instrumentality. Thus, there was no plain and palpable invasion of constitutional rights, resulting from the passage of &sect; 2283 or the existence and operation of the UVM's police department. The appellate court rejected the reasoning of defendant and the trial court and held that &sect; 2283 did not delegate police power to a private entity beyond the control of the people and their legal representatives. The complaint mechanism did not render the UVM police department unanswerable to the people.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of second-degree murder in the Rutland District Court, Unit No. 2 (Vermont).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant said her husband committed suicide. The supreme court held sufficient evidence supported her murder conviction. Gunshot residue on his hands was inconsistent with him having shot himself. The jury could reasonably find he did not want or try to take his own life. Defendant's accountant's testimony that defendant said she wanted to kill her husband was relevant. The witness's disclaimer of the statements as &quot;figures of speech&quot; did not make them irrelevant. The statements were probative and not unduly prejudicial. The trial court correctly defined circumstantial evidence and then told the jury only circumstantial evidence could support a conviction. The presence of a mitigating factor did not require the trial court to reduce defendant's minimum sentence. Any error in balancing aggravating and mitigating factors was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court limited consideration of defendant's failure to accept responsibility to sentencing and its impact on her rehabilitation and protection of the public. As defendant never obtained in forma pauperis status, she was correctly denied a free transcript.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the order of the District Court of Vermont, Unit No. 1, Windham Circuit, which, following a conviction of two counts of cruelty to animals in violation of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 352, ordered defendant to repay the costs of providing care to animals seized from her prior to trial without first determining her ability to pay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in entering judgment against her for the costs of providing care to her animals without determining her ability to pay. The state supreme court found that the plain meaning of the statutory language in Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 353(b)(2) did not require the trial court to find an ability to pay before ordering defendant to pay the reasonable costs of caring for her animals. In addition, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 354(g)(1) required defendants convicted of cruelty to animals to repay all reasonable costs incurred by the custodial caregiver for caring for the animal, including veterinary expenses. Thus, not only did the trial court not have to determine defendant's ability to pay prior to ordering her to pay reasonable costs, it had no discretion to award any amount less than reasonable costs. In addition, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in choosing an amount of costs to assess. The trial court found, within its exercise of discretion, that the vast majority of the costs were reasonable.

App. P. 14, certified to the court the following question, which was accepted for review: &quot;Are the City of Burlington's rights under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 30, &sect; 2514, which remained following the abandonment of the railroad easement pursuant to Proctor, in the nature of a common law easement, or limited to maintaining the lines that existed prior to the abandonment?&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff landowners sought to prevent defendant city from adding a fiber optic line to existing utility poles and lines that ran through their property along a path and former railroad right-of-way. The supreme court found that under the reasoning in Proctor, the statutory right provided by Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 30, &sect;&sect; 2513-2514 and predecessor statutes was in the nature of an easement in the sense that the right entitled utilities to use the railroad right-of-way in a manner that did not materially burden the landowner beyond what was originally intended by the conveyance or condemnation of the right-of-way. The legislative intent in enacting &sect;&sect; 2513-2514 and predecessor statutes was to allow utilities to continue to provide electric and telecommunications services within railroad rights-of-way even after railroad operations ceased. This statutory right was in the nature of an express easement and thus was subject to an increase-in-burden analysis under the common law. Utilities could continue to use the right-of-ways for their intended purposes so long as the uses did not materially increase the burden for which the landowners or predecessors-in-title had already been compensated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court consolidated its review of appellant's direct appeal and his petition for post-conviction relief (PCR), with regard to appellant's challenge to his first-degree murder conviction. Defendant was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. Defendant's direct appeal came from the District Court of Vermont, Unit No. 2, Chittenden Circuit, and the petition for PCR came from the Chittenden Superior Court (Vermont).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's conviction arose from the killing of his wife. In his direct appeal, appellant argued that the district court erred by failing to suppress his confession; admitting evidence of his prior bad acts; and refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of voluntary manslaughter. In his appeal from the denial of his PCR petition, appellant contended that summary judgment was in error since genuine issues of material fact existed regarding his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The court found no reversible error with regard to the issues raised on direct appeal but did find that the district court erred in sentencing appellant by determining that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors, which was an issue that should have been determined by the jury. As to PCR, the court agreed that the superior court erred in only considering whether appellant's defense was prejudiced for ineffective assistance of counsel and not also considering whether counsel performed below an objective standard of reasonableness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed appellant's conviction, vacated his sentence, and remanded the case to the district court for resentencing. The court affirmed, in part, summary judgment regarding appellant's petition for PCR and reversed, in part, the petition and remanded it to the superior court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury in the District Court of Vermont, Unit No. 1, Windham Circuit, convicted defendant of criminal refusal to take a breath test for blood alcohol level under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 1201(b). Defendant appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 1201(b), made it a crime for a person suspected of driving under the influence (DUI) to refuse an officer's reasonable request for a breath test if that person had a prior DUI conviction. After being pulled over for speeding, defendant refused to take a breath test. At the station, defendant again refused after being read a standardized warning. On appeal, defendant argued that the language of the warning was so vague that it violated his due process rights. The appellate court held that the void for vagueness standard did not apply, as the right to advisement under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 1202(d) went above and beyond any due process requirement of statutory clarity. Thus, all that was required was that the warning convey the information listed in the statute. The warning given to defendant met that requirement. Defendant also argued that the State failed to prove that the request for a breath test was reasonable. The appellate court held that the clarity or lack of clarity in the warning had no bearing on the reasonableness of the request. The officer had ample grounds to request a test based on an number of clues suggesting intoxication.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant agreed the State could argue his conduct was second degree murder warranting a 27 to 30 year sentence. He agreed if the State proved by a preponderance of the evidence that this sentence was warranted, it could be imposed. The supreme court held he was not sentenced for second degree murder, under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 2303(b), but was sentenced for the crimes he admitted. As he was sentenced within the limits of the statutes and his plea agreement, he was not harmed. He agreed to let the trial court decide his sentence and knew he could receive 27 to 30 years, so he waived his right to contest the trial court's sentencing procedure. The State had to show he acted with wanton disregard of the likelihood that his conduct would cause the victim's death and that he did not kill her under provocation. It discredited the only provocation evidence, which was his statements, which were grossly inconsistent with the victim's injuries and other evidence, and it showed he did not immediately bring her to the hospital, and, when he did, he stopped to buy cigarettes on the way. The factual basis for his plea and his claim that he had a cut lip were not ignored at sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant contended the trial court erred by refusing to treat his claimed unconstitutional detention, and the trooper's alleged misuse of spike strips, as mitigating factors in sentencing him, that it improperly conferred victim status on two state troopers who witnessed the incident, and that it failed to consider his being was unaware of having struck the trooper as a mitigating circumstance. The court found that refusal to consider factors of the crime in mitigation was within the trial court's discretion because the spike strips and facts leading to defendant's detention did not prevent him from slowing down or stopping before killing the trooper. Moreover, even if consideration of the three brief statements made by fellow troopers was improper under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 5321(a)(2), any such error was harmless because defendant's recklessness and not the impact statements clearly were the driving force in defendant's sentencing. Finally, defendant's plea to hit and run automatically conferred actual or constructive knowledge of an injury from the accident requiring him to render aid under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 1128, on him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment on jury verdict of the Vermont District Court, Unit No. 3, Lamoille Circuit, convicting him of four counts of first-degree murder and sentencing him to consecutive sentences of life without parole. He argued that his statement should have been suppressed, that a State expert's report had not been properly disclosed, and that the sentencing statute,&nbsp;Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 2303, violated the Sixth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant shot four people to death, leaving at least one eyewitness alive. When he was questioned by police, he waived his Miranda rights. The court held that this also waived any rights to presence of counsel under the Vermont Public Defender Act, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect;&sect; 5201-5277, and when he invoked his right to remain silent, ending the questioning, this did not automatically invoke the right to counsel's presence, since the next procedure, a telephoned conference regarding availability of bail, was not the sort of formal procedure that required the presence of counsel. There was no discovery misconduct, and if defendant had wanted more detail regarding an expert's views, he should have deposed him. The life without parole statute,&nbsp;Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 2303, violated the Sixth Amendment as explicated in Apprendi and Blakely, because it required the judge to weigh factors not found by a jury. Therefore, the four consecutive terms were replaced with four presumptive terms, adding up to a term of 140 years before parole eligibility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction but vacated the sentence. It replaced the consecutive terms of life without parole with consecutive presumptive terms.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a group of students and a group of taxpayers, appealed from an order of the Washington Superior Court (Vermont) that dismissed for failure to state a claim, primarily on judicial restraint grounds, their action against defendants, the State, its education commissioner, and its board of education, arguing that the Vermont Equal Educational Opportunity Act of 1997 (Act 60) had violated the constitutional rights of both groups.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court had dismissed the students' and taxpayers' constitutional challenges to Act 60 on grounds that judicial restraint required it not to address issues that the legislature was trying to solve in a political manner. The legislature had, in fact, already replaced Act 60 with legislation that the State argued was more respectful of the rights of students and taxpayers. Nonetheless, the court held that the action alleging violation of the rights to equal protection under Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 7, to proportional taxation under Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 9, and to a free public education under Vt. Const. ch. II, &sect; 68, should not have been dismissed at such an early stage. It was a court's duty to determine the constitutionality of statutes, and an earlier case had already determined that the parties had standing to challenge Act 60. Even though the statute had been superseded, the challenge was not moot when the challengers alleged that the constitutional deficiencies had not been remedied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the District Court of Vermont, Unit No. II, Bennington Circuit, of first-degree aggravated domestic assault. He appealed, alleging that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront the victim, a convicted perjurer, and his due process rights by barring the victim's testimony at trial and by admitting into evidence an excited utterance the victim made after the assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was accused of pointing a gun at and threatening to kill the victim, his stepson. The victim told defendant's cousin that defendant had pulled a gun on him, that he was frightened, and that he thought defendant was going to kill him. The victim had been convicted of perjury and was therefore incompetent to testify under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 2907. The trial court admitted the victim's statement to the cousin as an excited utterance under Vt. R. Evid. 803(2). Defendant argued that his confrontation rights were violated because the statement was &quot;testimonial&quot; within the meaning of Crawford. The appellate court disagreed. The statement was not &quot;testimonial&quot; because it was not given to police and was not made during the course of the police investigation; the victim was excitedly expressing his fear to a friend. Admission of the hearsay did not violate Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 2907 because the victim did not make his statement under oath. Defendant had no constitutional right to call the victim as a witness because his statement was not testimonial for purposes of the Confrontation Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer hired an employee to work as a part-time waitress and bartender on an as-needed basis. The employee continued to work for the employer after she obtained a full-time position elsewhere. The employee applied for unemployment benefits when she left her full-time job. The Board found that the employer contacted the employee when it needed her services and, at the end of each assignment, there was no guarantee that the employer would contact the employee again. The Board reasoned that the employment relationship did not continue beyond each assignment and that there was a termination or layoff after each assignment. The Board thus charged the employer's experience-rating record for a portion of the unemployment benefits paid to the employee. The employer argued that the employee was not terminated after each assignment as she was, and continued to be, an active employee. On appeal, the court found that the Board erred in charging the employer's experience-rating record for a share of the employee's unemployment benefits because the employer was entitled to the benefit of Vt.

The appellate court held that because defendant's objection below a different basis than that claimed on appeal, the issue was reviewed for plain error. The appellate court had held in an earlier appeal that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. The appellate court again held for the same reasons that the instant conviction was supported by sufficient evidence. The trial court admitted statements by the victim and a witness indicating that defendant had tried to rape the victim. The appellate court held that the challenged evidence was admissible as an excited utterance, and was relevant as tending to show that defendant had placed the victim in fear of bodily injury. Although not sufficient in and of itself to prove defendant's intent to inflict bodily injury, it supported the inference that the jury was entitled to draw from the violent nature of the attempted restraint and ensuing conduct.</SPAN></P>

The son then filed a petition in probate court to open an intestate estate, and alleged he was the decedent's child.

Evidence in the case showed that the decedent had denied paternity in legal documents executed near the time of the son's birth, that the decedent had never openly acknowledged the son as his child, and that the decedent had never been adjudicated to be the son's father. The son sought to present evidence of the genetic testing of the sisters to establish the decedent's paternity. The son and the sisters then filed competing summary judgment motions. The trial court granted the sisters' motion. On appeal, the state supreme court found that under applicable statutory law, the son, who was nearly 38-years-old, only had 21 years to file a motion for genetic testing and his constitutional rights were not violated by that statute barring genetic testing to establish paternity more than 21 years after his birth.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that emergency rulemaking procedures were not complied with by a state agency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Vermont Legislature delegated to the Vermont Secretary of Administration and the Joint Fiscal Committee (JFC) the authority to implement a deficit-prevention plan to address revenue shortfalls while the Legislature was not in session. After such a plan was implemented, the Vermont Department of Prevention, Assistance, Transition, and Health Access (PATH) utilized emergency rulemaking procedures. The individuals' challenge to the procedure was successful. On appeal, the court determined that 2001 Vt. Acts &amp; Resolves 142 (Adj. Sess.), &sect; 324 was not unconstitutional under Vt. Const. ch. II, &sect; 5. The delegation was valid because it involved shared powers at the intersection of branches of government. There were proper limiting standards to avoid the delegation of a law-making function. Also, the legislature was permitted to delegate its power over appropriation to JFC instead of the entire legislature; therefore, there was no violation of Vt. Const. ch. II, &sect; 2. PATH complied with the emergency rulemaking provisions in Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 3, &sect; 844(a).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent Vermont's Tax Cmmissioner reduced the education property tax prebate for a home owned 50 percent in common by petitioner taxpayer to 50 percent of the total allowable prebate. The Washington County, Vermont, Superior Court decided that Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32 , &sect; 6062(c), part of the prebate provisions of the education property tax code (Act 60), was constitutional and did not increase the taxpayer's prebate. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prebate was to equalize statewide education property tax rates and was based on household income. Only one prebate per household was allowed. The taxpayer and a New York resident friend owned the home as tenants in common, in equal shares, and, by agreement, the taxpayer lived there and paid all the home's expenses, including the property taxes. However, the courts held that Vermont could base the prebate on the percentage of home ownership, under &sect; 6062(c), rather than percentage of property taxes paid without violating constitutional provisions: (1) due process, (2) equal protection, and (3) consistency with Act 60's remedial purposes. Section 6062(c) did not create a nonrebuttable presumption that the taxpayer &quot;paid&quot; the taxes in proportion to ownership, as the prebate itself was based on percentage ownership, not tax payment. Allowing only 50 percent of the prebate to a tenant in common did not discriminate against unmarried couples for the same reason; it was an administratively efficient way to determine the prebate. To solve the &quot;consistency&quot; issue, the taxpayer's share of the prebate could be increased by a change in the co-tenants' self-imposed agreements.</SPAN></P>

The neighbor had filed a complaint against defendant shooting range (the range) alleging, among other things, that the noise from the range created a private nuisance. The neighbor had sought to permanently enjoin the range's operation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court had determined that at the time of the trial, the terms of the range's permit prohibited operations for a period of up to 10 years due to the range's violation of logging rules. As a result, the trial court determined an injunction was not available because there was no activity to enjoin. The neighbor contended on appeal that recent revisions to the range's permit, which allowed the range to re-open, rendered the trial court's opinion advisory and that a grant of statutory immunity under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 5227(b) effected an unconstitutional taking by depriving him of a remedy for the claimed nuisance. The court disagreed and upheld the trial court's judgment based on the equitable principles governing injunctions and justiciability in nuisance suits. The court did not reach the neighbor's statutory and constitutional grounds. The court held that the case was mooted by the involuntary and indefinite cessation of the range's activities as a result of its own permit violation. The fact that the range was permitted to reopen after the trial court had entered final judgment did not invalidate the trial court's decision, which was correct when it was entered.</SPAN></P>

Other patrons reacted by leaving the building. Defendant was charged and convicted of disorderly conduct. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that defendant's use of abusive or &quot;fighting words&quot; tended to incite an immediate breach of the peace. The court noted that defendant directed extremely vulgar and personally offensive insults at the server and hurled several items around the room in a fit of anger, and that defendant's behavior alarmed other patrons of the food shelf to the point where they felt compelled to leave.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer was informed that the Department would be seeking reimbursement for an educational tax prebate the taxpayer had received for the 1999 tax year. The taxpayer was also denied a prebate for the 2000 tax year. He appealed the Department's decision but continued to receive repayment demands from the Department and a collection agency. Because of the tax appeal, the taxpayer's account should have been placed on appeal status and he should not have received payment demands or collection notices. His &sect; 1983 action sought damages for his anxiety and emotional distress over the collection notice and the payment demands. The court affirmed the trial court, holding that (1) due process was satisfied because a tax appeal process existed; (2) the taxpayer's equal protection claim failed because he failed to show that he had received selective treatment based on an impermissible consideration of race, religion, or the intent to inhibit his exercise of constitutional rights; (3) statutory violations could not support the &sect; 1983 action, and (4) as defendants had not violated any clearly defined constitutional right, they were entitled to qualified immunity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On suspicion of inadequate care based on neighbors' complaints and a report from a veterinarian noting the horse's emaciated state, the society seized the owners' horse and kept it for 12 days.

The society successfully sought summary judgment on grounds that it was authorized to seize the horse pursuant to Vermont's animal cruelty statutes,&nbsp;Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect;&sect; 351-354. On appeal, the owners claimed that the animal cruelty statutes were unconstitutional. The court affirmed, but found that the trial court erred in holding that the owners' property right in &quot;12 days' possession of an old, blind, sick horse&quot; was de minimis and thus did not trigger due process protection. The court found that the owners' property interest in the horse was significant enough to trigger due process protection, but held that they were not denied due process because the degree of their deprivation was not serious, the procedures underlying the deprivation adequately addressed the potential for errors, and they could have requested a post-deprivation hearing under Vt.

Stat. Ann. tit. 9, &sect; 2453(a). The manufacturer cross-appealed the trial court's award of costs, which only granted part of the manufacturer's cost petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The consumers bought a van they thought was built in Japan after they became dissatisfied with their car, which was built by a domestic auto-maker.

The consumers asserted that a sticker on the van touting it as the number one import van violated &sect; 2453(a). The court affirmed the judgment against the consumers holding that the instructions on the Act given to the jury were proper and that testimony of an employee of the manufacturer was properly admitted as lay opinion testimony. The court partially reversed the cost award, holding that (1) the trial court should have addressed the manufacturer's request for witness fees permitted by Vt. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the District Court, Unit No. 1, Windham Circuit (Vermont), convicting him on jury verdict of seeking to bribe a police officer during a traffic stop. He argued that the trial court's decision to allow jurors to submit questions for witnesses deprived him of an impartial jury and a fair trial, and that it affected the State's burden of proof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Although defendant had not preserved his objections for review, the high court addressed the merits of his arguments to assure fairness in a situation where the rules of procedure did not explicitly require an objection to preserve the issue. That court had previously authorized a bar committee to study the issue of juror questions to witnesses, and the trial court's procedures followed those recommended by the committee. The high court proceeded to approve such questioning, so long as the recommended procedures were followed, in common with most other state and federal courts. The fear that jurors would become advocates was addressed by safeguards that included screening by the trial court and the fact that the judge actually asked any questions, by extensive cautionary instructions to jurors about the whole process, by the fact that all submissions were discussed with counsel, and by the fact that rulings on whether each question would be asked were made on the record. The procedures did not shift the burden of proof to defendant; it was customary to judge the sufficiency of the evidence based on evidence from many different sources, and the rule simply added a new source.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff female applicants appealed from the summary judgment granted to defendants, a local and a national fraternal club, by the Washington Superior Court (Vermont). The applicants argued the trial court erred in finding that the Fair Housing and Public Accommodations Act, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 9, &sect;&sect; 4500-4507, did not bar membership discrimination by fraternal lodges, and that genuine issues of material fact precluded summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Membership in a fraternal organization was covered by the Act if membership was essentially open to the public. The trial court, as the trier of fact, had to make factual findings for a determination of that issue. The clubs' selectivity was a very hotly disputed issue. While the applicants alleged that, in nine years, only 10 out of over 270 applications were rejected, the local club argued those numbers were misleading because many applicants failed to pass the first step: compatibility with existing members. The club argued it was far more selective than the final acceptance figures suggested. There was no indication that the trial court considered or reviewed those material allegations in determining that the clubs were more private than public. Summary judgment had been inappropriate. The applicants had alleged that the national club had substantial and direct supervisory responsibility over the local club, a representation vigorously disputed by the national club. A decision on the national club's liability had to await a more developed factual record. The Act was not void for vagueness. Given the posture of the case, the court declined to address a First Amendment claim.</SPAN></P>

Acts 71, &sect; 78, 1999 Vt. Acts 49, &sect; 32, which effected a freeze of the list valuation of hydroelectric generating facilities for property taxes, were constitutional. The utility also argued it was error to exclude fair market value evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under the rational basis test, the freeze was constitutional. The freeze temporarily stabilized revenues for small towns, in the face of difficulties in determining the fair market value of hydroelectric facilities brought about by the changing and deregulated utility market. That purpose was legitimate and important and did not violate Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 9. The large appraisal discrepancies of the utility's facility showed valuation uncertainty due to deregulation. The freeze allowed small towns to avoid lengthy, expensive, and unpredictable appraisals. There was a rational basis for singling out hydroelectric plants for a temporary freeze to allow for professional reappraisals and to protect revenues. Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 7, did not apply; there was no preferential benefit to any class of persons. While fair market value evidence in connection with allocation between the owners of the generating and transferring properties should have been allowed, that did not affect the constitutionality of the legislation. The legislation did not violate the right to a remedy under Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 4, tax appeals under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect; 4461, were undisturbed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant workers' compensation insurer sought review of the judgment of the Washington Superior Court (Vermont) which dismissed its suit against appellee Department of Labor and Industry and its Commissioner for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The insurer sought to challenge the issuance of certain interim orders of benefits under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 662(b), and asserted that the statute was constitutionally deficient on its face.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insurer was dissatisfied with the Commissioner's administration of interim payments made pursuant to Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 662(b) after the insurance carrier has denied a claim, but before a hearing on the claim. The insurer claimed the Commissioner's practices violated &sect; 662(b), and its rights to due process and equal protection of the laws. The appellate court held the legislature adopted a broad general standard for issuance of interim orders, that the evidence did not reasonably support the denial. The Commissioner implemented the standard on a case-by-case basis. Thus, each case necessarily involved mixed questions of fact and law. Except in cases of de novo appeals, the courts accorded the Commissioner substantial discretion in rendering a decision. There was no reason to bypass the responsibility and expertise of the Commissioner. Thus, dismissal of the claims against the Commissioner's implementation of &sect; 662(b) was appropriate. However, the insurer could bring a declaratory judgment action to challenge the constitutionality of the statute on its face. Such a challenge was not an appeal requiring certification of questions of fact and law by the Commissioner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's decision dismissing the insurer's complaint was affirmed, except as to allegations challenging the workers' compensation statute on its face.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant town and intervenor property owners appealed a decision from the Franklin Superior Court (Vermont), which ordered the town to allow petitioner landowner to improve part of a roadway and ordered intervenors to remove personal property from part of the roadway. Intervenors also appealed from a denial of their cross-claim alleging adverse possession of certain land and a prescriptive easement over a road.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The selectboard of the town voted to reclassify a portion of the road as a trail. About 25 years later, petitioner asked the selectboard to reconsider the reclassification, order intervenors to remove certain items from the road, and to allow him to make improvements to the road. The selectboard denied all of his requests. The trial court granted relief to petitioner. The court affirmed. The trial court properly voided the reclassification because the description of the road that the selectboard downgraded did not include that portion of the roadway between the land of petitioner and intervenors, and the description of the road proposed to be downgraded was not consistent with the description of the road the selectboard voted to downgrade. Because the discontinuance decision did not, by its terms, cover the section of the road in dispute, petitioner's father, who owned the land when it was downgraded, had not suffered an adverse decision from which he should have appealed; petitioner was thus not barred by the statute of limitations from seeking reconsideration. Intervenors' claims of adverse possession and a prescriptive easement also failed.</SPAN></P>

When the information was not forthcoming, the VDE held a hearing pursuant to &sect; 166b(e). The state supreme court held that the VDE properly determined that the conclusory statement of the professional, by itself, was insufficient &quot;independent professional evidence&quot; of a lack of handicap. Because the statute, and its application, were constructed to clarify the responsibility of the parents and told them exactly what was expected of them, the statute was not fatally vague.</SPAN></P>

After an Appellate Officer reversed the decision to reprimand, the State appealed to the Washington Superior Court which, pursuant to Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 3, &sect; 130a(c), reinstated the reprimand, and the appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The facts did not support a finding that the salesman acted as a real estate broker in a continuous course of conduct without a license. The REC found that the salesman had violated Vt. R. Real Estate Comm'n 2.1(a), (b) under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &sect; 2211, -2212. The group of realtors comprising the REC had no special competence in making the determination of whether the salesman's conduct was a continuing course of conduct under the statute. The court accorded the REC no additional deference to their statutory interpretation. The advertisement in which the salesman was alleged to have held himself out as a broker was not in the record, nor was the number of times the advertisement appeared in Vermont. There was a strong inference that the salesman was showing property. In view of the sparse stipulation, and the fact that it was a case of first impression, the appellate court declined to decide the meaning of a &quot;continuous course of conduct&quot; until it had a more complete factual record. The salesman was not relieved of regulatory requirements by virtue of the fact that only one transaction was involved. The salesman's First Amendment rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent custodial father appealed from an order of the Windham Family Court (Vermont) that granted petitioner maternal grandmother's request for court-ordered visitation pursuant to Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 1011(a), with the child of the father and nominal petitioner mother. He argued that the order violated his right, under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, to raise his child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">From the time the father learned of his paternity, he was active in the raising of his child, whose mother had serious substance abuse problems. Eventually, he obtained custody of the child, who had previously lived with the maternal grandmother. Although there was no evidence that the father had interfered with the grandmother's visitation, except in an effort to limit the child's contact with a sex offender who lived in the grandmother's household, the grandmother sought court-ordered visitation. The high court undertook to interpret the grandparent visitation statute in such a manner as to uphold its constitutionality. The United States Constitution protected a fit parent's due process right of personal choice in child rearing, and overly broad grandparent visitation statutes had been struck down for interfering with that right in the absence of a compelling need in the child's best interests. The high court therefore interpreted the statute as including a presumption in favor of a fit parent's decisions regarding visitation by grandparents, and, since the trial court had not given such regard to the father's decisions, its application of the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The applicant's claim that the regulation violated U.S. Const. amend. I was not reviewed, because the issue was not raised before the trial court. The Vermont Supreme Court found that the regulation exceeded the statutory authority granted under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 304.

The exhaust system of the car sounded louder than that of a modified exhaust system. The trial court found that the trooper was an experienced listener, as he had once owned a vehicle like defendant's and had experience working on car exhaust systems. The trooper thought that the sound was consistent with a perforated muffler. The trooper stopped defendant, because he thought that defendant's vehicle was not in good mechanical condition in violation of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 1221. Defendant was charged with drunk driving. For a car to be in good mechanical condition under &sect; 1221, pursuant to Vt. Stat.

The trooper's observations provided a reasonable basis for believing that defendant's vehicle was not in good mechanical condition. The noise was an adequate basis for the stop.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court held that appellants failed to demonstrate that the termination of the J.L.

The appellate court disagreed, finding that the legislative enactment, codified at Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 7629(d), both expressly and in substance, replaced the J.L. Consent Decree. The Vermont Legislature recorded its specific intention to render the J. L. consent judgment no longer applicable. Appellants did not seek a modification of the consent decree, they sought termination of the consent decree. The motion was not based on a change in factual circumstances, and it was not based on new case law. In the instant case, there could be no weighing of the equities. Once the Legislature asserted its intent to supplant the consent decree, its intent controlled until a proper case or controversy directly addressed the statute. Requiring appellants to demonstrate the constitutionality of the legislation was contrary to the presumption of constitutionality to which the legislation was entitled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The department said Vt. Stat.

Requiring a de novo hearing allowed the Board to compel discovery, and the Board's role was not limited to deciding if the charges against the employee were proven. The employee's collective bargaining agreement's grievance procedure culminated in an appeal to the Board, which had to decide her discrimination and retaliation claims under the agreement, and could order production of evidence to resolve those claims. Holding that internal affairs reports were confidential would be unjust to the employee. She did not show a need for information in the department's command and control sheets. The Board correctly found she was not entitled to discover if another employee was investigated after her dismissal, as that was irrelevant and allowing such discovery was contrary to the purpose of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 20, &sect; 1880 to expeditiously resolve appeals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties entered into a settlement to allow grandparent visitation under New York law. In the motion to end visitation, the mother alleged that the grandparents were interfering with her parental decisions and that they failed to follow notification provisions in the order. In challenging the judgment, the mother argued that Vermont's grandparent visitation statute, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect;&sect; 1011-1016, was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that the mother failed to raise this issue in the family court. The appellate court further found that the mother attacked the Vermont grandparent visitation statute even though the order was issued in New York under a different statutory scheme. The only relevance of the Vermont statute was that the mother invoked it to support a termination of the New York order and now attacked its constitutionality to obtain relief. The appellate court also held that because the New York order resulted from a voluntary stipulation among the parties, and there were no findings initially. The appellate court held that the family court's order attempted to respond to the mother's interests as the family court understood them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee, a not-for-profit corporation, sought a declaratory judgment that it was entitled to a property tax exemption under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect; 3802(4) for a lot and building used for administration and management of its organization and located in appellant town, where the corporation's corporate headquarters was located. The Washington Superior Court (Vermont) entered a declaratory judgment granting the exemption. The town appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation serviced disabled persons in other states, and most of its revenues were generated out of state. Vermont citizens benefited from two of its programs. A requirement for public or charitable exemption under &sect; 3802(4) was that the property's primary use directly benefited an indefinite class of persons who were part of the public and conferred a benefit on society as a result. The appellate court rejected the town's argument that the exemption was only available to not-for-profit corporations that provided direct and immediate benefits to citizens of Vermont and the town. Such a requirement was not in the statute's plain language and would have discriminated against non-Vermont consumers of the corporation's services in violation of Congress' dormant Commerce Clause power. The appellate court also rejected the town's argument that the property did not directly benefit the public, as it was used for administration and management. As the property was used for purposes directly connected with running the corporation, it was tax-exempt, and this was true, even though the property that was used for direct services was located out of state and was subject to taxation.</SPAN></P>

Defendants moved to suppress all evidence obtained pursuant to the search warrant. The reviewing court found that the actions of the town lister did not trigger Fourth Amendment protections. Because the lister, a government official, was not on the property to investigate some breach or wrongdoing, no Fourth Amendment search occurred when the lister encountered the marijuana. The lister had no law enforcement motive and no involvement with law enforcement officials.

The high court agreed that the plain language of the statute extended its protection to all residents, not just legal tenants, and that prior similar treatment of other residents was admissible under Vt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After police arrested defendant for drunk driving, they allowed him a telephone consultation with his lawyer, as provided by Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 1202(c), as he decided whether to submit to a breath test. He ultimately refused, and pled nolo contendere. He argued before entering his conditional plea, however, that police had violated the statute by continuing their security videotaping (with audio) during his telephone conversation. The high court agreed that the videotaping violated the statute, and forbade the practice in future. It also cautioned the State that it had violated evidence and ethical rules by disclosing the content of the consultation in its efforts to defend the practice. All the same, since defendant's consultation had been meaningful and there was no evidence that the videotaping prejudiced his outcome, dismissal of the charges was not warranted. Furthermore, since the illegal videotaping had nothing to do with defendant's refusal to be tested, suppression was likewise inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Vermont's use tax applied to items brought into the state without payment of a sales tax, subject to certain exceptions.  Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect; 9741(15) provided an exemption for newspapers. The taxpayer published a glossy monthly publication, containing primarily advertisements for properties for sale by owner, as well as small amounts of other features. The high court upheld the tax commissioner's determination that this publication was not a newspaper. To avoid focusing on content-based restrictions, the statutory definition purposely focused above all on the physical format and frequency of publication issues, and under this content-neutral definition, which required only rational basis scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause, the taxpayer's publication was plainly not a newspaper. The classification bore a rational basis to the state's interest in encouraging access to newspapers. The taxpayer failed to preserve its freedom of speech and other claims under the Vermont Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers appealed and filed another appeal for the 1994 assessments. The state appraiser held that he lacked authority to rule on the amendment, and applied the rollback penalty for only one year. The state supreme court held that the legislature could not reverse final judicial decisions. The taxpayers had a vested right to the rollback penalty for 1991, 1992, and 1993. However, they were not entitled to the rollback penalty once they elected to go forward on the merits of the 1994 appeal.

The suit claimed that the methods used to determine the equalized education property tax grand lists in the municipalities did not comply with accepted appraisal standards and alleged constitutional and statutory violations. The appellate court held that Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect; 5408 provided for an administrative appeal for redetermination of the equalized education property value. Only after this appeal did the statute authorize an appeal to the superior court. The appellate court held that where a statute created administrative remedies, a party was required to exhaust all such remedies before turning to the courts for relief. Where the legislature specifically mandated, exhaustion was required.  Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect; 5408 required exhaustion of administrative remedies before an appeal to the superior court was allowed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Vermont Department of Corrections' Offender Classification Manual provided that furlough could be granted as part of a reintegration plan during the 90 days prior to a prisoner's release date. The commissioner implemented an amendment providing an exception to the furlough policy for those incarcerated for a violent felony, stating that those incarcerated for a violent felony were not eligible for furlough until their minimum release date. The amendment was issued without notice, comment, and review as was required by the Vermont Administrative Procedures Act (APA), Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 3, &sect; 801 et seq. The trial court found that this violated the APA. The appellate court affirmed. The furlough policy was a rule under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 3, &sect; 801(b)(9), as the rule interpreted the commissioner's power to issue rules necessary for the governing and treatment of persons committed to his custody under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 28, &sect; 102(c)(1). In addition, the rule applied generally to all prisoners convicted of violent felonies, one third of the prison population.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The legislature imposed a five percent tax on expenditures of lobbyists and employers of lobbyists in excess of $ 2,500. Applying strict scrutiny, the superior court ruled the lobby tax violated the First Amendment, and granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs, non-profit organizations employing lobbyists. The State argued on appeal that the superior court erred in (1) subjecting Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 2, &sect; 264a to heightened scrutiny under the First Amendment, (2) holding the statute unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, (3) reaching unbriefed claims under the state constitution, and (4) asserting jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claims without requiring them to first exhaust their administrative remedies. By statutory definition, the lobby tax was a tax imposed directly on expenditures connected with communications and activities aimed at influencing legislation. Because the lobby tax was a distinct, independent tax singling out a discrete group of First Amendment speakers, it was subject to heightened scrutiny. Because the State proffered no government interest apart from the raising of revenue, the tax could not withstand such scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Decedent died intestate, and at the time of his death, no heirs by blood survived. The law in effect at the time prohibited collateral relatives from inheriting from a person who had been adopted. Accordingly, the probate court denied petitioners' claim as adoptive first cousins to decedent's estate. On appeal, petitioners argued the supreme court's prior decision, that Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 448, unconstitutionally denied adopted children the right to inherit from collateral relatives, applied to permit petitioners to inherit from decedent. The supreme court agreed with petitioners and reversed the order. The supreme court noted it held in the prior decision that the rationales proffered to validate Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 448, were not reasonably related to a valid public purpose. Further, the supreme court reasoned that the only difference in the two cases was that petitioners were the collateral relatives of an adopted child, rather than the reverse. Therefore, the supreme court concluded that if it were to hold the statute valid as to petitioners, thereby barring their inheritance, it would have to embrace the underlying premises it had already rejected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court reversed the order and remanded the cause to the probate court to determine the heirs of decedent's estate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant utility's prudence and the usefulness of its decisions were challenged by appellee Vermont public service department in an earlier proceeding before an administrative agency that examined appellant's decision to lock into a purchase contract with a Canadian utility. Appellant was then limited in the amount of added cost it could pass on to customers. When the whole contract issue was raised by appellee in a later rate proceeding, appellant sought to limit damage by arguing that res judicata, collateral estoppel, and equitable estoppel precluded reconsideration. The court held for appellant in finding that collateral estoppel precluded re-examination of the issue of prudence in locking into the contract, because the issues were the same in the first proceeding, were finally determined, and affected any future determination. However, the record was inadequate to determine preclusion on other issues, and prudence of appellant's other decisions regarding the contract could still be litigated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the administrative decision to extent that it failed to give preclusive effect to earlier decision regarding appellant's decision to lock into its outside purchase contract, on grounds of collateral estoppel, but found preclusion theories inapplicable to other issues, on the record available, and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the department had expertise in regulating the business of bail and that its determination was entitled to deference upon review. The department's authority to license appellant and govern his conduct was established by statute. The court overruled appellant's due process claims, as the evidence showed that appellant's conduct was inconsistent with industry standards and that appellant knew he could be held accountable for financial misconduct during and after the negotiation of a bail agreement. Given the egregious nature of appellant's misconduct, his pattern of misconduct, and his continued denial of any wrongdoing, the court held that the revocation of his license and fine of $ 10,000 was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Public Service Board (Board) found that a public utility company's rates were excessive and that it had engaged in a decades-long course of egregious and unprecedented misconduct. The Board determined that, for many years, the public utility company tried to thwart the Board's regulatory oversight by failing to comply with statutory law and regulatory directives, and by showing disdain for accepted principles of utility accounting and management. The Board imposed numerous penalties, including a return-on-equity penalty. The utility company appealed and contended the Board exceeded its authority in imposing that penalty in addition to the statutory fines, that the penalty was unsupported by the evidence and was so excessive that it was unconstitutionally confiscatory. The court held the public utility company made virtually no record to support its argument, other than claiming broadly that the rate-of-return reduction was confiscatory and therefore unconstitutional. The utility company failed to recognize or satisfy its heavy burden of demonstrating the rates imposed by the Board were unjust and unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Decisions of the Public Service Board were affirmed; the court rejected the public utility company's challenges to the Board's significant reduction in the utility company's allowed rate of return on equity because the utility company failed to meet its heavy burden of demonstrating that the Board's rate decision was so plainly unreasonable as to be confiscatory and therefore unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The environmental court struck or amended some of the conditions, but held that the majority of the conditions at issue were not preempted.

The latter conditions did not interfere with railway operations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order from the district court of Vermont from his conviction of domestic assault under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 1042. He sought a new trial on the grounds that: (1) the evidence was insufficient to prove the element of &quot;attempt&quot; beyond a reasonable doubt, and (2) the trial court failed to properly consider his challenge to the prosecutor's pattern of gender-based peremptory jury challenges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Men appeared to be systematically removed from the jury selected by the prosecutor. Because the prosecutor used 85 percent of his strikes against men, taken together with the fact that this was a prosecution for domestic violence, the court concluded defendant established a prima facie case of intentional discrimination. The trial court did not complete the Batson steps, but instead looked at the end product and deemed the jury &quot;reasonably well-balanced.&quot; Then, in the interest of &quot;judicial economy,&quot; the court refused to strike the jury, essentially ruling that whatever discrimination occurred during jury selection was harmless error. This ruling was erroneous. The proper remedy was to require the prosecutor to explain his actions in gender-neutral terms. It was possible for the jury to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant attempted to cause some bodily injury to his estranged wife by intentionally plowing his truck into the shed while she was on the roof, but was unsuccessful because the shed was sturdily built. Such conduct satisfied the requirement that an attempt include an &quot;overt act&quot; in addition to intent to harm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment vacated and remanded for Batson hearing to determine whether there was gender discrimination in jury selection, and if so, to grant a new trial. The evidence was sufficient to support the conviction for domestic assault. Because defendant established a prima facie case, the trial court should have completed the last two steps required under Batson, requiring the prosecutor to offer gender-neutral reasons for his preemptory challenges.</SPAN></P>

In unrelated cases, plaintiff one, prior to final adoption, filed applications seeking variance approval for his project. Plaintiff two, prior to amendments becoming effective, filed applications for his project. The selectboard denied both sets of applications under the old bylaws. On appeal, the environmental court ruled plaintiff one had a right to have his applications considered, because they were filed prior to adoption. However, it denied plaintiff two's appeal, because applications were filed between adoption and before enactment. The court affirmed as to plaintiff one but reversed as to plaintiff two, finding Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 4443(d) was unconstitutional, because it gave selectboards unbridled discretion to decide whether to review applications under the old or new zoning bylaws, with no standards to limit the exercise of that discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment affirmed as to plaintiff one, albeit on different grounds from lower court; judgment vacated as to plaintiff two and cause remand because the statute was unconstitutional, allowing the selectboard unlimited discretion in reviewing variance applications during the interim period prior to enactment of amended zoning laws.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayers sued defendant state tax department seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the income definition and eligibility requirements of the Homestead Property Tax Income Sensitivity Adjustment, Vt. Stat.

On appeal, plaintiffs argued that they had standing to challenge provisions of the statute and that their complaint stated a claim upon which relief could be granted. The appellate court affirmed, concluding that the allegations were sufficient to give plaintiffs standing to attack two aspects of the statutory scheme, but only if they succeeded in showing that both were unconstitutional. Because the court concluded that the $ 75,000 income ceiling in the statute was constitutional, plaintiffs lacked standing.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 5502(a)(3), after being determined guilty of statutory rape because he engaged in a sexual with a person under age 16 in violation of Vt. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3252(a)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was under age 16 and was adjudicated under Vt. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5502(a)(1), (4) to be a delinquent child having committed a delinquent act after being adjudicated guilty of statutory rape because he engaged in a sexual act with a person under age 16 in violation of Vt. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3252(a)(3). A delinquent act was defined by Vt. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5502(a)(3) as an act designated a crime under the laws of the state. The court vacated both family court adjudications. The court interpreted &sect; 3252(a)(3) to not apply where the alleged perpetrator is also a victim under the age of consent, for several reasons. The statute was intended to be a shield for minors, not a sword against them. Mandatory sex act and crime reporting concerned the court. The interpretation would make the section consistent with the child abuse reporting statute and the legislatively-approved family planning services for minors, and to avoid the real possibility of discriminatory enforcement and interference with the privacy rights of defendant and the asserted victim. Narrower construction avoided U.S. Constitutional challenges, and state constitutional and state and federal right to privacy challenges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants in two consolidated cases appealed the suspension of their driver's licenses pursuant to civil suspension proceedings for driving while intoxicated. The court considered whether a trial court in a civil suspension proceeding was permitted to consider the constitutionality of the underlying stop, and, if so, whether the stops in these two cases were lawful. The court held that a defendant in a civil suspension proceeding was entitled to challenge the reasonableness of the underlying stop pursuant to Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 1205(h)(1). The court held that the exclusionary rule extended to civil license suspension proceedings to protect privacy interests and to assure that unlawful police conduct was not encouraged. The statutory requirement that a vehicle have two functioning taillights provided police with a reasonable and articulable basis for stopping a vehicle with only one functioning taillight. Absent evidence that a rear license plate failed to meet the statutory illumination requirements, the State failed to demonstrate a reasonable and articulable basis for stopping a vehicle with only one rear license plate lamp.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed judgment suspending a defendant's driver's license based on evidence of intoxication in a lawful stop for driving a vehicle with only one taillight, but reversed judgment suspending the other defendant's driver's license because the exclusionary rule barred evidence of intoxication in an unlawful stop for driving a vehicle with one rear license plate lamp.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who was charged with grand larceny and assault and robbery with a dangerous weapon, filed motions for home detention under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 7554b and to reduce his $150,000 bail under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 7554. The Superior Court, Orleans Unit, Criminal Division (Vermont) denied his requests. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that while the trial court properly considered the effectiveness of the proposed home detention in securing defendant's appearance and protecting the public, it drew a conclusion about the effectiveness of the home detention program--that the Department of Corrections did not have the ability to supervise individuals released on GPS monitors, and could not detect someone who might be absconding--that was unsupported by any evidence in the record. Thus, remand was required for the trial court to consider the remaining relevant factors with regard to home detention. The trial court did not err, however, in considering acts that occurred when defendant was a minor. Next, the trial court did not err in not reducing the amount of bail. Defendant was facing serious charges involving the use of a dangerous weapon that carried a potential 25-year sentence. Furthermore, he had two failures-to-appear and two violations of probation. Defendant used a Maine address and had allegedly gone to Maine after the charged crimes. These factors supported a substantial monetary bail. The fact that the bail amount was proper likewise addressed defendant's Eighth Amendment claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the denial of defendant's motion for home detention and remanded the issue for reconsideration consistent with its opinion. It affirmed the denial of defendant's motion to reduce bail.</SPAN></P>
