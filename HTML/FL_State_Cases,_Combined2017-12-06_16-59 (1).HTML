<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant car buyer challenged a decision of the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee automobile manufacturer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant car buyer bought a lemon from appellee automobile manufacturer and was entitled to relief under the Lemon Law, the Florida Motor Vehicle Warranty Enforcement Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 681 (1997). The parties disputed the amount of appellant's refund. Appellee successfully argued to the lower court that appellant's refund should have been calculated by using the NADA guide price rather than the trade-in value given by the dealer. Though appellant did not get the same deal from appellee when she returned the lemon that she received from the dealer when she purchased it, appellee did not have an opportunity to object to the dealer's agreement to pay more than the NADA value. The court determined that the Lemon Law was constitutional. The return of the lemon to appellee did not necessarily result in the return of any debt owed on the trade-in vehicle that exceeded the NADA value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment affirmed. The Lemon Law was found to be constitutional. Refund awarded to appellant satisfied the unambiguous definition of purchase price and carried out the legislative intent of the statute. NADA value of trade-in was properly used to determine appellant's refund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayers appealed a final order of the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) dismissing their second amended complaint with prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayers brought an action challenging the Florida homestead tax exemption as set forth in Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6. Plaintiffs contended that the Florida provisions discriminated impermissibly between full-time residents and part-time residents of the State with respect to tax exemptions. Upon review, the court affirmed dismissal of their complaint. The court concluded that trial court had jurisdiction to hear the matter, and that as non-resident taxpayers, plaintiffs had standing to bring a facial constitutional challenge. However, plaintiffs' theories of unconstitutionality lacked legal merit. The Florida homestead tax exemption scheme imposed no meaningful restriction upon the plaintiffs' fundamental right to travel. The Florida homestead tax exemption provisions did not offend equal protection guarantees. Instead, the Florida exemption was an even-handed regulation that promoted the legitimate, strong public interest in promoting the stability and continuity of the primary permanent home. Plaintiffs failed to show that the effects of the exemption upon interstate commerce were anything more than incidental.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment affirmed; the Florida homestead tax exemption scheme imposed no meaningful restriction upon the plaintiffs' fundamental right to travel.

Appellant had standing to challenge his sentence that the court imposed pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (1995) (amended by 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 182). Appellant's sentence under ch. 775.084 was unconstitutional since ch. 182 violated the single subject rule contained in &sect; 6. The court typically compelled remand for resentencing. However, although appellant failed to argue it, case law rendered the crime of firearm possession by a violent career criminal nonexistent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged summary denial, by the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida), of his Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a) motion to correct his sentence, on the grounds that he was sentenced pursuant to unconstitutional legislation, 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 184, and that the date of his criminal offenses fell within the window period where the unconstitutional legislation was applied to sentences for offenses committed within that time frame.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant pled guilty to assault and false imprisonment and another charge was nolle prossed. The written plea form indicated that the trial judge promised to sentence appellant to the low end of the guidelines. Appellant's Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a) motion to correct sentence was denied. The court vacated sentence and remanded. 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 184, under which appellant had been sentenced, was unconstitutional. The trial court erroneously denied relief because it had relied on cases which recognized a window period for ch. 184 challenges that closed October 1996. Although the trial court had not had the benefit of a case that held that the window period closed May 1997, when 1997 Fla. Laws ch. 97 reenacted the amendments contained in ch. 184, appellant's case had been in the pipeline when the case was issued. Though appellant's sentence was part of a plea agreement, and exceeded the 1994 guidelines' permitted range, his remedy was not an automatic resentencing. The State had the option of withdrawing from the plea agreement and taking appellant to trial on all of the original charges, or accepting resentencing under the 1994 guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Sentence was vacated and the cause remanded. Where appellant was sentenced according to a plea agreement but under an unconstitutional guideline that exceeded the range of the guideline in effect before the unconstitutional law, the State had the option of withdrawing from the plea agreement and taking appellant to trial on the original charges, or accepting resentencing under the guideline in effect before the unconstitutional law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was given an enhanced sentence on his conviction for possession and sale of drugs pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 893.13(1)(e) (1997) as the crime occurred within 1,000 feet of a church. Appellant filed an appeal alleging the statute was unconstitutionally vague, it violated his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection, violated the Establishment Clause, and interfered with freedom of religion. Finding the statute constitutional and affirming, the court held &sect; 893.13(1)(e) which did not purport to regulate constitutionally protected conduct could be struck down as being unconstitutionally vague only if the statutory language was so vague that it failed to give adequate notice of any conduct that the statute proscribed. The statute prohibited illegal drug activity in the area of a church; it did not purport to regulate constitutionally protected conduct, appellant's conduct was within the prohibitions of the statute. Further, religious freedom was not impacted as the statute only impinged on the act of selling drugs in proximity to a church, which was not constitutionally protected conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Enhanced sentencing statute constitutional and conviction affirmed; statute was not unconstitutional based on vagueness as it did not regulate a constitutionally protected conduct and it gave notice of the proscribed conduct. Only the selling of drugs in proximity to a church was impacted not religious freedom.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, challenged the order of the Circuit Court for Walton County (Florida) in an inverse condemnation action determining that appellant department's denial of a dredge and fill permit constituted an unconstitutional taking of appellee's land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee was denied an application for a dredge and fill permit to construct on his wetland property a wooden dock, boardwalk, and A-framed camping shelter. He did not appeal that decision. Instead, he filed an inverse condemnation claim in which he alleged that the permit denial resulted in an unconstitutional taking of his property because he had been denied all &quot;economical, viable, or reasonable use&quot; of the property. The trial court granted his inverse condemnation claim. The court held that appellee utterly failed to demonstrate that the permit denial deprived him of all reasonable economic use of his land. Appellee, as a landowner, did not have a right to gain a profit from an investment in land, and the frustration of speculative economic gain was not protected by the Takings Clause. Because appellee's use of his land for personal recreational purposes was not even substantially thwarted, his claim for inverse condemnation was improper. Therefore, the court reversed the trial court's order finding that appellant's denial of a dredge and fill permit resulted in a total taking of appellee's wetlands requiring compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment reversed; denial of the dredge and fill permit for appellee's property was not a total denial of all &quot;economical, viable, or reasonable use&quot; of the property that required compensation because appellee's proposed economic gain from use of the land was only speculative and his use of the land for personal recreational purposes was not substantially thwarted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Appellant's window period was October 1, 1995 to May 24, 1997, for both laws. He committed the crimes for which he was sentenced in November 1995, thus targeting the window period. However, appellant was unable to show that his sentences would have been different had the earlier version of the statutes been in effect. The scoresheet showed the trial judge departed from the guidelines under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 921.001, and imposed a sentence, pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 775.087(1) (1995), which provided for reclassifications of felonies when a firearm was used, and thus, the imposition of a longer sentence. That part of the 1995 statute was the same as the 1993 statute. Thus, appellant was entitled to no relief; judgment affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees sued in their residential county seeking a declaratory judgment that a law authorizing certain specialty license plates was unconstitutional. Appellant moved to transfer venue to the county where its headquarters were located, supporting it with appropriate affidavits. Appellees argued, among other things, that the &quot;sword wielder&quot; exception applied. The court reversed and remanded, finding appellees failed to prove any exception to or waiver from the common law rule requiring that civil actions brought against state agencies were proper in the county where the agency maintained its headquarters. The sword wielder exception would not apply to excuse compliance with the home venue rule, and where a state agency's actions were statewide, in the absence of showing of particularized harm to plaintiffs that would occur within the county, separate and apart from the generalized harm suffered by all citizens by the enforcement of an allegedly unconstitutional law, the home venue privilege applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged a sentence imposed after a trial court determined he violated parole by being absent from his approved residence, resisting an officer without violence, and obstructing justice.

The court agreed and reversed the sentence because the underlying offense occurred during the window period set by the state's highest court for challenging sentences imposed pursuant to the unconstitutional guidelines.

First, the court found appellant was entitled to correction of a scrivener's error on his scoresheet, but that the trial court had correctly annotated the correct points thereon.

Stat. ch. 775.082(8) (1997), was unconstitutional on several grounds. First, he contended the Act violated his due process rights because he was not given notice the Act would apply to him when he was released from prison. The court found appellant was not given notice because the Act had not yet become law when he was released from prison. Appellant also claimed the Act violated the equal protection clause because it created two irrational classifications, one class containing prisoners released prior to the Act's effective date who could not have received notice of the Act's application and another class containing those prisoners released after the Act's effective date who did receive such notice. The court was unconvinced the Act created two impermissible classes of convicted felons, as every prison releasee who committed a crime after the effective date of the Act was potentially subject to an enhanced penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment affirmed; court rejected appellant's due process and equal protection clause arguments to validity of reoffender statute, as due process did not require the State to give appellant notice of statute's application at time he was released from prison and statute did not create two impermissible classes of convicted felons.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals affirmed defendant's conviction of burglary, reversed his conviction for robbery, and reduced the robbery conviction to one for petit theft, and remanded for resentencing. The court rejected defendant's argument that as to the burglary conviction the premises involved were open to the public. The evidence established that even though the McDonald's drive-thru was open for business, the area designated to handle that business was not open to public access. The court agreed with defendant that as to the robbery the testimony did not establish that the circumstances surrounding the &quot;robbery&quot; were such that ordinarily would induce the fear of death or great bodily harm in the mind of a reasonable person. There was no testimony that there was an actual touching of her person or that any physical force was exercised by defendant against her. The court concluded that no evidence was presented from which the jury could find the requisite fear or force necessary to establish a robbery. The court noted that defendant's sentence was based upon a law that was unconstitutional as of the date his offense took place.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his sentence from the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida), asserting that the 1995 sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional because the legislature's enactment of 1995 Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his sentence on the ground that the 1995 sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional because 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 184, violated the single-subject provision of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6. The court found that with the Heggs standard, the Florida Supreme Court found the 1995 sentencing guidelines were unconstitutionally enacted. The date of the offense, not the date of the sentencing hearing, determined standing to challenge the constitutionality. Only defendants serving sentences imposed under the 1995 guidelines whose sentences would have constituted a departure sentence under the 1994 guidelines stood to benefit. Based upon the date of his offense, defendant had standing to challenge his sentence if May 24, 1997 constituted the proper date on which the window closed. The court declined to calculate a new scoresheet based upon the 1994 guidelines, and remanded to the circuit court for the determination. If the 104.4 months sentence fell within the range permitted by the 1994 sentencing guidelines, resentencing would be unnecessary. If it exceeded the permissible 1994 guideline range, defendant was entitled to resentencing.</SPAN></P>

Appellants argued that the trial court's decision resulted in an unconstitutional application of Fla. Stat. ch. 193.011 (1997). In looking at the plain language of the statute, the court found that the property appraiser was not required to make a deduction for costs of sale when determining fair market value. Next, the court found that the trial court erred in finding &quot;reasonable fees and costs of purchase&quot; in subsection (1) to be the same as &quot;reasonable fees and costs of the sale&quot; in subsection (8).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was sentenced according to Florida's 1995 sentencing guidelines. These guidelines, which were adopted by 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 95-184, were declared unconstitutional as violative of the single-subject provision of Fla. Const. art III, &sect; 6. The court held that, because appellant claimed to have been sentenced pursuant to the 1995 sentencing guidelines (requiring a longer sentence than the previous version), his claim was colorable if his crimes were committed within the window for such claims. The court held that the opening date for single subject challenges to the 1995 sentencing guidelines was October 1, 1995, the effective date of 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 95-184. The closing date was no later than May 24, 1997, the effective date of the reenacting legislation. The court rejected the State's request for an earlier closing date, because 1996 Fla.

The court however modified the sentence to delete the phrase &quot;as a violent career criminal.&quot; Because defendant was subject to sentencing as a prison releasee reoffender, he was not subject to sentencing as a violent career criminal because Fla.

Under that decision, appellants who committed their crimes within the applicable window period and were sentenced pursuant to &sect; 775.084(1)(c) were required to be resentenced under the valid laws in effect when they committed their crimes. The court held that the window period for challenges to the constitutionality of the statute extended from October 1, 1995, to May 24, 1997.

The trial court certified questions concerning whether either suspension of a driver's license or temporary detention of DUI arrestees barred subsequent DUI prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees were arrested for violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193 (1997).

After arrest each appellee was detained in jail for eight hours or more. The appellate court found that the trial court erred in dismissing the DUI charges. The driver's license suspensions were civil in character and did not implicate double jeopardy. Also, Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193(9) (1997) was not unconstitutional in allowing temporary detention of an apparently drunk driver, nor did such detention give rise to any viable claim of double jeopardy by the detainee at any subsequent criminal trial. The practice was intended to protect the driver and the community from the unreasonable danger posed by drunken driving.</SPAN></P>

Appellee contended that the general power provision to amend the declaration provided sufficient notice for the subsequent addition of the common area alteration amendment and that the amendment was retroactive to the date of the declaration. Appellee argued that the amendment to Fla. Stat. ch. 718.110(4) granted power to homeowners' associations to alter common areas. The court held that, at the time the condominium was put on the market, &sect; 718.110(4) required that any amendment which altered the appurtenances to a unit had to be approved by all of the unit owners unless it was provided otherwise in the declaration as originally recorded.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner sought habeas relief from the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida), arguing he was denied effective assistance of appellate counsel because counsel failed to raise the issue that petitioner was sentenced under a provision, Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(1)(c) (1995) (enacted as 95 Fla. Laws ch. 182), subsequently held unconstitutional. The appellate court treated the petition as one filed pursuant to Fla. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After being convicted of attempted murder of a law enforcement officer and two firearms violations, petitioner was sentenced to natural life in prison as a violent career criminal, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(1)(c) (1995) (enacted as 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 182). Before petitioner's direct appeal was heard, the Florida Supreme Court held that 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 182 was unconstitutional. Appellate counsel failed to use that decision to challenge petitioner's sentence. Petitioner subsequently filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that appellate counsel's failure to raise the issue constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. The court treated the petition as one filed pursuant to Fla. R. App. P. 9.140(j) and granted relief. The State conceded that the date of petitioner's offense fell within the window established by the supreme court for challenging a sentence under that court's Thompson decision. Therefore, had the issue been raised on direct appeal, the matter would have been remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: testimony that appellant gave a false name to police had been properly admitted as evidence of flight; cross-examination by the prosecution regarding appellant's prior convictions was proper, as appellant had voluntarily taken the stand and attempted to minimize the extent and seriousness of his priors; and unsolicited testimony of appellant's having been in jail was not prejudicial, as the jury heard testimony regarding appellant's 14 prior convictions. Finally, in response to a recent decision of the Florida Supreme Court declaring unconstitutional the Gort Career Criminal Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 95-182, under which appellant had been sentenced, the court reversed the sentences and remanded the case for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 775.21(4)(c) required the lower court to make a finding of sexual predator status in the instant case because respondent was convicted of committing a first degree felony violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 794 and the offense was committed on or after October 1, 1996. Accordingly, the court granted the petition, and reversed and remanded the order denying the state's motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court determined that the challenged rules regarding Medicaid funding for medically necessary abortions did not violate the right to privacy guaranteed by Fla.

Appellants contended that when the state chose to fund medically necessary health care for its citizens, the Florida Constitution required it to do so in a neutral manner with respect to the exercise of fundamental rights. The existence of a constitutional right to engage in certain conduct did not carry an entitlement to sufficient state funds to enable one to exercise that right.

Stat. ch. 827.03(3)(c) (1997).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with the crime of child neglect, Fla. Stat. ch. 827.03(3)(c) (1997), after investigators found nine-year-old daughter living in a filthy trailer. In holding that the State had failed to prove prima facie violation of statute, the court noted that it had taken several versions of child neglect statute to articulate one that passed constitutional muster by requiring culpable level of negligence (consciously doing act that reasonable person would know was likely to result in death or great bodily harm, with utter disregard) or willfulness (acting voluntarily and consciously) in the parent, as well as placement of child at risk of serious physical or mental injury. In this case, State failed to show any real risk to child (due in part to age), and it also failed to show defendant's culpability. This was a case for State to act in other ways, to help parents better meet responsibilities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded with instructions to grant motion for acquittal, because State had not proved prima facie violation of statute; it had not shown that child was at risk of injury, nor had it shown culpable knowledge on defendant's part.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants convicted under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 893.13(1)(e) appealed from the Circuit Court for Sumter County (Florida) challenging the constitutionality of the statute, arguing it was unduly vague and that it violated the establishment clause U.S. Const. amend. I and Fla. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The statute provided enhanced penalties for drug offenses committed in proximity to places of worship, among other places. Defendants argued that the statute violated the federal establishment clause of U.S. Const. amend. I and Fla. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3. The court denied that challenge, holding a court could invalidate a statute only if the statute was motivated wholly by an impermissible purpose, if it advanced religion or required excessive entanglement. The legislature furthered the state's legitimate purpose of protecting its law abiding citizens. Defendants next argued the statute was unconstitutionally void for vagueness, and that it violated both the due process and equal protection clauses of the U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV. Because the statute governed drug prosecutions, not protected activity, it could be struck down only if the statutory language is so vague that it failed to give adequate notice of any conduct that the statute proscribed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment and sentences affirmed because the enhancement provision contained in the statute bears some rational relationship to the state's legitimate purpose of protecting its law abiding citizens from encountering drug crimes in areas where such citizens tend to congregate, and the statutory language was not vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant raised two arguments on appeal: the prosecutor made improper closing arguments, and the trial court erred when it sentenced him pursuant to the Prison Releasee Reoffender Act, Fla.

Only one objection was made, and that was to the prosecutor's accurate quotation of a standard jury instruction. Defendant did not preserve any other of the prosecutor's comments for appellate review. Even if some of the comments were improper, they did not constitute fundamental error. As to the second issue, the court had previously determined that chapter 775.082(9) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The judge properly awarded appellee treatment for his neck and back injuries because appellee's doctor testified that the injuries were related to his accident, and that appellee's prior lumbar strain had been resolved when the accident occurred. The judge did not err in admitting a letter summarizing a meeting between appellee's physician and appellants held pursuant to Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged appellee Department of Business &amp; Professional Regulation, Division of Alcoholic Beverages &amp; Tobacco's Declaratory Statement, asserting that the regulatory statutes interpreted by the Department, Fla. Stat. chs. 561.411, 564.02(3)(a), 565.03(2) (1997), setting minimum inventory, warehouse space, and licensing requirements for wine distributors, and arguably placed greater profit-margin burdens on small, independent distributors than on larger distributors, were unconstitutional on substantive due process and equal protection grounds. The court held that administrative agencies were not a proper forum to raise constitutional issues, and that it had the power to consider constitutional issues on appeal from an administrative agency where the record was sufficiently developed. The record herein was not sufficiently developed to allow determination of the issues, and the court affirmed without prejudice to appellant's right to bring a declaratory judgment action in the circuit court to develop a complete record for review of the constitutional issues raised.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the declaratory statement without prejudice to appellant's right to bring a declaratory judgment action to develop a complete record for review of the constitutional issues raised in its appeal.</SPAN></P>

The petition filed by petitioner was denied. The circuit court's determination that the mandatory arbitration provision was constitutional constituted a departure from the essential requirements of law and resulted in a miscarriage of justice.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the circuit court for Escambia County (Florida) convicting her of aggravated child abuse, following a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was charged with aggravated child abuse in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 827.03(2)(b). At trial, over appellant's objections, the standard jury instruction, which included a malice definition at odds with the definition in prior supreme court decisions, was given. Appellant moved for a new trial, arguing that the trial court had incorrectly instructed the jury. The motion was denied, and appellant was convicted. On appeal the court held the trial court erred in giving the jury the definition in the standard instruction, rather than that adopted in other case law. The instruction given permitted the jury to return a guilty verdict based upon a finding of only legal, or technical, malice, rather than actual malice, or malice in fact. Because the jury might well have concluded from the evidence that appellant had not acted &quot;maliciously&quot; had it been properly charged, the error was harmful. The court reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, after release from prison, committed two batteries on a police officer on the effective date of a sentence enhancement statute, the Prison Releasee Reoffender Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082(8) (1997). The prosecution requested an enhanced sentence upon conviction. The court imposed the statutory sentence on each count, but had them run concurrently. Defendant challenged the statute as unconstitutional. The court found that all the challenges had already been disposed of in previous cases, except a separation of powers challenge, which had already been certified to the Florida Supreme Court, and which the court recertified. The State appealed imposition of concurrent sentences, based on expressed legislative intent to impose severe sentences, but the court refused to infer an intent to limit a court's discretion to impose concurrent or consecutive sentences in the absence of an express statutory direction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed, finding no constitutional deficiency, but certified a question about separation of powers issue to the Florida Supreme Court; it also affirmed concurrent sentences because the sentence enhancement statute did not address the issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants appealed order of Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) which granted summary judgment to plaintiff city and ordered judicial sale of defendants' property to satisfy plaintiff's administrative lien, where defendants alleged that plaintiff failed to comply with notice provisions of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 162.12 (1997).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff city brought an action to foreclose an administrative lien imposed upon defendants' property, based on the neglected condition of the property, where defendants' notice of the lien hearing, as required by Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 162.12 (1997),was sent to the incorrect post office box number. The court held that, in view of the fact that prior notices of violation to defendants had been returned and plaintiff's subsequent receipt of the correct box number, it was reasonable to use the corrected box number to advise defendants of the potential and significant deprivation of their property. Notice sent to the correct current residence address would also have been sufficient to satisfy the statute, even if the notice were returned unclaimed. Plaintiff's failure to pursue either reasonable course of action, however, constituted a taking of defendants' property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Order was reversed; plaintiff city's mailing of notice of lien hearing to defendants' post office box address known to be incorrect, rather than to defendants' corrected box address or current residence address, rendered plaintiff's imposition of the administrative lien an unconstitutional taking of defendants' property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant filed an appeal from the appellee Florida Department of Health, State Board of Psychology, which imposed sanctions upon him for alleged &quot;sexual misconduct&quot; in the practice of psychology, under Fla. Stat. ch. 490.0111.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, a psychologist, saw complainant on several occasions to perform a child custody assessment. After a year elapsed with no contact between them, appellant and complainant began a romantic relationship that lasted over six years. After the relationship ended, complainant filed a complaint with appellee, which instituted proceedings against appellant for &quot;sexual misconduct.&quot; Appellant admitted to the relationship, and appellee suspended his license for one year, with another year of probation, plus a fine. On appeal, the appellant challenged Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 69B19-16.003(5)(a), which deemed the psychologist-client relationship to continue in perpetuity. The court struck the rule as unconstitutional and reversed appellee's order. Although the rule banning sexual conduct between a psychologist and a former client served a compelling state interest, the perpetuity clause failed the least-intrusive means test, was on its face over-broad, and therefore violated Fla. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Order reversed and remanded with directions to rescind all sanctions imposed upon appellant. Although the rule banning sexual conduct between a psychologist and a former client served a compelling state interest, the perpetuity clause violated the state constitutional right to privacy, therefore the court struck that subsection from the rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Baker County (Florida), which denied his motion to dismiss the information charging him with a violation of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant moved on constitutional grounds to dismiss the information. The trial court denied the motion, appellant entered into a plea agreement, and the trial court noted that he reserved the right to appeal. However, the trial court did not explicitly rule that appellant's motion was dispositive, and the State did not stipulate that it was dispositive. On appeal, the State contended that the court lacked jurisdiction to consider the denial of appellant's motion. The appellate court disagreed. An Ashby nolo plea is permissible only when the legal issue to be determined on appeal is dispositive. A ruling is &quot;dispositive&quot; if, at the time of the plea, the State clearly cannot or will not proceed with prosecution if the ruling is reversed. Here, no stipulation was necessary because reversal of the trial court's ruling would make it legally impossible for the State to proceed with the prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, who provided escort services, became involved in credit card factoring for a factoring merchant, which was actually a police department reverse sting operation. They were convicted of and sentenced for violation of Fla. Stat. &sect; 817.62(3)(b) (1995). The court reversed the convictions and sentences, finding that factoring was a legitimate enterprise when the acquirer, a bank, authorized the factoring merchant to factor credit card slips from escort services and those escort services were legal. The reversed sting operation failed because the necessary element of &quot;without authorization&quot; of the acquirer was absent.</SPAN></P>

Issuing a writ of certiorari, the court struck down the portion of the ordinance dealing with amplified sound. The court found that the ordinance was flawed not simply because it sanctioned some constitutionally protected conduct, but because it was founded upon the mistaken premise that all amplified sound in nonenclosed structures was unreasonable during certain hours of the day and could be prohibited regardless of the First Amendment rights it suppressed.</SPAN></P>

The court denied petitioner's writ for certiorari, and agreed with the trial court that the statute was constitutional. The trial court was correct in determining that it had no authority to issue the stay, because ch. 322.28(5) was a valid general rule, and therefore prevailed over Fla. R.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">By petition for writ of certiorari, petitioner attorney sought review of an order requiring respondent city to pay $ 40/hour legal fees plus costs for petitioner's representation of defendant in his successful appeal to the Florida Supreme Court of his conviction for first degree murder and his sentence of death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. A judge prevailed upon petitioner to accept representation of defendant on appeal; the conviction was eventually reversed. Petitioner moved for payment of appellate attorney's fees and costs, seeking $ 91,390.00 in fees at the rate of $ 140 per hour. The trial court ruled that the time for attorneys, paralegals and law clerks would be compensated at the hourly rate of $ 40 under Fla. Fourth Jud. Cir. Admin. Order No. 86-33. While pending, that order was amended, increasing the allowable hourly rate from $ 40 to $ 50 an hour. The court agreed that since the amendment occurred during the pendency of the matter, petitioner would receive benefit of the increased hourly rate; otherwise, relief was denied; the question of the hourly compensate rate of $ 50 per hour being &quot;confiscatory&quot; was certified to the Florida Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) convicting and sentencing her for battery on a law enforcement officer and determining that she was a prison releasee reoffender pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082(9)(a)1 (Supp. 1998).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was correct that the State did not present any documentation supporting its allegation that she was released from prison in March 1996. Defense counsel specifically argued that no proof was shown that appellant was released from prison within three years of commission of the new crime and that appellant did not agree that she qualified as a prison releasee reoffender. Additionally, no such documentation appeared in the record on appeal. Because the State did not properly demonstrate that appellant was released from a state correctional facility within three years of the commission of her new offense of battery on a law enforcement officer and therefore qualified as a prison releasee reoffender, the court reversed and remanded appellant's sentence. On remand, the trial court could again impose the prison releasee reoffender sentence if the State provided the proper documentation to demonstrate that appellant qualified as a prison releasee reoffender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment affirmed in part; conviction was affirmed. Judgment reversed and remanded in part; appellant's sentence as prison releasee reoffender was improper because the State did not show that appellant was released from prison within three years of the commission of her new offense of battery on a law enforcement officer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged a judgment, based upon a jury verdict, of the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida) convicting him of, inter alia, a felony causing bodily injury, attempted second degree murder with a deadly weapon, and armed burglary of a structure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of felonies involving his brutal attack and robbery of a woman at her place of employment. The jury rejected appellant's argument that he lacked the requisite criminal intent due to his insanity. On appeal, appellant argued his conviction for armed burglary of a structure was improper because the warehouse where he attacked his victim was open to the public. The court found the warehouse was in fact not open to the public but, rather, only open to the business's employees. Appellant's also argued his convictions for both a felony causing bodily injury and attempted second degree murder violated the double jeopardy clause of U.S. Const. amend. V. The court disagreed, holding the two offenses did not require identical elements of proof; the offenses were not degrees of the same offense; and one offense was not a lesser included offense of the other. Separate sentencing was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment affirmed; armed burglary conviction was proper because warehouse where crime was committed was clearly a structure not open to public. Convictions for felony causing bodily injury and attempted second degree murder did not violate appellant's right against double jeopardy as each offense contained elements not found in the other.</SPAN></P>

He was then found to be both a prison releasee reoffender and a habitual offender for those and other crimes. On appeal, the court reversed in part. Appellant contended, and the state agreed, that two of his convictions were for burglaries of unoccupied structures and he received prison releasee reoffender sentences for those convictions. The crime of burglary of an unoccupied structure was not subject to the prison releasee reoffender sanction, as Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082(9)(a)1 only listed burglary of an occupied structure as a qualifying crime. Second, appellant's written sentence of 15 years was ordered to be corrected, to conform with the trial court's oral sentence of 10 years as a habitual offender. However, the court affirmed that appellant could be constitutionally sentenced under both the prison releasee reoffender sentences and habitual felony sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Reversed in part, because the crime of burglary of an unoccupied structure was not subject to the prison releasee reoffender sanction; affirmed where appellant was constitutionally sentenced under both the prison releasee reoffender sentences and habitual felony sentences.</SPAN></P>

Defendant pulled into the driveway of a premises described in a search warrant during the search. The court found no difference in defendant and his vehicle being on the premises when the deputies arrived as opposed to his driving onto the premises after the arrival of the officers. The court recognized that the search of defendant's person may not have been justified under the terms of the warrant since officers had no sound reason to believe he was connected to the illegal activity. However, either way, it was certain that the search of his person was inevitable if the search of his vehicle was lawful. Once the deputies searched the vehicle and found the cannabis, they were authorized to search defendant's person pursuant to the &quot;search incident to arrest&quot; exception.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment was affirmed because the search of defendant's car was lawful because it was driven into the area described in the search warrant, and search of defendant's person fell under the inevitable discovery exception, because he would have been searched incident to arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was sentenced pursuant to Fla. Stat.

The court determined that the Act does not violate the single subject requirement of the Florida Constitution, does not violate the separation of powers doctrine, does not violate the cruel and unusual punishment prohibition, was not subject to a double jeopardy challenge by appellant, is not unconstitutionally vague, does not violate equal protection principles, and does not violate ex post facto principles.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant contended that the fighting rule, Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 33-601.314, &sect;2-4, was unauthorized and unconstitutional because it made even self-defense a violation of the rule. Appellant had been involved in a fight with his cellmate. The record contained evidence supporting the disciplinary team's finding that appellant was in a fight, but the trial court erred in dismissing the portion of the petition attacking the validity of the fighting rule without affording appellant an opportunity to prove his standing to raise the question. If successful on standing, appellant could obtain a declaratory judgment. The claim was cognizable in an action for declaratory relief as appellant was disciplined on the basis of the fighting rule and could face enhanced punishment in future disciplinary proceedings.</SPAN></P>

On certiorari, the court first ruled that the legislature had authority to amend Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27.53(3) to permit inquiry into alleged conflicts of interest. The court agreed with the public defender that the prior representation of one of the witnesses in the present case, through the conclusion of felony charges and violations of community control, was substantial enough to establish a conflict of interest. Since the trial court should have granted the motion to withdraw, the court quashed the trial court's order denying the motion to withdraw.</SPAN></P>

During the appellee's case, two police officers testified that appellant told them that he did not rob the victim, but that he had been the lookout during the robbery. Appellant admitted on direct examination that he had ten felony convictions. The trial court refused to allow appellant to tell the jury that he had pleaded guilty in his prior cases. On appeal, the court held that because appellant's credibility was a feature of the trial, he should have been allowed to testify to his prior pleas. The court also held that the trial court erred in allowing the appellee to question appellant concerning whether the police witnesses were lying, because questions directed to one witness concerning whether another witness lied on the stand were improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant contended that his sentences imposed pursuant to the Prison Releasee Reoffender Act (Act), Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082(8) (1997) needed to be reversed because the Act was unconstitutional. The Act had been found constitutional in previous challenges. Appellant argued that resisting arrest with violence was not a qualifying offense under the Act. The court found that since resisting arrest with violence was a felony that involved the use or threat of physical force or violence, the offense was a qualifying offense under the Act and appellant's prison releasee reoffender sentence for that offense was proper. However, appellant's sentences for possession of cocaine and grand theft were not qualifying offenses under the Act and were reversed. Appellant's prior convictions were not qualifying convictions for violent career criminal sentencing pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(5) (1997). Appellant's sentencing scoresheet had to be calculated without applying the law enforcement multiplier.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed and remanded for resentencing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant argued that the Prison Releasee Reoffender Punishment Act (Act), Fla.

He further argued that his convictions for battery on a law enforcement officer and resisting an officer with violence violated double jeopardy prohibitions. The court concluded that the Act did not violate the separation of powers clause or the single subject requirement. The Florida Supreme Court determined that dual convictions of battery on a law enforcement officer and resisting an officer with violence did not violate double jeopardy principles. Therefore, the court affirmed appellant's convictions but, certified the following question as one of great public importance: Does the Prison Releasee Reoffender Punishment Act, codified as Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082(8) (1997), violate the separation of powers clause of the Florida Constitution?</SPAN></P>

The grandparents, having previously been permitted to intervene in the case, filed a petition seeking custody of the child. The trial court, following a hearing, denied appellant's motion for change of custody, and granting the grandparent's petition for custody. The trial court relied on Fla. Stat. ch. 61.13(7) (1997), finding that it would be in the best interest of the child to remain with her grandparents with whom she had resided almost continuously for seven years. The trial court found that the grandparents had the same standing as the parents for purposes of evaluating primary residence arrangements. On appeal, the court found that the trial court relied on statutory authority which had been found to be unconstitutional. Thus, the court was compelled to reverse the order of the trial court and remand for further consideration of the issues.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 775.082 (1997).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment on his burglary conviction due to his designation as a prison releasee reoffender (PRR), and two 25-year sentences for dealing in stolen property due to his designation as a habitual felony offender (HFO). On appeal, the court affirmed. Designation of appellant as a PRR and an HFO pursuant to the Prison Releasee Reoffender Punishment Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082 (1997), did not violate the Florida Constitution's Separation of Powers Clause and the single subject requirement, did not violate due process and equal protection, and was not cruel and unusual punishment. Nor was ch. 775.082 void for vagueness, and appellant's sentence did not violate double jeopardy principles. The court, however, certified a question as to whether Fla.
