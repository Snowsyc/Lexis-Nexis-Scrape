The patient alleged that the doctor's negligence during the first surgery was a proximate cause of the cardiac arrest. The appellate court held that the trial justice did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on the affirmative defense of intervening and superseding cause of another doctor because, since both doctors were operating as part of a surgical team, their roles and responsibilities were inextricably intertwined. Further, the trial justice's reference to insurance by expressly telling the jurors to completely ignore any assumptions or implications concerning insurance coverage was proper under R.I. R. Evid. 411 because the justice was not oblivious to the fact that the overall concept of liability insurance may have pervaded the minds of the jurors in the medical malpractice case. Finally, the court held that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 9-21-10(b), which mandated 12 percent prejudgment interest in medical malpractice cases, was not unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Rhode Island Department of Corrections (DOC) filed a petition seeking to vacate, or, in the alternative, to modify, an arbitration award for a union in dispute over weapons training for correctional officers (COs) under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 28-9-18(a) and 28-9-20 (1956). DOC appealed the grant by the Providence County Superior Court, Rhode Island, of the union's motion to confirm the award under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 28-9-17 (1956).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court held that DOC's proposal to abandon yearly on-range weapons qualification after R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-47-17 (1956) was amended was based on budgetary concerns. DOC claimed that under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-56-10(14) (1956), its director had the authority and duty to establish training programs for COs. However, that duty and authority was not exclusive. The union was entitled under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 28-9-1 (1956) to negotiate over matters that directly affected its members' work and welfare, and &sect; 42-56-10(14) did not prevent the DOC director from exercising his power in consultation with the union. The dispute was arbitrable. The arbitrator's reading of &sect; 11-47-17 as meaning that COs had to undergo weapons qualification at least every two years, and prescribing a maximum time period, rather than a minimum or fixed time period, within which COs had to complete weapons qualification was passably plausible. DOC could not modify the weapons qualification component of the training program without the training committee's approval. DOC was not statutorily precluded from fulfilling its contractual obligation to conduct annual weapons qualification.</SPAN></P>

Hawkins and Thomas C. Slater Medical Marijuana Act (Act), R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 21, ch. 28.6 (1956), by the Providence County Superior Court, Rhode Island, of charges against defendants of possessing marijuana with the intent to deliver it, manufacturing marijuana and committing a crime of violence while having available a firearm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court vacated the dismissal. The parties disagreed as to whether the amount of marijuana found in defendants' possession exceeded the amount permitted under the Act. Section 21-28.6-8 clearly stated that charges brought in a prosecution involving marijuana were to be dismissed following an evidentiary hearing where the defendant showed the elements listed in &sect; 21-28.6-8(a). The burden was on defendants to request an evidentiary hearing to show that they had satisfied the elements listed in &sect; 21-28.6-8(a) and were in possession of an amount of medical marijuana that conformed to the limits set forth in the Act. Although the trial court held a hearing on the defendants' motion to dismiss, the parties presented no evidence at that hearing, including evidence regarding defendant one's role as a primary caregiver. Since no evidentiary hearing was held, in contravention of the plain terms of the Act, the dismissal was premature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was vacated. The case was remanded to the trial court with instructions to conduct an evidentiary hearing pursuant to &sect; 21-28.6-8(b).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimant filed a petition seeking a continuation of workers' compensation benefits from defendant employer. The Appellate Division of the Rhode Island Workers' Compensation Court denied plaintiff partial incapacity benefits beyond the 312-week period provided by R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 28-33-18.3 (1956). Plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, which was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff began receiving disability benefits for a work-related back injury. Over six years after the injury, he filed the instant petition, claiming he continued to be entitled to partial incapacity benefits because, although able to work with limitations, he could not regain his pre-injury earning capacity. The high court disagreed. Under &sect; 28-33-18.3(a)(1), the inability to regain one's earning capacity was not a &quot;material hindrance to obtaining employment suitable to his or her limitations&quot; required in order for benefits to continue. Instead, &sect; 28-33-18.3(a)(1) required that the partial disability itself serve as the &quot;material hindrance.&quot; As plaintiff was employed in a position that accommodated his limitations, he did not meet his burden of proving that his incapacity posed a material hindrance to obtaining employment. Section &sect; 28-33-18(d) did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of  R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, as plaintiff claimed, because it did not infringe upon a fundamental right nor create a suspect class, and the legislature could have had a rational basis for limiting the potentially infinite and burdensome duration of partial incapacity benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 12-19-19(c) purported to exonerate any person who successfully complied with the terms and conditions of a written deferral agreement for the charges for which sentence was deferred. The court determined that &sect; 12-19-19 did not apply retroactively to appellants' deferred sentences because the amending act contained no express language for retroactive application and in fact provided that it was effective upon passage. The amendments created new substantive rights because, under prior law, the sealing of records was not available to individuals who had committed a crime of violence or who were not first-time offenders. Under the former expungement regime, a person whose conviction had been expunged was not required to disclose his or her conviction except in certain circumstances listed in R.I. Gen. Laws. &sect; 12-1.3-4(a)-(b). Section 12-19-19(c) contained no such limitation as to disclosure. Because the amendments created substantive rights, they were not entitled to retroactive application.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2003, appellant pleaded nolo contendre to obtaining money under false pretenses over $ 500 in the Providence County Superior Court (Rhode Island).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 12-19-19(c), as amended in 2010, governing exoneration and sealing in cases of successful deferred sentences, indicated that it did not apply retroactively because the plain language of the statute did not indicate that it was to apply retroactively, and the act provided that it was effective upon passage. The statute indicated that it applied to &quot;written deferral agreements,&quot; which was a change from the prior statute, which referred only to written agreements; the fact that exoneration and sealing were specifically contingent upon compliance with the &quot;written deferral agreement&quot; suggested that such remedies applied only to deferred sentences imposed after the date of amendment. Moreover, the amendments conferred a substantive right on persons who formerly were not subject to exoneration, further indicating prospective application, although the statute was remedial in nature. Therefore, the statute did not apply to appellant, whose deferred sentence was entered in 2003.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, 15 minor children and their parents who participated in a truancy program, brought an action in the Superior Court, Providence County (Rhode Island) against defendants, a chief judge, magistrates and court administrators (judicial defendants), and five municipalities and their school superintendents (administrative defendants), contending that their constitutional rights were being violated as a result of court procedural errors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The students and parents sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as relief under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. The judicial and administrative defendants moved to dismiss. The trial justice denied the motions. The administrator defendants then petitioned for a writ of certiorari. The appellate court was confident that a person of average intelligence need neither guess nor speculate about the number of absences that would result in a referral to the Truancy Diversion Program. The administrative order's specific and clarified procedure afforded children and parents sufficient notice of what conduct would subject them to a truancy proceeding and the manner in which the child and parents would receive notice of a truancy petition. The constitutional challenge to the sufficiency of the notice requirement was mooted by the administrative order. The administrative order safeguarded children from arbitrary bureaucratic action by essentially permitting the child and parents to choose either to participate voluntarily and waive service or to avail themselves of the juvenile calendar and its service. There was no ongoing controversy in which the students and parents had an articulable stake.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the trial court was quashed. The matter was remanded with directions to enter a judgment dismissing the civil action as moot.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that &sect; 34-4-26(a), which provided that a right of first refusal expired 10 years after instrument in which it appeared was executed, extinguished defendant's right of first refusal as to the parcel, dock, and business. Defendant argued on appeal that &sect; 34-4-26 did not apply to the &quot;mixed property&quot; described in the agreement. The high court disagreed. The agreement granted defendant a right of first refusal on the business and dock only when purchased in conjunction with the parcel, and no precedent held that &sect; 34-4-26 did not apply to &quot;mixed transactions.&quot; The trial justice did not err in declining to characterize &sect; 34-4-26 as a notice statute, as notice statutes distinguished between those with notice of another's interest in property and those without such notice, while &sect; 34-4-26 applied only to recorded instruments affecting real estate; the world was therefore on notice of all instruments within &sect; 34-4-26's reach.</SPAN></P>

At the postconviction relief hearing, trial counsel testified as to the plethora of times that he had discussed &quot;at some length&quot; with the prisoner that, if he pled nolo contendere, he would be deported.

The supreme court disagreed because indicia of criminality gave defendant a right to a jury trial, providing jurisdiction under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 12-22-1 and 12-22-9. The ordinance was not preempted by state law because (1) it did not conflict with R.I. Gen.

The ordinance was not void for vagueness because (1) ordinary people could understand the prohibited level of volume, and (2) it did not encourage arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement, as it plainly stated where noise was prohibited, had a reasonableness standard, and guided law enforcement officers in its prima facie evidence provision. It was not overly broad because (1) it was narrowly tailored to serve the substantial and content-neutral governmental interest of maintaining citizens' health and welfare in residential areas, and (2) it left open alternative communication channels, so impermissible applications were not substantial related to its legitimate sweep.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Providence County Superior Court (Rhode Island) that denied his motion to correct an illegal sentence pursuant to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35; defendant claimed that his sentence was illegal because the provisions of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 12-29-5 (1956) only applied to individuals with two prior misdemeanor convictions, and one of his predicate offenses was a felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The information alleged that defendant called the victim 10 times from a correctional institution. It also alleged that he had been convicted of first degree-sexual assault, assault with a dangerous weapon, misdemeanor assault, and malicious damage. Defendant pleaded nolo contendere to violating a no-contact order. The state supreme court found, inter alia, that although it was framed in the terms of a Rule 35 motion, defendant's argument was not an attack on the legality of his sentence, but rather on the propriety of his conviction--namely, that the State improperly charged him with a violation of &sect; 12-29-5. However, by virtue of his knowing and voluntary decision to enter a plea of nolo contendere, defendant unequivocally waived all nonjurisdictional defects in the information. He did not assert that &sect; 12-29-5 was unconstitutional or that the information was so deficient that it failed to charge him with an offense. The sentence was not illegal because it was well within the prescribed statutory limit of &sect; 12-29-5(c)(1)(ii). Accordingly, the hearing justice did not err when she denied defendant's Rule 35 motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers, members of the state legislature, filed a complaint for declaratory relief seeking a ruling that the process the General Assembly used to allocate $2.3 million in state money for legislative grants to local and private organizations in the FY2008 budget violated R.I. Const. arts. 5,6, and 9. The Superior Court, Providence County (Rhode Island), granted defendant elected officials' motion to dismiss. A taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers were ten members of the Rhode Island House of Representatives. But, they brought the action in their individual capacities as Rhode Island taxpayers, and not in their capacities as elected officials. The trial court held that Rhode Island did not recognize taxpayer standing and, moreover, the taxpayers lacked standing because they were unable to articulate a particularized injury that was distinct from any suffered by the general public. Only one taxpayer perfected the appeal. The taxpayer complained of no concrete, particularized harm; to the degree he was able to point to any injury, it was the same, indistinguishable, generalized wrong allegedly suffered by the public at large. Furthermore, plaintiff was clearly attempting to use the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 9-30-1 et seq., to secure an advisory opinion that related to hypothetical future conduct of the General Assembly. Finally, the court declined to exercise its discretion to apply the substantial public interest exception.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant alleged that the State deliberately withheld exculpatory evidence from him and coerced a witness to lie. The supreme court held that the applicant did not meet his burden of showing sufficient evidence of the State's coercion of the witness. The record was devoid of any support for the applicant's contention that the police took additional profile photographs of him, showed them to the witness, and after the witness was still unable to identify the applicant, coerced the witness into denying at trial that he was shown the additional profile photographs. The applicant failed to show that any discovery violation occurred. There was no error in the hearing justice's determination that the witness's identification of the applicant was not based on any identification from a photograph but was instead based on the witness having seen the crime. Because of the abundant evidence of the applicant's guilt, even if the State produced his arrest photographs during trial, such production would not have avoided his conviction.

The claim lacked merit because (1) he was properly found in civil contempt as he had a chance to purge himself, (2) denying his motion to purge himself was of no moment since he did not comply by participating in treatment. His criminal contempt sentence did not violate the Eighth Amendment because (1) he repeatedly refused to obey orders seeking his rehabilitation, which was of highest priority, given the unusually brutal murders he committed, and (2) his refusal was a grave public danger and a criminal offense against the court's dignity. It was not error to find he violated probation when serving an unrelated sentence because (1) an implied condition of good behavior attached when sentence was pronounced, and (2) the issue had been rejected, so res judicata barred its consideration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's attorney erroneously advised the trial justice that the decision as to whether or not to waive the jury belonged to him as defendant's attorney and not to defendant. Thus, the trial court forced defendant to choose between defending himself pro se or proceeding to trial with an attorney who refused to implement defendant's personal right to waive a jury trial. Because defendant was never provided with the third choice of a bench trial represented by counsel and was never properly informed that the decision as to whether or not to waive the jury was his to make, defendant's decision to waive his right to counsel was not voluntary, knowing, or intelligent. Accordingly, the trial court erred in determining that defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to counsel under U.S. Const. amend. VI. The appellate court imparted a specific instruction to the trial court with respect to the proceedings on remand, noting that an adjudication of guilt of second degree child abuse under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-9-5.3 required a determination as to whether or not defendant inflicted a serious physical injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The Kent County Superior Court (Rhode Island) entered judgment in favor of the town officials. The developer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the town made efforts to increase the availability of affordable housing in accordance with the Rhode Island Low and Moderate Income Housing Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 45, ch. 53, the provisions in the town's ordinances that provided for the imposition of the &quot;fee-in-lieu&quot; were not authorized by the General Assembly. Although fees-in-lieu may have ultimately been determined to be an effective means of achieving compliance with the statutory mandate, strategies involving the imposition of fees-in-lieu first required the explicit authorization of the General Assembly so that the desirability and possible effects of the imposition of such fees-in-lieu was evaluated in the context of statewide affordable housing policy. Further, a statutory framework that provided specific guidance with respect to the calculation, imposition, and use of such fees-in-lieu was necessary in order to ensure that the fees-in-lieu were reasonable and rationally related to local needs. Although the State director of administration approved the town's comprehensive plan, which included language about a fee-in-lieu as a proposed strategy, such approval was not the equivalent of legislative authorization.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer said the commission violated its procedural and substantive due process rights, under the Rhode Island Constitution, by &quot;registering&quot; features on its land as historical cemeteries. The supreme court disagreed because the commission was purely advisory, as it had no authority to &quot;register&quot; cemeteries, so the developer had no &quot;protected liberty interest&quot; in its actions, irrespective of its intent, as it did not bar the developer from developing the land or have any other legal effect on the developer. It was no error to dismiss the developer's slander of title claim because a planning board, when denying the developer a permit to develop the land, (1) did not rely on the commission's statements that features on the land were identified as historical cemeteries, but, rather, on independent expert testimony, so the developer did not show the commission caused any pecuniary loss to the developer, (2) the planning board's independent decision was a superseding cause of any such loss, and (3) the planning board denied the permit for reasons other than the possible existence of historical cemeteries.</SPAN></P>

Although the inmate ultimately pled guilty to a lesser charge of manslaughter, the inmate contended that his conviction should be vacated because of what he contended was an inherently flawed indictment, which, he maintained, was a defect not waived by his plea. The supreme court noted that, by pleading guilty, the inmate was deemed to have waived any pre-plea constitutional arguments unless he, in fact, presented the unwaivable issue that the indictment failed to state an offense. The court held that the indictment did not charge the inmate with a nonexistent crime, because, in Rhode Island, drug distribution crimes could form the predicate felony for a felony murder charge. As such, by voluntarily pleading guilty to a charge that was amended with his consent, the inmate waived any argument that the State could not have proven him guilty of murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants said the act violated home rule under R.I. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 4. The supreme court disagreed because it (1) applied generally, and (2) did not alter the city's form of government, as the Director's and receiver's powers were channeled, incidental, and temporary. A separation of powers claim failed because (1) it did not apply to cities, and (2) coordinate branches of government were not involved. A substantive due process claim under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 45-9-7 failed because nothing showed the act had no substantial relation to citizen safety and welfare. A vagueness claim failed because (1) not defining &quot;fiscal emergency&quot; did not make the act unconstitutional, and (2) power was permissibly delegated to the Director. Overbreadth claims failed because (1) they were speculative, and (2) a receiver could exercise an office's powers only to its limits. An equal protection claim that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 45-9-9 created classes of union members and nonunion members failed because they were not similarly situated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner agreed to furnish the Lottery with VLTs; its compensation was a statutory percentage of the VLTs' net terminal income. The Division issued petitioner a notice of deficiency for unpaid use tax for the materials used to construct the VLTs. Petitioner argued that its agreement with the Lottery constituted a tax-exempt lease, not a license, because the Lottery paid consideration for the VLTs and exercised complete dominion and control over them. The high court held the agreement created a license because 1) the agreement used the term &quot;license&quot;; 2) R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-61.2-3(1) authorized the Lottery to license technology providers but not to enter into leases; and 3) the substance of the arrangement showed it was a license rather than a lease. Petitioner made a taxable use of the VLTs in Rhode Island by retaining title to them and exercising powers incident to its ownership by, inter alia, keeping them up-to-date with new games. The Lottery's ultimate control over the VLTs did not prevent petitioner from engaging in a taxable use of them.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was acquitted by reason of insanity of murdering her twelve-year-old daughter, appealed from an order of the Providence County Superior Court (Rhode Island), committing her to the custody of the director of the Rhode Island Department of Mental Health, Retardation, and Hospitals (MHRH), pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 40.1-5.3-4(e) (1956), for care and treatment at an inpatient facility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued on appeal that: (1) the evidence was insufficient to support the finding that she was dangerous; (2) the trial justice failed to consider the precise circumstances of defendant's conduct, which gave rise to the insanity acquittal; and (3) the trial justice should have ordered defendant into a community-based outpatient facility instead of inpatient treatment. Although two subsequent reports indicated defendant was experiencing active psychosis, the appeal from the initial commitment order was not moot because defendant had a continuing stake in the outcome. The evidence met the State's agreed-upon burden of clear and convincing evidence that defendant's unsupervised release would create a likelihood of serious harm, as required by &sect; 40.1-5.3-4(c). Defendant's dangerousness was a legal finding, not a medical determination. Defendant did not produce any evidence to dispute the finding. The motivation underlying defendant's psychotic delusions was not relevant to the question of dangerousness. Section 40.1-5.3-4 did not grant the trial justice the authority to order at the initial commitment hearing the placement of defendant in a community-based outpatient setting.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court perceived no basis for holding that the hearing justice erred in ruling that the inmate was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel at his trial. Among other things, the record indicated that the trial justice did not err in finding that trial counsel sufficiently investigated the defense of insanity or diminished capacity and made a strategic decision not the employ such a defense after a psychiatrist's observations appeared to be more damaging than helpful. Trial counsel's advice that the inmate should proceed with a jury-waived trial on the hope of garnering leniency at sentencing was a sound tactical decision. While appellate counsel did provide ineffective assistance by failing to seek a de novo review of the appropriateness of a sentence of life without the possibility of parole, the supreme court concluded that the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated that the murder was committed in a manner involving torture or aggravated battery to the victim and thus, the sentence was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court held that the environmental groups were aggrieved parties. The allegations of impropriety with respect to the off-the-record compromise plan supported the trial justice's decision to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether procedural irregularities occurred at the agency hearings. The quasi-judicial immunity of the CRMC members repeatedly was violated. The member's and the chairman's communications with the CRMC staff members about the compromise plan and the plan itself were ex parte contacts. The compromise plan should have been included in the administrative record and subject to cross-examination. The chairman's contacts with the Rhode Island Governor and his staff were also impermissible ex parte contacts. It was error to subtract the votes of the biased members and elevate the subcommittee recommendation to the CRMC's final decision. The case should have been remanded to supplement the record with the ex parte communications. The chairman and the former member were properly disqualified for bias under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The member was improperly disqualified.</SPAN></P>

The case was remanded to the trial court with instructions that it remand this matter to the CRMC for further proceedings, consistent with the opinion, on a supplemented record before the CRMC as it was now constituted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a group of related business entities, and intervenor, the Rhode Island tax administrator, sought common-law certiorari from the court to review the order of the Superior Court (Rhode Island), which denied a motion to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Plaintiff consumers filed a yet-to-be certified class action suit alleging deceptive trade practices and common-law negligence against defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' suit essentially asserted that defendants improperly collected a tax on the service contracts that were purchased when they purchased a computer. The central issue raised by defendants and the tax administrator was that the Superior Court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the complaint because, in essence, it was a tax case and plaintiffs were required to exhaust their administrative remedies first, with the Rhode Island Division of Taxation and, secondly, by an appeal in a district court, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-19-18 (1956). The court disagreed, holding that the case was a deceptive trade practice cause of action over which the Superior Court had jurisdiction as well as had ancillary jurisdiction over the common-law negligence claim, notwithstanding the amount in controversy. The court rejected the case law presented by the tax administrator since the gravamen of the complaint in that action was a taxation aggrievement. The court noted that there was nothing in the Rhode Island Deceptive Trade Practices Act, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 6-13.1-4 (1956), which required exhaustion of administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order, quashed the writ, and remand the case to the Superior Court for trial.</SPAN></P>

The first defendant and second defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first defendant and second defendant were seen at a New Year's celebration working on guns they possessed.

One person in the vehicle was killed and another person was permanently paralyzed. The first defendant and second defendant were convicted by a jury of the same nine offenses, including first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, assault, and committing a crime of violence. The state supreme court found that: (1) the denial of their R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal was proper since the evidence supported the convictions; (2) the jury was properly instructed; (3) the trial court acted within its discretion in the amount of testimony it directed a stenographer to read back to the jury based upon its read-back request; and (4) a constitutional challenge to the jury composition was not properly presented for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Rhode Island Ethics Commission found probable cause to support allegations that plaintiff state senator violated the Rhode Island Code of Ethics. It denied the senator's motion to dismiss the complaint and his demand for a jury trial. He sought judicial review. The Rhode Island superior court held that the senator was not entitled to a jury trial, but granted his motion to dismiss. Both parties petitioned for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A citizens group filed a complaint with the Commission alleging that, because the senator had a pecuniary relationship with a major pharmacy retailer and a health insurer, he had a conflict of interest when he voted against pharmacy freedom-of-choice legislation. The trial court held that the Commission was prohibited by the Speech in Debate Clause, R.I. Const. art. VI, &sect; 5, from inquiring into the senator's past legislative acts. The high court agreed. The Speech in Debate Clause provided legislators with absolute immunity from questioning by any other branch of government for their acts in carrying out their duties relating to the legislative process. As long as the legislators' challenged actions, stripped of all considerations of intent and motive, were legislative in character, the doctrine of absolute legislative immunity protected them from such claims. The Ethics Amendment, R.I. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 7 and 8, did not create an exception to the Speech in Debate Clause. Because the senator's alleged actions were core legislative acts entitled to speech-in-debate immunity, the Commission could not question him about those acts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Superior Court, Providence County (Rhode Island) upholding the determination of the Sex Offender Board of Review that he should be classified as a Risk Level III offender  for purposes of community notification pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 11, ch. 37.1 (1956), the Sexual Offender Registration and Community Notification Act. Defendant had previously pled nolo contendere to four first degree sexual assaults.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended, inter alia, that his classification under the sex offender registration statute was improper because the statute, on its face and as applied, violated his right to procedural due process under the federal and state constitutions. Defendant further argued that, as applied, the statute violated his right to substantive due process and application of the statute to his case constituted a violation of the state constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws. While the supreme court concluded that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-37.1-15(a)(2) could be considered unconstitutional in some circumstances, insofar as it granted the superior court discretion to deny a sexual offender the right to a meaningful hearing as a part of judicial review of any risk level classification, there was no constitutional violation in the instant action, as defendant was granted a meaningful hearing. The supreme court also found, inter alia, that the Board did, at a basic level, consider all the factors required by the guidelines in assessing defendant's risk of re-offense, and that there was no ex post facto violation, as the sex offender registration process was a civil regulatory process.</SPAN></P>

The inmate had been convicted of multiple offenses, including discharge of a firearm while committing a crime of violence resulting in death, in violation of R.I. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of nine offenses, including the murder and weapon offenses.

The inmate thereafter sought correction of an illegal sentence pursuant to Rule 35, wherein he alleged that the mandatory life sentence that was imposed under &sect; 11-47-3.2, and which was to run consecutive to the sentence imposed on a second-degree murder conviction, was illegal because the anti-gun violence statute violated assorted constitutional rights. The trial court denied the motion upon finding that the inmate could not pursue constitutional averments under Rule 35. On appeal, the court agreed with the trial court's determination. It held that in moving under Rule 35, the inmate had to prove that the imposition of the mandatory, consecutive life sentence was not authorized by &sect; 11-47-3.2. However, based on the clear language of &sect; 11-47-3.2(b)(3) and (c), the trial court had no discretion but to impose that sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer filed a declaratory judgment action alleging that it had purchased a parcel of land about seven years after the town had adopted new zoning ordinances. The developer further asserted that it learned one year later that the amendments decreased the number of buildable lots within the property. The developer added that when enacting the zoning amendments, the town council had violated the procedural requirements for adopting zoning ordinances found in its Home Rule Chartee and that the developer's predecessor-in-title never had received notice of the proposed amendments, in violation of state law. A motion judge, however, agreed with the town that the developer's action was, in effect, an appeal of the enactment of the amendment to the zoning ordinance barred by the 30-day limit on appeals of the enactment of a zoning ordinance, under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 45-24-71(a). The state supreme court found that the motion judge did not have the discretion to determine that the developer's action was an appeal since the declaration prayed for by the developer, that the zoning ordinances were invalidly enacted, was not an impossibility.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that because defendant failed to properly object to the jury instructions as required by R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 30, he waived his right to appeal. The jury instructions did not implicate issues of constitutional dimension, which would counteract the requirements of Rule 30 that an objection to a jury instruction be raised before the jury retired to consider its verdict. The trial court sentenced defendant according to the guilty verdict the jury rendered. No new findings were required or made by the trial court during sentencing. The trial court did not err by allowing the State to amend the information to correct the date of the offense. There was no discernible prejudice to defendant because the amendment occurred before the jury was impaneled. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing testimony regarding restitution the co-conspirator paid to his uncle. Because the State had to prove that defendant conspired with another to commit a larceny, the testimony was relevant to show that the co-conspirator also conspired with respect to the theft of the money.</SPAN></P>

He also claimed that the trial court erred in allowing into evidence hearsay statements the victim made. Finally, he claimed he was denied the right to a speedy trial. The state supreme court found that his right to counsel was violated since he had a right to assistance of counsel at such a &quot;critical stage&quot; of the criminal proceedings, after he had been charged, and the investigator was effectively an agent of the State because the investigator had a statutory obligation pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 40-11-7(f) to forward to police any information she obtained concerning child abuse, which the State could use to prosecute defendant. It further found that the hearsay statements were admissible given the relaxed standards applicable to child abuse victims concerning the time requirement for excited utterances and that defendant did not show his speedy trial rights were violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court vacated the trial court's judgment of conviction and remanded the case to the trial court for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sheriffs appealed a judgment of the Superior Court, Providence County (Rhode Island), which was entered in favor of defendants, the Rhode Island Governor and the Director of the Department of Administration, in the sheriffs' action, alleging that they were improperly laid off. The trial court found that the layoffs were within the Governor's authority and were proper under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-29-1 (1956).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due to a severe fiscal crisis and significant budget deficit, the Governor instructed executive department heads to eliminate jobs. Accordingly, the sheriffs were each laid off. They filed suit, seeking mandamus, declaratory, and injunctive relief. The sheriffs asserted that they were appointed to 10-year terms and there was no just cause for their removal under &sect; 42-29-1. The trial court found that the Governor had the inherent authority to terminate the sheriffs' employment. It further found that the economic distress in the State constituted just cause under &sect; 42-29-1. On appeal, the court found that under the clear and unambiguous language of &sect; 42-29-1(a), the sheriffs were appointed for 10-year terms, whether they were appointed before or after February 1, 2001. The only removal provision was based on a finding of just cause under &sect; 42-29-1(b). However, based on the lack of language indicating that such just cause could be based on economic distress, the court held that such was not a statutory basis of just cause. Rather, it interpreted the term &quot;just cause&quot; as relating to personal deficiencies of an employee. Accordingly, the layoffs in the instant matter were improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties to a consent decree agreed to a process for resolving civilian complaints against the city's police officers. Three years later, the General Assembly enacted the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights (LEOBOR), which set forth in R.I. Gen.

More than 25 years after LEOBOR was enacted, the city enacted an ordinance providing for civilian oversight of the city's police department, set forth at Providence, R.I., Providence External Review Authority Providence Code &sect; 18 1/2-2(a). The two police officers were notified that the city was investigating them, and asked the trial court for declaratory and injunctive relief regarding the city's ordinance. The trial court found that the ordinance was valid. The state supreme court held that (1) the ordinance was not unconstitutional since it allowed for investigations and recommendations, but left discipline to the police chief under LEOBOR, (2) the General Assembly in enacting LEOBOR did not indicate an intent to preempt the field regarding police misconduct, and (3) the ordinance was not a basis for disciplining police officers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, various former lead pigment manufacturers and a national trade association of lead producers, challenged a judgment of the Superior Court, Providence County (Rhode Island), imposing liability on the manufacturers for creating a public nuisance, in an action by the Attorney General (AG) on behalf of the State of Rhode Island. The supreme court consolidated various appeals and cross-appeals into five tracks for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As to track one, regarding two manufacturers, the supreme court concluded that the trial justice erred by denying their R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. More specifically, the State had not and could not allege any set of facts to support its public nuisance claim that would establish that the manufacturers interfered with a public right or that they were in control of the lead pigment they, or their predecessors, manufactured at the time it caused harm to Rhode Island children. As to track four regarding contempt findings, given the nature of the case--a highly contentious matter laden with public commentary from both sides and a high degree of public and media interest--the supreme court did not think the AG knew or reasonably should have known that his remarks in response to reporters would prejudice defendants. Furthermore, defendants had not alleged or shown that any jurors saw or were influenced by them. As to track five, contingent fee agreements between the AG and outside private counsel were found to be proper, as they would be subject to oversight and scrutiny before payment was made to counsel and before any net amount would be payable to the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of abatement with respect to the two manufacturers was reversed. The judgment with respect to a third manufacturer was affirmed. The contempt findings of the Superior Court were reversed. The validity of the contingency fee agreements between the AG and outside counsel was recognized.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court, Providence County (Rhode Island), of first-degree murder. The trial justice imposed a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment and a concurrent sentence for possession of a firearm without a license. Defendant filed a pro se application for postconviction relief. The trial justice granted the State of Rhode Island's motion to dismiss. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the mandatory life sentence that was imposed under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-23-2 (1956) was part of a faulty sentencing hearing in violation of the separation of powers guarantees of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions in that the mandatory sentencing scheme the Rhode Island Legislature adopted encroached upon the judiciary's sentencing discretion. On appeal, the court found that defendant's rights under R.I. Const. art. 5 were not violated because the Legislature, by enacting the sentencing scheme in R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-23-2 did not usurp the judicial power by depriving the trial justice of his or her sentencing discretion as it was for the Legislature, not the courts, to prescribe the scope of punishments. Accordingly, the mandatory sentence imposed for first-degree murder was lawful. In addition, the summary dismissal of the case by the trial justice was appropriate, as provided for in R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 10-9.1-6(b) (1956), because the question before the justice was a question of law, and defendant was afforded an opportunity to respond, and did respond, to the motion to dismiss. Further, the justice considered defendant's argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was shot during a robbery of his store.

The cellmate died before defendant's trial before a jury. Defendant was found guilty of murder, first-degree robbery, and other offenses. The state supreme court found that (1) his recorded statements were properly admitted, as he did not invoke his right to consult with an attorney while a detective questioned him during two interviews, (2) playing for the jury the recorded statements between defendant and the cellmate did not violate his Confrontation Clause rights because the statements were not offered for their truth, (3) admission of the wife's 911 call was proper to help identify defendant as the robber, (4) and the mandatory consecutive life sentence imposed on defendant pursuant to R.I.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was charged with unlawful possession of a controlled substance, the Attorney General declined to file a criminal information. The District Court, Providence County (Rhode Island) then granted his motions to destroy and seal his records under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 12-1-12 and 12-1-12.1 on the ground that the statutes' distinction between felons and non-felons violated the Equal Protection Clause. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State objected to the motions on the ground that defendant had previously been convicted of a felony offense. The statutes allowed persons acquitted or exonerated of a crime to have certain records destroyed and court records sealed if they did not have a previous felony conviction, while those with prior felony convictions were denied similar relief. Applying a rational basis standard, the court held that the State's interest in effective law enforcement represented one rational basis justifying the classification. Felons' arrest records, even acquittals and exonerations, could help in identifying patterns of criminal activity and in the identification and apprehension of criminals. Additionally, the court had previously found effective law enforcement to be an important state interest. Maintaining records of felons' arrests aided the State's legitimate interest in law enforcement, and the statutory distinction between felons and non-felons rationally related to this interest. Accordingly, the distinction did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The seller argued on appeal that the buyer and his counsel engaged in a series of machinations that sought to cloud the true state of affairs, unreasonably and unfairly delaying the closing, towards the end of satisfying the buyer's own pecuniary interests. He also alleged that marketable title could not be conveyed at the time set for closing. But, the instant court disagreed, based on the evidence presented to the trial justice. First, the parties agreed to postpone the closing date until the provisions of the Marketable Record Title Act barred any claim to lot No. 463, thus advancing the interest of both parties. Second, both sides continued to work toward a closing, while fully aware of the issues that had to be resolved. In doing so, the buyer was thwarted by the permit-approval process and delays caused by the seller. Fourth, any delay in performing the contract was not caused by the buyer, nor did he benefit from the delay to the seller's detriment. Finally, time was not of the essence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile challenged a judgment of the Family Court, Providence County (Rhode Island), which adjudicated him delinquent for committing second-degree child molestation sexual assault in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-37-8.3 (1956), ruled that the Sexual Offender Registration and Community Notification Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 11, ch. 37.1 (1956), was constitutional, and ordered him to register as a sex offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that the family court did not err in finding defendant guilty of second-degree child molestation sexual assault. The family court's finding that the victim was a credible witness was rationally supported by competent evidence. The supreme court concluded that the Registration Act was constitutional as applied to juveniles, and defendant was not entitled to a jury trial. The nature of the juvenile-justice system was not significantly compromised by a sex-offender-registration requirement. Both the registration and any information accompanying it were available only to law enforcement agencies and were not disseminated to the public at large. The Registration Act was not inconsistent with the prevailing view that juvenile proceedings generally had to be confidential. The confidentiality afforded to a juvenile was not absolute. Sometimes confidentiality had to give way to other legitimate societal priorities. The purpose of the Registration Act was not to punish the offending juvenile but to protect the safety and general welfare of the public. Because the registration requirement did not constitute criminal punishment, there was no right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the superior court lacked jurisdiction to hear his case and claimed that the charging statute did not apply to him personally. To support this assertion, he argued that he was a &quot;sovereign state citizen&quot; of the State of Rhode Island, and, as such, he had a fundamental right under the Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution to travel without interference from the state. But, the instant court disagreed. First, the instant court found that defendant failed to address the issue of jurisdiction. Second, the court found that defendant did not have a fundamental right to unregulated travel by automobile within the State of Rhode Island, as the right to use the public highways was one which properly could be regulated as a valid exercise of the state's police power. Finally, strict scrutiny did not apply. Instead, R.I. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was twice convicted of breaking and entering. Both times, part of his sentence was spent on probation. Thereafter, he was again arrested on that charge. The State filed a R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 32(f) notice of a probation violation. A magistrate of the trial court presided over the probation violation hearing. The evidence indicated that relatives of defendant saw him at a party at a place other than the break-in location. The relatives left because they did not like him. A little while later, they returned when they learned defendant had left. When one relative soon left again, she saw defendant's car in her driveway and defendant coming out of the garage. The relative found the house ransacked. A witness for defendant testified defendant was at a club at the time of the ransacking. The magistrate found defendant violated his probation. The state supreme court found that (1) his claim that the statute authorizing the magistrate to preside over the hearing was unconstitutional was waived since it was not raised in the trial court and was not a novel issue, and (2) the evidence presented, though conflicting, sufficiently supported revocation of his probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action seeking, among other things, declaratory relief, the Superior Court, Providence County (Rhode Island) granted judgment to the Department of Environmental Management (DEM), after a fisherman appealed the denial of a principal-effort license to commercially fish certain restricted species, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-35-15. Thus, the fisherman appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon a review of the evidence in light of the fisherman's constitutional claims, the instant court first held that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 20-2.1-5 did not frustrate the fisherman's fundamental right to pursue a lawful calling because he continued to possess a license to fish commercially, and he did not have a fundamental right to have a specific license. Second, there was nothing discriminatory or invidious in limiting the number of licenses in relation to the condition of the species itself, and then allocating those limited licenses on the basis of who was there first. Third, there was no class of citizens that was being discriminated against, and the fisherman did not argue that he was a member of a discrete and insular minority, entitling him to such a classification. Thus, because limiting access to different species via limited licensing was related directly to the goals of maintaining the viability of those stocks and the fishing trade that depended upon them, the objectives of this scheme were legitimate and complied with the legislature's constitutional duty of preserving marine fisheries. Further, limiting the entry of new licenses was a rational way to achieve those goals.</SPAN></P>

Another officer who knew defendant showed the officer defendant's picture. Defendant was arrested a few months later. A federal agent told defendant that the agent would advise the prosecutor and judge if defendant was truthful of defendant's cooperation. The officer and witness testified at trial about observing defendant and identified him in-court. Defendant was then convicted by a jury on three offenses and found guilty on a fourth offense under an agreement. The state supreme court found the officer's identification was not unduly suggestive, the witness was able to sufficiently observe defendant, defendant voluntarily confessed to the agent despite an offer of assistance for doing so, and there was no requirement that defemdant's prior criminal history be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt before defendant could be sentenced as a habitual offender under R.I.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff town brought an action for declaratory judgment against defendant Department of Environmental Management (DEM) in which defendant company intervened. The town argued that as an intervenor in an enforcement proceeding, it should have been afforded the opportunity to approve a settlement between the DEM and the company. The Superior Court, Providence County (Rhode Island) entered judgment in favor of the town. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DEM served the company with a Notice of Violation. The town intervened in administrative proceedings, which were closed after the DEM and the company entered into a consent agreement. The court first held that the trial court had jurisdiction to decide the case under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-35-7. The validity or applicability of an agency rule or practice could be decided in an action for declaratory relief, and was not barred by R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-35-15. The trial court's decision was erroneous, however. Because the DEM Rules and Regulations for Assessment of Administrative Penalties (AAP Rules) did not give an intervenor a right to a hearing, the company's withdrawal of its request for a hearing effectively ended the administrative process. Moreover, the AAP Rules and R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-17.7-2 (1956) and R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-35-9(d) authorized the director of the DEM to enter into a consent agreement without seeking any input from an intervenor. The town could not force the company to continue with the hearing. The settlement terminated the administrative proceeding, but did not affect the rights of the town to seek redress against the company, a course it had elected to pursue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants were seeking an appeal of a decision denying them Medicaid benefits. While awaiting a hearing, they learned of ex parte communications on the part of a hearing officer and brought the underlying complaint to enjoin such off-the-record communications about cases currently before a hearing officer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court, Providence County (Rhode Island), which ordered that a writ of mandamus be issued in a proceeding to foreclose the right of redemption to property purchased by a buyer at a tax sale. The writ directed the city treasurer to refund the amount the buyer had paid for the property at the tax sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax sale of the property occurred two days after a mortgage foreclosure sale. Appellee purchaser subsequently bought the property from the foreclosure sale buyer, and granted a mortgage to appellee mortgagee. The court determined that the superior court erred by invalidating the tax sale for lack of notice to the record owner under the provisions of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-9-10. R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 34-11-22 provided that a foreclosure conducted by statutory power of sale was a bar against the mortgagor. Thus, any interest that may have reposed in the record owner was forever barred by the foreclosure sale because she was the successor in interest to the mortgagor. At the time of the tax sale, she no longer held an interest in the property. The court declined appellees' invitation to affirm the superior court judgment on the basis of the municipal lien certificate, as R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-7-11 (1956) did not suggest that the title purchased at a tax sale was defeated merely by the subsequent issuance and recording of a municipal lien certificate that failed to list the tax sale, and the city had not been made a party to the proceedings when the issue was raised.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the superior court was vacated, the writ of mandamus was quashed, and the case was remanded to the superior court for further proceedings on the petition to foreclose the right of redemption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court, Providence County (Rhode Island), which convicted him of first-degree murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment. He was also sentenced to a consecutive term of imprisonment as a habitual offender pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 12-19-21 (1956). The trial court denied defendant's new trial motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A partially clad, decayed body was found in a ravine with a bullet hole in the back of the victim's skull. Years later, it was determined that defendant had executed the victim upon learning that he was a confidential police informant. Defendant had been engaged in a stolen-automobile operation with the victim and others. Defendant was indicted and after a jury trial, he was convicted and sentenced. On appeal, the court held that defendant's confrontation rights under U.S. Const. amend. VI and R.I. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10 were not violated by reading prior recorded testimony of an unavailable witness to the jury under R.I. R. Evid. 804(b)(1), as the witness had asserted his Fifth Amendment self-incrimination privilege. His later reappearance did not require a change as to his unavailability or a grant of immunity to him. There were no errors in the trial court's evidentiary rulings, and admission of a statement by the victim was proper under Rule 804(c). Defendant's motion to pass the case due to alleged juror bias was properly denied. The habitual offender sentence imposed by the trial court was proper, as jury findings were not required regarding prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a writ of certiorari, defendants, the State of Rhode Island, its Attorney General, and two other State officials, appealed the judgment of the Superior Court, Providence County (Rhode Island), which declared a portion of the Lead Hazard Mitigation Act (LHMA), R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-128.1-1 et seq. (2002), unconstitutional. Plaintiffs, rental property owners, brought a declaratory and injunctive relief action challenging the LHMA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' primary contention was that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-128.1-8(e)(4) (2005), which exempted owner-occupied two- and three-unit dwellings from the mandates of the LHMA, resulted in different treatment for similarly situated property owners without regard to any lead hazard to children. Plaintiffs asserted that the LHMA was arbitrary in treating owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied dwellings of the same size differently and in treating owner-occupied two- and three-unit dwellings differently from owner-occupied four- or five-unit dwellings. The trial court declared &sect; 42-128.1-8(e)(4)&nbsp;unconstitutional, as being violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Rhode Island Constitution upon concluding that there was no rational basis for allowing the children who lived in two- and three-unit owner-occupied buildings to be at risk while children living in other units enjoyed the protections of the LHMA. The court found error, concluding that the classification passed constitutional muster because the Rhode Island General Assembly rationally could have concluded that the legislation was one step toward resolving the problem of lead poisoning of children in Rhode Island.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision and remanded the case to the trial court for entry of final judgment in accordance with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant pursued another person and fired gunshots at that person's vehicle. He missed and mistakenly shot a four-year-old girl while she was playing with her brother. At the applicant's trial, the state proceeded upon a theory of transferred intent to murder. In its jury instructions, the trial court informed the jury that the theory of transferred intent also applied to the two charges of assault with a deadly weapon. The jury found the applicant guilty of, inter alia, assaulting the girl with intent to murder, assaulting the brother with a dangerous weapon, and unlawfully discharging a firearm. The applicant's conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. His first and second applications for postconviction relief were also denied. Thereafter, the applicant filed a third application for postconviction relief and raised new claims. The trial court summarily denied the third application. On appeal, the state supreme court found the postconviction relief statute,&nbsp;R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 10-9.1-8, barred his third application since he raised new claims and did not explain why he could not have raised or have ruled upon those claims in his first and second applications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant sought review of a decision entered by the Superior Court, Washington County (Rhode Island), which denied his application for postconviction relief. Applicant had been convicted of second-degree child molestation and simple assault, and on the second-degree child molestation conviction, applicant was sentenced to 20 years, with 15 years to be served at the Adult Correctional Institutions and the other five years suspended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of postconviction relief. With respect to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim under U.S. Const. amend. VI, applicant claimed that trial counsel should have presented witnesses to impeach the mother of the complaining witness, with whom he had a romantic relationship, as biased against him and should have introduced medical records indicating that no sexual penetration occurred. The court found that trial counsel made appropriate tactical decisions because the credibility of a collateral witness, such as the mother, did not matter and applicant was acquitted of first-degree molestation charges, the only charges for which the medical records would have probative value. Although applicant claimed his sentence on the second-degree child molestation conviction violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII and R.I. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, the court held that the sentence fell within the range set out in R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-37-8.4 (1956) and the appropriate analysis was whether the sentence was proportionate to the crime. A departure from the sentencing benchmarks was proper based on applicant's extensive criminal history.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Rhode Island Commission on Judicial Tenure and Discipline found that petitioner district judge violated R.I. Sup. Ct. art. VI, Canons 2A, 3B.2, 3B.8, and 3B.9, and recommended a sanction of censure. The judge filed a petition requesting the state's high court to reject the Commission's findings and recommendations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge told a defendant that if he admitted to being in contempt of court because of his past failures to appear, he would receive a six-month jail sentence and his outstanding fines and court costs would be eliminated. Defendant asked if he could speak to an attorney with the public defender's office. The judge said he could, but if he did, the offer would be withdrawn. Defendant accepted the offer without conferring with an attorney. The Commission found that the judge had engaged in threatening behavior and that his actions were coercive, prosecutorial, and a violation of defendant's constitutional rights. The high court rejected the judge's claim that the Commission's procedures resulted in a merger of investigatory, prosecutorial, and adjudicatory functions that denied him due process. The judge was not entitled to discovery because there was no merger of the Commission's prosecutorial and adjudicative functions. The Commission erred in finding that the judge engaged in threats or coercive conduct, but its finding that he violated R.I. Sup. Ct. art. VI, Canons 2A and 3B.8 was supported by the record. In view of the judge's distinguished record, censure was not appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court rejected the Commission's finding that the judge engaged in threats or coercive conduct, but affirmed its finding that he violated R.I.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued defendant treasurer, seeking damages for injuries suffered by plaintiff in a park owned by the treasurer's city. The Superior Court, Providence County (Rhode Island), granted defendant's motion for summary judgment, holding that the Recreational Use Statute,&nbsp;R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 32-6-1 et seq., relieved the treasurer of liability and that plaintiff had not established the statute's unconstitutionality. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While walking in the park, plaintiff was attacked by a swarm of bees as she approached a park bench. Attempting to evade the bees, she began running, tripped, and fell. The treasurer argued that because the city was entitled to limited immunity under the Recreational Use Statute, summary judgment was proper. Citing R.I. Const. art. 1, &sect; 5, plaintiff argued on appeal that the motion justice erred in his application of the Recreational Use Statute and asserted that the statute completely barred people injured because of the negligence of the property owner from a remedy. The appellate court disagreed. Plaintiff's argument that the Recreational Use Statute deprived her of a remedy to which she otherwise would have been entitled was without merit. After discovering a recreational user in a position of peril, landowners were required to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity. A litigant's inability to prove that particular conduct breached a statutory duty did not offend the constitution. Plaintiff's argument that the Recreational Use Statute did not apply to state and municipal owned property was not properly before the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the appeal of the underlying condemnation action, the state supreme court determined that the state's quick-take condemnation statute was constitutional on its face, but that the taking of the owner's garage violated U.S. Const. amend.

The court's mandate directed that the garage was to be returned to the owner, and that its contract rights were be restored as of the date of the purported taking. On remand, the trial court concluded that the mandate had only prospective effect, and that the taking was not deemed void ab initio. The trial court then directed the entry of a judgment in favor of the economic development corporation and the airport corporation. The state supreme court found that there was nothing prospective about its prior mandate. The owner was entitled to an accounting as of the date of the purported taking.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial justice erred in admitting a statement the victim made to an acquaintance days before the murder under R.I. R. Evid. 804(c). The supreme court found no error, holding that the subject statement as not &quot;testimonial,&quot; and thus, was not subject to the Confrontation Clause. The subject statement was made to the acquaintance days before the murder and could not reasonably have been made with a belief that it would be available for use at a later trial. Next, the supreme court held that there was no abuse of discretion when the trial justice allowed the State's expert to respond to hypothetical questions; among other things, there was no deficiency in the disclosure of facts necessary for the expert to render an opinion. Although defendant failed to preserve for review the issue of whether a detective's identification testimony was inadmissible hearsay, the supreme court concluded that any error in its admission was harmless. Finally, the supreme court held that convictions for first-degree murder and discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence, resulting in death did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause in R.I.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff electrical contractor filed a petition against defendants, a site development company, its president, and a construction company, to enforce a mechanic's lien and for breach of contract. Defendants filed counterclaims for breach of contract and negligence. The Superior Court of Providence County (Rhode Island) denied the petition and awarded defendants damages on their counterclaims. The contractor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a bench trial, the trial court held that the mechanic's lien statute,&nbsp;R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 34-28-1 et seq. (1956), even as amended by R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 34-28-17.1, was unconstitutional. The court noted that after the trial court rendered its decision, the present court had held that the statute did not violate due process. Remand was unnecessary, however, because the trial court had not based its decision solely upon its erroneous holding that the statute was unconstitutional. It had addressed the contractor's breach of contract claim and defendants' counterclaims and had found that defendants were the ones who were owed money. In considering the conflicting evidence offered at trial, the trial court had carried out its task of determining which evidence was credible and which was not. The trial court had appropriately drawn inferences from the testimony and evidence offered. As the court found those inferences to have been reasonable ones to draw, it afforded the trial court's findings great weight. Accordingly, the trial court was not clearly wrong in finding that defendants were entitled to damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On a writ of certiorari, defendant hospital requested the court to review the decision of the Superior Court, Kent County (Rhode Island), which granted the motion of plaintiff, an estate administratrix, whereby the hospital was required to produce in the course of discovery some 750 pages of documents pertaining to one of its doctors. The administratrix had brought a medical malpractice suit against the hospital and defendants, two doctors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dispute over discovery involved certain hospital documents concerning one of the doctors, primarily involving peer-review information. The hospital's primary contention was that the production of those documents would offend the peer-review privilege afforded by R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 23-17-25 (1956) and R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 5-37.3-7 (1956). The trial justice conducted an in camera review and ordered the production of all 750 pages except that patient information, such as Social Security numbers, required redaction. The court upheld the trial justice's order as to the peer-review privilege, except as to one document deemed privileged, because the trial justice properly distinguished between a doctor's bedside manner and the actual medical care that a doctor administers in determining whether the requested documents were subject to discovery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, in part, the order of the trial court with respect to all the documents, except one deemed privileged. The court also affirmed the order with respect to the records of the board of medical licensure and discipline. The court quashed the order as to the attorney-client privilege and confidentiality act issues and remanded the case to the trial court for an in camera inspection with regard to those issues.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws &sect; 22-1-2 (1956) was constitutional and that there was no violation of the Compactness Clause of R.I. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Special Commission on Reapportionment recommended State and House district reapportionment plans, which were enacted by the Rhode Island General Assembly under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 22-1-2 and 22-2-2 (1956). Plaintiffs challenged the redistricting under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 22-1-2, asserting that the statute was unconstitutional because the districts did not meet the requirements of the Compactness Clause of the Rhode Island Constitution, R.I. Const. art. VIII, &sect;&nbsp;1, requiring that they be as compact or contiguous in territory as possible. The trial court justice found that the redistricting statute was not solely based on political considerations, did not violate the Compactness Clause, and was not unconstitutional. On appeal, the court adopted the trial court's decision. It noted that deferential review was given to legislative acts regarding redistricting, and the burden of proof of beyond a reasonable doubt as to the statute's unconstitutionality was properly placed on plaintiffs. There was no evidence of gerrymandering, each district possessed some areas of common interest, and the plan was reasonable and rational. The contiguity and compactness requirements were not violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer found an already-opened letter in defendant's personal mailbox, which was addressed to his brother. The brother never received or read the letter from defendant, who was in jail awaiting trial on one count of burglary and three counts of first-degree sexual assault. The letter essentially asked the brother to kill the victim of the charges against defendant. During an investigation, defendant's prison cell was searched. Defendant was tried for criminal solicitation of murder in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-1-9. At trial, the State obtained a motion in limine to exclude evidence of defendant's acquittal of the sexual assault charges. The State then referred in its opening statement to the sexual assault charges. Defendant did not object. Eventually, defendant was convicted. On appeal, the state supreme court found that defendant should have been tried for attempted criminal solicitation because the person solicited never received the soliciting instrument, the search of defendant's jail cell did not violate his constitutional rights, and defendant should not have been barred from introducing evidence of his acquittal on the sexual assault charges.</SPAN></P>

Laws &sect; 45-53-6(f)(1) of the Rhode Island Low and Moderate Income Housing Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 45, ch. 53, the Rhode Island State Housing Appeals Board (SHAB) refused to remand to defendant town an application by plaintiff developer for a comprehensive building permit, because a majority of SHAB's members had not found that the application met the test of substantial completeness. The developer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer sought a comprehensive permit for a residential development. Before the application could be heard, the legislature amended the Act and imposed a moratorium on all such permit applications by for-profit developers. The legislature enacted a procedure for determining which applications would proceed under the former Act and which would proceed under the amended version. SHAB requested the town to make its own findings as to whether the developer's application was substantially complete; the town found it was not. Though SHAB, by a four to three vote, found the application to be substantially complete, it declined to remand it to the town for comprehensive permit review because a majority of the nine members of SHAB had not found substantial completeness. The supreme court held that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 45-53-5 did not provide for direct appeals from SHAB's determination that a permit application failed to meet the test of substantial completeness. Pursuant to R.I. Const. art. 10, &sect; 2, relief could be sought in the supreme court by way of writ of certiorari. However, it declined to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction in the instant case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, airport parking garage lessor, bank, and real estate company, challenged an order of the Superior Court, Kent County (Rhode Island) granting a so-called quick-take condemnation in accordance with R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-64-9 (1956) of a temporary easement in the parking garage, based on an ex parte petition by appellee, the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation (EDC).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The garage lessor had an leasehold agreement in which it would manage the parking garage. A dispute arose between the owner and the lessor regarding the profitability of the valet parking arrangement that was written into the leasehold agreement by an amendment. The owner asked its parent company, the EDC, to condemn the valet parking amendment. The EDC eventually condemned the entire leasehold or temporary easement pursuant to the quick-take condemnation statute,&nbsp;R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-64-9. Appellants challenged the constitutionality of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-64-9 and also questioned whether, in fact, the taking was for a public use. The court held that &sect; 42-64-9, was constitutional on its face, but that the manner in which it was applied in the case failed to pass constitutional scrutiny. The exercise of the state's power of eminent domain did not meet the legitimate public purposes identified in the Act and was not a public use under the Takings Clause. The court found that the condemnation of a temporary easement in the garage was inappropriate, motivated by a desire for increased revenue, and was not undertaken for a legitimate public purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the superior court condemnation order and declared the condemnation void. The court ordered that the garage be returned to the garage lessor and that its contract rights be restored as of the date of the purported taking. The case was remanded to superior court for further consistent proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A patient alleged that defendants were negligent in failing to diagnose her with Hodgkins Lymphoma; the patient died from this disease. After a settlement was reached, the parties filed cross-motions for judgments as a matter of law, disputing whether the executrix was entitled to $ 381, 698, the amount of medical expenses that were paid by Rhode Island's Medicaid program. Defendants argued that under &sect; 9-19-34.1, the executrix's recovery should be reduced by the amount of the Medicaid payments. On appeal of the trial court's judgment for the executrix, the court affirmed. The court held that Medicaid was not a &quot;state income disability&quot; act, and thus did not fall within the list of collateral source payments that were admissible to reduce a plaintiff's damages under &sect; 9-19-34.1. The court found that &sect; 9-19-34.1 was not a remedial statute, and that the term &quot;income disability act&quot; meant an act that provided income to persons who were disabled. Medicaid did not fit this definition because many Medicaid recipients were not disabled, such as those who were aged 65 or older.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant adoptee appealed a judgment by the Providence County Family Court (Rhode Island) that denied his petition for access to his adoption records; the adoptee claimed that his religious convictions were of such a magnitude that the confidentiality ordinarily attached to adoption records had to be subordinated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The adoptee based his claim of entitlement to his adoption information upon his own understanding of the teachings of Mormonism. The adoptee submitted certain religious scriptures or texts that he asserted were supportive of his interpretation of Mormonism, but did not provide any expert testimony concerning the documents. The state supreme court found that the family court had before it nothing more than adoptee's ipse dixit as to his subjective interpretation of his religion. In addition, unless the adoptee's religious beliefs could be &quot;translated&quot; into a more secular context (such as being a constituent element of a particular psychological need), deferring to his beliefs would be a preferential treatment by government based upon religion. Such preferential treatment would be fraught with constitutional peril under R.I. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3 and the First Amendment. Because the adoptee fell far short of sustaining his burden of proving the existence of good cause, the family court properly denied his petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the jury at trial was whether defendant was in the breachway when the city's police officer stopped him and told him to get out of the water. The jury found against defendant. Defendant argued on appeal that the city's ordinance prohibiting swimming in the breachway was unconstitutionally vague on its face because it did not define the geographical area that constituted the breachway. The court disagreed and held that the city's ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because notice of the breachway's boundaries was provided by signs that specifically prohibited swimming within the boundaries, which defendant, admittedly, had seen. The court further held that the ordinance was within the city's police power to ensure public safety.</SPAN></P>

They challenged the adequacy of the board's findings as well as the constitutionality of the whole comprehensive permit process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The zoning board did not approve the developer's original application but did eventually approve an application for a project with fewer units. The court held that the decision was unreviewable as it stood because there were no real findings of fact. Therefore, although eventual review would be deferential, further proceedings would have to be held, and findings made. The court proceeded to consider the constitutional challenge, as the issues were likely to arise at a later stage, and found no violations of the Fourteenth Amendment vagueness prohibition or Rhode Island's non-delegation doctrine because &sect; 45-53-4 provided very clear guidance as to the basis on which an application could be denied. Furthermore, because there was no suspect classification involved and because the statute related closely and rationally to solution of a public welfare problem, there were no violations of substantive due process or equal protection. The court could not see how a challenge to the state housing agency's authority to issue certain regulations had anything to do with the case and did not address the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the decision and remanded the matter for proper findings, but it considered the constitutional issues on the merits for the parties' further guidance and found no constitutional problems.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant town appealed a grant of summary judgment in favor of plaintiff police chief by the by the Superior Court, Providence County (Rhode Island); the town claimed, inter alia, that the trial court improperly awarded attorney's fees to the police chief under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 9-1-45 (1956) for actions arising out of a breach of contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Approximately three years after the police chief's appointment was ratified by the town counsel, the new town administrator fired him without cause. She also informed him that his contract with the town was void. The state supreme court held that the plain terms of the town charter gave the town administrator to negotiate contracts, subject to a blessing by the town council. Despite the three-year term for benefit and compensation purposes, the parties acknowledged that the chief's tenure was for an indefinite period. Consequently, the contract was valid and enforceable. The position of chief of police was not terminable &quot;at will&quot; merely because it was for an indefinite term. Pursuant to Lincoln, R.I., Charter art. VI, &sect; 6-6(1), the town administrator could remove the police chief only after legally sufficient cause was shown. Once the temporary restraining order was issued, there was no need for the police chief to appeal. Finally, the award of counsel fees was proper because of the town' failure to uphold its end of the contract covenant of good faith.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the State provided conclusive evidence at trial that defendant was well aware that his advances toward the victim were unwelcome. Defendant was personally informed by management at the victim's place of employment that his efforts to contact her were causing her to feel uncomfortable and fearful. When he was arrested, defendant admitted his knowledge that his communications with the victim were unwanted. The State introduced numerous documents obtained from the hard drive of defendant's computer that clearly indicate that he was not only aware but also deeply disturbed and angered by the victim's reaction to his uninvited letters, poems, cards, and personal visits to the store.

Accordingly, he asserted that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss notice of duty to register. The State maintained that, because the inmate was released after July 1, 1992, he was required to register as a sexual offender. The supreme court concluded that defendant was not required to register under &sect; 11-37-16(a), which imposed registration duties upon certain individuals, which did not include defendant. The supreme court held that &sect; 11-37-16(b) could not be read as broadening the pool of those upon whom &sect; 11-37-16(a) imposed a duty, as it instructed officials to inform those offenders to whom &sect; 11-37-16(a) applied of their duty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former owner alleged that improper notice procedures were used in the foreclosure sale. The trial court found that the procedures used were proper and that the tax sale was valid.

The appellate court held that the former owner failed to articulate this argument in the trial court. Accordingly, that argument was not considered. The former owner's belatedly articulated constitutional argument did not involve a novel rule of law, and was not jurisdictional in nature. The trial court certainly had the power to hear the former owner's constitutional arguments if she had chosen to raise them in that forum. The former owner was deemed to have waived her constitutional arguments by not raising them initially in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws tit. 34, ch. 28, unconstitutional because it denied due process to landowners whose property was subject to a lien.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the enactment of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 34-28-17.1 (1956), which allowed a way for landowners to challenge mechanics' liens, there was no means provided for landowners to challenge a lien. It might, therefore, have been arguable that the lien statute denied them due process. However, the statute was amended to add &sect; 34-28-17.1 two months before the trial justice held the pre-amendment law unconstitutional, and the amended statute was to apply to all pending actions. Therefore, the trial court erred in assessing the constitutionality of the wrong version of the statute. The same day it decided the instant case, the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the amended statute. Therefore, summary judgment should not have been entered in favor of the landowners, who would have an opportunity to challenge the propriety of the lien under the amended statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties entered into a contract regarding materials and labor for water and sewer lines. Later, the claimant filed a petition to enforce its mechanic's lien, and it recorded a notice of lis pendens. Thereafter, the owners filed a motion to dismiss the lien based on the fact the Rhode Island Mechanics' Lien Law violated due process. The superior court agreed, and the claimant sought review. In vacating, the court determined that it was required to review the amended version of the law in R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 34-28-17.1 because it had a retroactive effect. Next, the court held that &sect; 34-28-17.1 did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment or R.I. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2 after giving consideration to the three prongs of the Matthews-Doehr balancing test. Despite the lack of a showing of extraordinary circumstances and ex parte judicial review of the affidavit, the procedural safeguards that the statute employed, primarily the prompt post-deprivation hearing, limited the risk of erroneous deprivation. Tipping the scales in favor of constitutionality was the combination of the claimant's statutory preexisting interest in the property and the availability of a prompt post-deprivation hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, a father and a mother (jointly, parents), appealed a judgment by the Providence County Family Court (Rhode Island) that terminated their parental rights to their adopted children; the parents claimed that the Family Court did not make a specific finding of unfitness, that their rights against self-incrimination and due process were infringed upon, and that no reasonable attempts at reunification were made.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After two former foster children alleged that the father had sexually abused them, a court order permitted the mother to reside with and provide care for the children at a friend's home while the father occupied the family domicile. However, the mother violated the court order by allowing the father to see the children. The parents admitted that they neglected the children. Consequently, the Department of Children, Youth, and Families developed a case plan aimed at reuniting the parents with the children. However, the parents refused to sign the case plan or engage in any services aimed at reunification even after the father was acquitted of all criminal charges. The state supreme court found that the Family Court made a specific finding of unfitness, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 15-7-7(a)(3), (4) (1956), based on the parents refusal to engage in case planning. There was sufficient evidence of reunification services being offered to the parents. The Family Court did not infringe upon the parents' rights against self-incrimination or due process; rather, their own conduct undermined the possibility of seeing their children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Tax Assessor and the Tax Collector for the City of Providence (City), appealed the judgment of the Superior Court, Providence County (Rhode Island), which, on plaintiff taxpayers' action for mandamus, ordered the City to issue municipal lien certificates free and clear of any illegal tax, to refund any overpayment of property taxes, to issue new tax bills based on the last property valuation, and to provide an accounting.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A revitalization effort within Providence involved condemnation of property. The landowner of some condemned parcels filed suit and was awarded condemnation damages of $ 110 per square foot. The City attempted to recoup the condemnation judgment through a retroactive tax based on the $ 110 condemnation value of the landowner's property. It also reassessed the taxpayers' properties at the $ 110 rate. In the case involving the landowner, the trial court found the tax reassessments to be illegal, it required the City to expunge the reassessments, and it permanently enjoined the City from collecting taxes on the reassessments. In the instant case, the trial court found that the order in the landowner's case applied to the taxpayers. The City argued that the trial court's decision in the landowner's case did not place a defined ministerial duty upon the City to issue municipal clean lien certificates to the taxpayers. The trial court's decision unmistakably declared the tax reassessment scheme illegal for all properties that were reassessed in the revitalization area. Thus, the trial court's order imposed a mandatory duty upon the City to remove the illegal tax reassessment scheme.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. The record was remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws &sect; 11-41-1 (1956). He raised many issues, including several relating to the trial court's refusal to allow expert testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There were several eyewitnesses when defendant held up and shot the pregnant victim at a bank night deposit, so much of his appeal focused on their identifications. The high court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's exclusion of proposed expert testimony on post-traumatic stress, since the trial court had adequately cautioned the jury, on polygraph results, which were inadmissible in Rhode Island, or on genetic testing, the need for which had not been adequately supported. Destruction or loss of a bank surveillance videotape was not grounds for dismissal where there was no showing that the tape would have been exculpatory or that police officers had acted in bad faith. Since an unusual test of jurors' time perceptions was not improper closing argument, the trial court had not improperly commented on the evidence in attempting to clarify the purpose of the test. An argument that defendant had been improperly detained in Massachusetts was precluded under collateral estoppel principles by earlier decisions involving defendant. The State's failure to provide notice of its intent to invoke habitual offender sentencing mandated vacation of one extra sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in all respects except for the sentence imposed under the habitual offender statute, which it vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenants brought an action against defendants, alleging retaliation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, abuse of process, and malicious prosecution. The tenants alleged that their action arose from defendants' wrongful and retaliatory prosecution of civil and criminal complaints filed against them. The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court found that, not only did the tenants fail to raise retaliatory conduct as a defense to defendants' eviction complaint, the tenants resolved the eviction complaint by means of a stipulation. The tenants had no claim that the successful prosecution of the eviction complaint created any liability for damages. The court further found that the tenants did not allege, much less set forth, facts that even approached extreme and outrageous conduct. Finally, the court found that the tenants failed to demonstrate either abuse of process or malicious prosecution on the part of defendants. Because the eviction action against the tenants terminated successfully for the apartment complex, it could not serve as the predicate for a malicious prosecution action.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court, Newport County (Rhode Island) had already entered a judgment in favor of plaintiff neighbors, who had brought suit against the possessor seeking a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and to quiet title after the possessor disputed the neighbors' ownership and claimed title by adverse possession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case involved almost 10 years of litigation between the parties. A second nonjury trial had been ordered wherein the trial court determined that the possessor's activity on the land at issue failed to satisfy the elements for a claim of adverse possession as required by R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 34-7-1 (1956), in that it was determined that the possessor fell short of establishing that she openly and notoriously possessed the property that the neighbors owned because the possessor's efforts to clear the land and mow the grass were not visible to the neighbors due to a dense overgrowth of bullbriars and other mature vegetation between the properties. The court held, however, that the trial court erred by misconstruing the doctrine of open and notorious and by concluding that the possessor did not posses the property in an open and notorious way. The court noted that the neighbors were charged with knowledge of the possessor's adverse use even though her activities were obscured by dense vegetative barriers. The court held that the possessor was acting under a claim of right, as would an owner of comparable land, by mowing, maintaining the vegetation, and maintaining the fencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for entry of a judgment in favor of the possessor on her counterclaim for adverse possession.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town sent the officer to a training academy in Providence, Rhode Island, after he was unable to successfully complete a swimming component at the State's municipal academy. The Commission warned the town that the action would not make the officer eligible for continued employment with the town and threatened legal action. In their lawsuit, plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Commission served as the governing authority over municipal police training and that all probationary officers, except those hired in Providence, were required to attend the State's municipal police academy. On appeal, the court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs. Interpreting the language of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42.28.2, the court held that (1) all municipal police departments other than Providence were required to send their probationary officers to the municipal academy before they could be eligible for certification for permanent employment and (2) agreements between municipalities to send police recruits to any training facility other than the municipal academy had to receive Commission approval before the agreement was ratified and the candidate was trained.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws &sect; 20-6-30 (1956), which prohibited the use of self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) methods to gather shellfish from four named, coastal saltwater ponds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 20-6-30 was enacted after private citizens complained that commercial SCUBA fishing in the ponds was depleting the shellfish supply and interfering with boating activities. The fishermen argued that the statute violated R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 17's guarantee of fishery rights to all citizens as well as their substantive due process and equal protection rights. The high court held that the trial court had misinterpreted &sect; 17, in that it actually obligated the legislature to act to protect the rights of all Rhode Islanders, not just commercial fishermen. Since the legislation did not infringe any right entitled to heightened protection, the high court applied a minimal level of scrutiny, and found that the challenged restrictions, which applied to recreational as well as commercial fishermen, reasonably related to the proper legislative goal of preserving fisheries for the use of all.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the grant of summary judgment and remanded the matter with directions to enter judgment in favor of the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court, Providence County (Rhode Island), that granted petitioner inmate post-conviction relief, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 10-9.1-1 (1956), from a sentence imposed after his conviction on plea of nolo contendere of armed robbery and related offenses. He had challenged the sentence as unconstitutionally disproportionate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of his arrest after an armed robbery, the inmate faced potential three strikes sentencing. He therefore pled nolo contendere in exchange for a relatively long sentence that was nonetheless shorter than the one he could have received, and it was upheld as not manifestly excessive on direct review. The inmate then sought post-conviction relief on grounds that his sentence violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII and R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The high court, in applying both provisions, which it treated as identical, adopted the narrow articulation of non-capital punishment proportionality announced in the Eighth Amendment Ewing case. That case directed courts to weigh sentencing factors normally considered by courts and then determine whether the punishment was grossly disproportionate to the crime, without necessarily surveying sentences imposed in other cases. The fact that the sentence was bargained for under a constitutionally proper plea agreement was also weighed. Not only did the high court find the sentence not unconstitutional, but it also held that the lower court had had erred in granting relief on the same grounds raised in the inmate's direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment, vacated the reduction in sentence, reinstated the original plea agreement with its agreed-upon sentence, and remanded the matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant commercial property owner sought review of the grant of summary judgment by the Superior Court, Providence (Rhode Island) in favor of appellee tax assessor in regard to a municipal tax assessment. The property owner argued, inter alia, that although it had not signed or notarized the account for the challenged tax assessment, it substantially complied with the requirements of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-5-16 (1956).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner purchased property for $ 4.2 million. For the tax assessment in question, the city tax assessor's office assessed the property at $ 11,684,200. The property owner sought judicial review of the city's tax assessments of its city property pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-5-26 (1956). The appellate court held that pursuant to &sect; 44-5-26(c), merely alleging that the municipality assessed the property at a value in excess of the value at which it was assessed on the last preceding assessment day was insufficient for the taxpayer to qualify under one of the statutory exceptions that relieved the taxpayer from &sect; 44-5-26(a)'s &quot;no remedy&quot; sanction for failing to file a proper account. Since the property owner failed to file a signed and notarized account valuing the commercial real estate it owned in the city for the tax assessment in question pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-5-16 (1956), it was not entitled to invoke the jurisdiction of the superior court to remedy the city's alleged overassessment of its property. Because the property owner failed to satisfy the statutory requirements, the superior court could not afford it relief under &sect; 44-5-16.</SPAN></P>

Defendant corporation was named in the petition, but did not defend. A final decree was entered. The corporation moved to vacate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation purchased the property at a foreclosure sale. Its foreclosure deed was recorded 83 days before the tax sale. In moving to vacate the final decree, the corporation contended that the original tax sale was void for want of notice. In denying the corporation's motion, the trial justice found that the corporation had not previously challenged the validity of the tax sale. It failed to respond to the partnership's petition to foreclose, or to assert its rights as a fee owner within the statutory time constraints. The appellate court found that the corporation was entitled to notice of the tax sale because at the time of the sale, the controlling statute, former R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-9-11, had not been amended. A subsequent amendment to the statute was not retroactively controlling in the instant appeal. However, the corporation was bound by the mandates governing foreclosure petitions. Despite receiving actual notice of the petition, the corporation utterly failed to protect its interest or assert its rights, as required under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-9-31. Any subsequent claims by the corporation were forever barred under &sect; 44-9-31 and R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-9-30.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a heated dispute outside of a bar and fired a sawed-off shotgun, injuring a couple of people. The trial court denied dismissal of the charges, finding that the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 13, ch. 13 (1956), was not violated because the delay past the 180-day period was due to defendant's discharge of his attorney and his refusal to return to the jurisdiction. Denial of his motion to suppress was proper because his arrest was outside of the dwelling and, even assuming there was a constructive entry by police, exigent circumstances justified the arrest. The search of the apartments was conducted by a warrant which was validly based on probable cause, and further, there was no right of privacy in the vacant apartments, wherein the gun was found hidden in the ceiling. Admission of a firearms expert's testimony was proper, and exclusion of witnesses' prior convictions was within the trial court's discretion because they were &quot;stale&quot; and prejudicial. Denial of defendant's motion for mistrial was proper because he was not denied a fundamentally fair trial, and his cross-examination was not unconstitutionally limited.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion to withdraw. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel by denying his counsel's motion to withdraw. The supreme court found no abuse of discretion since, inter alia, the purported reason for the motion was a disagreement over trial strategy and there had been ample communication between counsel and defendant. Defendant also argued that the amendment of the information, correcting a statutory cite from the misdemeanor subsection to the felony subsection, added a different offense that substantially prejudiced him. The supreme court found no error, noting that defendant had been notified that the State would seek an enhanced prison term only available in the prosecution of a felony. As for the habitual offender amendment, the supreme court found no error since defendant was given a complete list of his prior convictions during discovery. Finally, the supreme court found no merit to defendant's argument that suspended sentences did not qualify as predicate offenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was violent and took medication to control himself, killed his fiance by choking her, beating her, and then running over her. Defendant was found guilty in a jury-waived trial of domestic murder and sentencing was based upon a finding beyond a reasonable doubt of an aggravating factor pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-23-2(b)(4) (1956). There was authority to impose a life sentence, even though the indictment did not allege a violation of &sect; 11-23-2, because the attorney general's notice of his intention to seek life imprisonment pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 12-19.2-1 et seq. (1956) satisfied due process. The court found that the trial judge's determination was sufficient for a finding of aggravation. The court found that the trial judge's findings that defendant was not suffering from diminished capacity and that he was not intoxicated at the time of the murder were supported by the evidence. Defendant's statements to police while he was threatening to jump from a bridge and to medical personnel in the hospital were not during custody and there was no cause to suppress them.

His motion for a new trial was denied. He was sentenced to 30 years plus 20 years for being a habitual offender.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the habitual criminal statute was unconstitutional because it violated the ban on double jeopardy contained in U.S. Const. amend.

In addition, the court noted that it had recently affirmed the constitutionality of the statute. Defendant also argued that the trial justice abused his discretion in failing to take into account defendant's cooperation with law enforcement authorities. The supreme court concluded that the superior court did not abuse its discretion since defendant's alleged cooperation was of no benefit to the prosecution after he refused to testify. Finally, defendant argued that this sentence was excessive in comparison to his codefendant who pled nolo contendere and was sentenced to 10 years. In affirming defendant's sentence, the supreme court noted, inter alia, that the trial justice established the rationale for the long sentence and distinguished it from the sentence given to codefendant, whose record was not comparable to defendant's. Thus, the supreme court found no abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ratepayer sued appellee town, requesting a declaratory judgment that 1999 R.I. Pub. Laws 318, &sect; 1, which authorized towns to impose certain sewer charges, was unconstitutional, that the town's 1999-2000 sewer budget was void, and seeking a permanent injunction to prevent the town from collecting sewer fees based on the 1999-2000 budget. The Superior Court, Newport County, Rhode Island, denied relief, and the ratepayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an appellate case held that the town lacked the authority to include charges for debt service and capital costs in its sewer bills, the town lobbied for corrective legislation, and the general assembly obliged. 1999 R.I. Pub. Laws 318, &sect; 1, gave a town the option of including assessments for these cost in its sewer charges, or of paying for them through general taxation. The town's council adopted the latter course. The ratepayer argued that &sect; 1 violated R.I. Const. art. 13, &sect; 4, which required that specific legislation affecting a particular home-rule community be approved by a majority of the town's electors. The appellate court disagreed. The law was enacted, not under &sect; 4 but under R.I. Const. art. 13, &sect; 5, and was a proper exercise of the legislature's power over municipal taxation and borrowing. The sewer assessment was not a tax, and thus the 5.5 percent cap imposed on municipal taxes by R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-5-2(c) was inapplicable. Section 1, did not violate equal protection under the state or federal constitutions, and was not an unconstitutional delegation of power under R.I. Const. art. 6, &sect;&sect; 1 or 2.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the father of two children. He was ordered to pay $ 147 per week in child support. His parental rights were terminated by the family court with his consent. At the time of the parental rights termination, he had accrued at least $ 7,660 in child support arrearage. The State accused him of violating R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-2-1.1 (1956) by accruing a child support arrearage of more than $ 75,000. He filed a motion to dismiss the information, claiming that his obligation to pay child support ended once his parental rights had been terminated, at which point he owed far less than the $ 30,000 required for prosecution under &sect; 11-2-1.1. The reviewing court found that under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 15-7-7(a) (1956) termination of parental rights did not terminate parental obligations. Because the trial court improperly found that the amount of defendant's child support obligation was to be determined from the date that his parental rights were terminated, the matter was remanded to the trial court to determine whether there was probable cause that defendant violated R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-2-1.1(b)(1) (1956).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of molesting his granddaughter in two incidents that allegedly occurred on the same day. The victim was so young that the date could not be pinpointed except within a period of years, but the trial justice that found the facts found the victim credible and defendant not credible. The high court reviewed the trial court's fact findings with deference, and found the evidence sufficient to support defendant's conviction. It was clear that the trial court found insufficient proof of penetration, but sufficient proof of sexual contact, despite defendant's claims of innocence, to support his conviction not of first-degree, but of second-degree molestation. Defendant also challenged the constitutionality of the registration and notification statute that would eventually apply to him, but the high court held that he had waived the constitutionality issues by failing to raise them in the trial court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case concerned the delivery of a package from Thailand, addressed to what the police decided was defendants' address. The package was intercepted at an airport and found to contain a large amount of heroin. Defendants were arrested after picking up the package from a post office. One of the defendant's made incriminating statements after being confronted by the police. The appellate court held the statements were made absent police interrogation and voluntarily after his arrest. Thus, there was no abuse of discretion by admitting them as they were relevant to determine defendants' knowledge of the contents of the package. The trial court accurately and adequately performed the requisite review and did so carefully and with sufficient reasoning for denying the motion for a new trial. There was sufficient evidence to support a finding that defendants had knowledge of the package's contents.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that there was no evidence of any prosecutorial misconduct or prejudice to defendant in bringing the additional charges. The State informed defendant at the time of the plea bargain negotiations of its intention to bring a two-count information against defendant if he failed to plead guilty. The State's reasons for bringing the additional charges were not based on improper considerations, such as race or religion. A trial preparation worksheet clearly showed that the State had considered the more serious charge in the initial stages of the prosecution. The prosecutor correctly used her discretion in deciding which charges to file against defendant. The appellate court questioned the State's action in holding defendant in jail for three weeks after failing to notify his attorney of the new information, and cautioned against such practice, absent justification.</SPAN></P>

The trial court erroneously instructed the jury that defendant's intent need not have existed when he initiated the telephone call, but rather, could have been formed after he initiated the call. Defendant's intent had to exist when the call was initiated. In determining whether such intent existed at that time, the jury could draw reasonable inferences from the nature and contents of the entire call.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a budget crisis, Rhode Island abolished compensation for members of administrative boards, but reinstated a right to compensation, for a limited period, as to board members who performed adjudicatory functions. Years later, several former members of one commission sought to recover unpaid compensation. The high court held that although the members' right to compensation was not constitutionally guaranteed, the state had waived sovereign immunity as to the period covered by the legislation reinstating a right to payment. Since the claim was unlike anything covered by a specific statute of limitations, the 10-year catchall statute of limitations applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was represented by several attorneys in the course of his prosecution and conviction on murder charges, and he subsequently sued several of them. The attorney in the instant case represented the inmate only briefly, at a suppression hearing. The high court, after noting that the attorney's motion to dismiss had become a summary judgment motion when he attached extraneous materials to it, agreed that the inmate's claims were insufficient. A court-appointed attorney or public defender did not act under color of state law for purposes of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 liability. Furthermore, the inmate could only recover money damages, which he was in fact seeking, if his conviction had been reversed, expunged, or invalidated, which was not the inmate's situation. Finally, not only was there no showing of negligent representation in fact, but the inmate failed to allege that the attorney's purported negligence caused his conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company bought a piece of property from a third party, believing that there was a nonconforming earth removal use on the property. When the company attempted to renew its gravel bank license, the town asked the company to show cause why it should not issue a cease and desist order or otherwise review, limit, or condition the company's current operations. The company filed a petition for a declaratory judgment and for injunctive relief and the town filed a counterclaim, asserting that the company's use of the property violated various town ordinances and challenging the existence and validity of the company's alleged nonconforming use of the property. Because the issue raised by the town challenging the existence of the alleged nonconforming use constituted a material issue of fact, the trial court motion hearing justice was precluded from acting upon and deciding the parties' respective cross-motions for summary judgment. The proper resolution of that material fact was essential to support the validity of the trial court's final judgment. Its absence compelled the appellate court to vacate the final judgment order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The final judgment entered in the case was vacated and the matter was remanded to the trial court for a new trial to determine whether the alleged nonconforming use ever existed.</SPAN></P>

Laws &sect; 11-35-21(a)(1), (c)(3) (1994 Reenactment), and sentencing him to a five-year suspended sentence with a concurrent probationary term. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's indictment, and ultimate conviction, arose from his asking his fraternity brother to videotape his intimate relations with the victim. On appeal, the state supreme court held, first, that the videotape recorder, was an &quot;interception device&quot; under Rhode Island law. Second, the trial judge's failure to read to the jury the statutory definitions of &quot;intercept&quot; and &quot;intercepting device&quot; was not reversible error. Third, &quot;willfully,&quot; in the context of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-35-21(a)(1) (1994 Reenactment) meant to act voluntarily and intentionally, and not because of a mistake or accident or other innocent reason. Fourth, the trial judge's refusal to give an instruction distinguishing between committing a tort and acting for the purpose of committing a tort was not reversible error. Fifth, the videotape was properly admitted into evidence because its probative value was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Sixth, the jury charge, read as a whole, was sufficient to dispel any possible misunderstanding arising from the trial judge's reasonable doubt definition. Lastly, defendant had a full and fair opportunity to argue his theory of defense.</SPAN></P>

The high court held that the placing of special limitations on landlords in the special situation of mobile homes was justified by legislative findings of tenant vulnerability.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, Director of the Department of Environmental Management and the Attorney General, filed suit against defendant corporation, claiming that the State of Rhode Island had acquired an easement to a private lake and seeking an injunction prohibiting corporation from interfering with that use. After a bench trial, the Superior Court, Providence County (Rhode Island) entered judgment for the corporation, and the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1964, the State purchased a lot abutting a private lake owned by a corporation. In 1965, the State constructed a boat ramp on the lot to give members of the public access to the lake. The ramp extended into the lake and was partially submerged at ordinary high water levels. Evidence showed the State allowed members of the public to use the boat ramp and that the corporation did not complain about that use until 1997 when it posted a &quot;No trespassing&quot; sign near the ramp. The state supreme court held that (1) the State was not limited to using its power of eminent domain to acquire property; (2) the law permitted the State to acquire an easement by prescription or title by adverse possession over property that was privately owned; and (3) because the State's construction of the boat ramp and its subsequent maintenance of that structure during uninterrupted use by the public over the next 32 years was open, actual, notorious, hostile, adverse, and continuous, the State acquired a portion of the lake bottom by adverse possession and also acquired a prescriptive easement, on behalf of the public, to use the ramp for purposes of obtaining access to the lake.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court vacated the trial court's judgment and it remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to enter judgment for the State.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent juvenile was charged with sexual and domestic assault. Juvenile requested a jury trial on the basis that he would be required to register as a sexual offender beyond the age of majority if found delinquent on the sexual assault charges. The State objected, claiming juvenile was not entitled to jury trial. The Family Court (Rhode Island) certified three questions to the state supreme court with regard to the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The questions asked (1) whether the Sexual Offender Registration and Community Notification Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 11, ch. 37.1 (1956), (the Act) was constitutional as applied to juveniles; (2) whether juveniles accused of sexual offenses were entitled to a jury trial if the Act was constitutional; and (3) whether a juvenile had the right to a jury trial, if he/she was subjected to registration as a sex offender past his/her 21st birthday. The constitutionality of the Act was not raised in the family court. The state supreme court held that the failure to bring the constitutionality issue before the family court for judicial determination was fatal to the first certified question. The state supreme court further held that the second and third certified questions were not so obscure or enigmatic as to preclude their successful resolution by the family court justice in the first instance, and that, in light of the context of the case, the family court justice had the obligation to deal first with the issues presented in the certified questions in order to provide the state supreme court with a complete record for appeal, including the family court justice's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court declined to respond to the certified questions and remanded the case to the family court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of stalking in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-59-2 (1956) (1996 version), arguing insufficiency of evidence, admissibility of prior offense to prove an element of the offense, constitutionality of the statute, and whether it was prejudicial to admit records of prior convictions as fingerprint evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had previously been convicted of stalking the victim (victim) under the 1992 version of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-59-2 (1956), a statute later ruled unconstitutional, and amended in 1996 and thereafter. He resumed contacts with victim, and was charged under the 1996 version. The court found the evidence sufficient to survive defendant's motion for acquittal. In determining whether victim was reasonably put in apprehension, the jury properly considered all the circumstances, including defendant's prior offenses against victim. Defendant was convicted of the offense as articulated in the 1996 version, which was amended to eliminate constitutional infirmities. Although he challenged the constitutionality of the 1996 version on appeal, he waived review by failing to raise the challenge in the trial court. Finally, the trial court could have admitted fingerprint samples less prejudicial than defendant's previous criminal records, but the error was not reversible because jurors already knew about his past.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed defendant's appeal. The evidence was sufficient, and defendant's prior offenses were admissible to prove victim's state of mind. Defendant waived review of his belated constitutional challenges to the amended statute. Fingerprint evidence was unnecessarily prejudicial, but defendant failed to show harm because jurors knew of prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the judgment of the Superior Court of Providence (Rhode Island), in plaintiffs' medical malpractice action and remanded for a new trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's daughter suffered nerve damage as a result of surgery. Plaintiff was never warned of any risks of the surgery other than bleeding and infection. Defendant contended the trial court committed reversible error in refusing to allow counsel to question plaintiff about whether she would have consented to surgery if she had been informed of all the risks. The trial court sustained several objections to these questions since they assumed facts not in evidence and defendant never had any significant conversation with plaintiff about risks and medical alternatives in respect to the accessory nerve. The trial court permitted several questions on informed consent. Additionally the trial court allowed a vigorous and long cross-examination of plaintiff mother, and committed no abuse of discretion in excluding a number of persistent and repetitious questions. The trial court erred in permitting the use of certain portions of a journal, when no expert witness had authenticated the materials as reliable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Jury could have found from evidence that plaintiff mother did not have opportunity to evaluate risks. Use of unauthenticated medical treatises did not constitute prejudicial error. Since attorney general was not served with copy of proceeding and was not given an opportunity to be heard, appellate court could not review constitutionality of statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions of sexual assault and burglary, in Kent County Superior Court (Rhode Island), arguing that he could not commit burglary within his relatives' house as a matter of law and that the alleged victim consented to sexual contact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Knowing that his half-brother's girlfriend, victim, was highly intoxicated, defendant entered his stepmother's house and his half-brother's room when no one but victim was home, and initiated sexual relations. The court upheld his convictions of burglary and sexual assault, holding that even though defendant possibly had permission to enter the larger house, Rhode Island's concept of common law burglary included entering a bedroom that one had no permission to enter as a matter of law. The hearsay evidence challenged by defendant was admissible to show state of mind, and evidence of his stepmother's low opinion of him was admissible to show intent. Finally, the evidence was sufficient to justify a finding that victim was too intoxicated to consent and there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court's determination that she was too drunk to consent with an ulterior motive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied and dismissed appeal and affirmed convictions, because a reasonable juror could have found guilt from evidence, it was possible to commit burglary by entering a particular room without permission, and there was no abuse of discretion in finding victim was too intoxicated to consent for any reason.</SPAN></P>

The family court found defendant guilty of failure to pay child support and sentenced defendant to five years' imprisonment, with three years to serve and two years suspended with probation. On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, that: (1) the State lacked probable cause to charge him under &sect; 11-2-1.1; (2) the family court erred in limiting cross-examination; and (3) &sect; 11-2-1.1, as applied to him, was unconstitutional. The supreme court affirmed the judgment, concluding there was sufficient evidence to establish that probable cause existed to charge defendant under &sect; 11-2-1.1, without including interest in meeting the statutory threshold. Further, the supreme court found the family court did not abuse its discretion in limiting cross-examination. Finally, the supreme court concluded the application of &sect; 11-2-1.1, as applied to defendant, did not render it an invalid ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court denied and dismissed defendant's appeal, affirmed the judgment, and remanded the papers to the family court, because, although defendant claimed he did not have any current obligation to pay child support at the time of his arrest, the supreme court found that a plain reading of the statutory language encompassed both current child support installments and court-ordered payments for past arrearage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court, Kent County (Rhode Island) certified three questions to the court to determine whether R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 31-27-2(c) should have been interpreted to preclude, for violations of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 31-27-2.2, driving under the influence, death resulting, the admission at trial of the results of breath, blood, or urine tests when the samples were seized without the defendant's consent, but pursuant to a search warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that admission of results of breathalyzer, blood, or urine tests at trial was precluded when the samples were seized without defendant's consent. A statute precluded law enforcement from obtaining a warrant to seize the blood when defendant withheld consent. The statutory language &quot;none shall be given&quot; was plain and unambiguous and became operative after the suspect refused a chemical test, and that upon such a refusal, a test should not be given, with or without a warrant, to &quot;any person who operated a motor vehicle within this state,&quot; pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 31-27-2.1(a). Such preclusion was not an unconstitutional limitation on the judicial authority to issue search warrants. The Superior Court was statutory in origin and derived its powers from statutes duly enacted by the legislature. This power could not be extended by judicial interpretation, nor by a policy adopted by the executive branch of state government. The scope of the Superior Court's warrant authority was delineated by the legislature and the court had no inherent power to issue a search warrant, but instead exercised only those powers that were conferred by statute.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff initiated a civil action for defamation against defendants, claiming that its construction and demolition recycling business and reputation had been destroyed by the publication of defendant neighbor's statements in the newspaper. The court found that defendant neighbor's statements were neither objectively sham, nor actionable in light of the immunity protection afforded those statements by virtue of the Limits on Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation (anti-SLAPP statute), R.I.

Initially, defendant biological mother agreed to allow plaintiff non-biological parent to have informal visits but later, refused to abide by the schedule. Plaintiff petitioned the Family Court, seeking to establish her de facto parental status and to obtain court-ordered visitation. Upon negotiating a compromise, the consent agreement was entered as an order. Subsequently, plaintiff sought contempt relief to enforce the order. Expressing doubts about its jurisdiction, the Family Court certified the questions to the appellate court. The Supreme Court of Rhode Island remanded, holding that the Family Court did have jurisdiction to determine the existence of a mother and child relationship between the non-biological parent and the child and, as such, could enforce the parties' written agreement to allow plaintiff to have visitation.</SPAN></P>

The state legislature, which was given the authority to operate lotteries by the state constitution, could delegate some of its authority to defendant to carry out its constitutional duties. The functions that had been delegated were given to defendant with specific and detailed guidelines.

Gen. Laws &sect; 12-28-5 (1956), a victim's rights statute that provided for the entry of a civil judgment against a defendant upon final conviction of a felony after a trial by jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of sexually assaulting plaintiff child, plaintiffs filed a civil suit seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief against defendant. Pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 12-28-5 (1956), plaintiffs moved for automatic civil judgment on the issue of liability. Defendant filed objections, arguing that the statute was plaintiffs' exclusive remedy, precluding plaintiffs' claim for punitive damages and injunctive relief, and that the statute was unconstitutional. The Attorney General intervened, and asked the court to certify the questions to the state supreme court. The trial court did so. The supreme court held that the statute did not create an exclusive remedy, that it was mandatory unless the crime victim asked the court not to enter judgment. Further, considering the statute's constitutionality generally and as applied, the statute did not deprive defendant of due process or violate his right against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of a stolen motor vehicle in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 31-9-2 (1956), and he received an enhanced sentence as an habitual criminal pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 12-19-21 (1956). The trial court admitted evidence of a prison conversation between defendant and a prosecution witness and that defendant sold the stolen vehicle for cash and a quantity of cocaine. The witness later recanted. On appeal, the court held that R.I. R. Evid. 404(b) did not prohibit evidence relevant to the proof of the crime, even if the evidence demonstrated an uncharged crime or bad act. Therefore, the cocaine evidence and the prison conversation were admissible. The trial judge did not limit the use of the prosecution's witness's prior inconsistent statements to credibility determinations. Therefore, under R.I. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(A), the prior inconsistent statements may have been used as substantive evidence of those matters asserted. An instruction concerning the substantive use of prior inconsistent statements was not required, and there was no error in declining the defendant's proffered instruction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's appeal was denied and dismissed, and the judgment of conviction and sentence imposed under the habitual criminal statute were affirmed because the jury was properly instructed with regard to the State's witness's prior inconsistent statements and because an habitual offender sentence enhancement did not violate double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

Respondent denied the claim and, while on appeal, the statute was repealed. The court found the repeal barred petitioners from recovering on their claims for reimbursement. Respondent had never accepted liability for the claims where there were no preexisting agreements between petitioners and respondent. Although petitioners expected reimbursement from the fund, their claims were mere &quot;floating expectancies&quot; that could be eliminated at anytime. The statute did not create rights where there was no contractual or bargained-for-exchange language. Thus, the statute did not create a private and enforceable contract right with the state.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff nightclub appealed the dismissal of its action to invalidate defendant town's ordinance prohibiting nude-barroom dancing. The court affirmed finding that the ordinance constituted a valid exercise of the defendant town's power to impose reasonable conditions upon the granting of local liquor licenses and did not unconstitutionally abridge plaintiff's free-speech rights. Plaintiffs' challenge to the validity of the former ordinance was rendered moot by defendant's enactment of a subsequent ordinance under its authority to condition the issuance of liquor licenses granted to it by the legislature. This authority was not preempted by state law. Plaintiff failed to establish the conditions precedent for applying the doctrine of equitable estoppel. The ordinance did not constitute a content-based regulation, but was, rather, a content-neutral regulation to protect a substantial government interest in preventing the adverse consequences of mixing alcohol consumption with nude dancing and to promote societal order and morality in the town.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws &sect; 33-23-1 (1956) when he brought the appeals, and thus, the proceedings moved well beyond the point where R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 81(a)(1) would make the Rhode Island Rules of Civil Procedure inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

IX, &sect; 14, because the legislature's prior passage, and the Governor's subsequent approval, of authorizing legislation ratified it; [3]-Defendants violated the Open Meetings Act (Act) because R.I.

The members had implied-in-fact contractual rights to their pension benefits and to a cost of living adjustment because these rights were fully vested and no longer subject to divestment in that the members, as retirees, had fully and honorably completed their service; [2]-Because a contractual relationship existed, the Takings Clause, Due Process Clause, and Contract Clause claims survived.</SPAN></P>

Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(2). Defendant, by voluntarily entering his plea, waived any argument regarding the alleged lack of constitutional authority of the special magistrate; [2]-The court drew the reasonable inference that the advice defendant received leading to his plea was both competent and capable; [3]-Defendant failed to appeal his judgment of conviction or file a motion to withdraw his plea.</SPAN></P>
