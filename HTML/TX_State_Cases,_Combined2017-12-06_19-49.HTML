<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient challenged a decision from the 359th District Court, Montgomery County, Texas, which determined that he was a sexually violent predator (SVP) under the Texas Sexually Violent Predator Act, Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 841.001-841.150 (2003 &amp; Supp. 2007), and ordered him civilly committed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was convicted of murder in 1982. The State later filed a petition to commit him under the Act, which alleged that he had committed a sexually motivated murder and a burglary with intent to commit rape. He was committed as a SVP, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court held that the Act was not unconstitutional due to being punitive in nature. The Act limited involuntary civil commitments to persons suffering from a volitional impairment that rendered them dangerous beyond their control. Further, the appellate court declined to infer &quot;retribution&quot; from &quot;example&quot; testimony. There was no double jeopardy violation because the Act was not tantamount to punishment. The Act did not constitute a bill of attainder. The Act was not vague under the Fifth Amendment. One alleged error in the jury charge was not preserved for appellate review. It was reasonable for the trial court to submit the issues in a broad-form charge. Res judicata did not bar the State from showing that the murder was caused by sexually motivated conduct, and the establishment of a child safety zone was not limited to crimes against children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was an appeal from 45 cases that were under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.

The trial court dismissed the suits, however, holding Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code &sect; 71.051&nbsp;unconstitutional in its entirety and applied the common law doctrine of forum non conveniens. The court concluded the trial court erred in declaring the statute unconstitutional and then dismissing the cases based on the common law doctrine of forum non conveniens. The trial court erred because the Texas Supreme Court abolished the common law doctrine of forum non conveniens, and upheld the constitutionality of the amended Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty by a jury in the Criminal District Court No. 1 of Tarrant County (Texas) of aggravated sexual assault of a child under the age of 14 and indecency with a child under the age of 17. The jury assessed defendant's punishment at confinement for life for the aggravated sexual assault conviction and at 20 years for the indecency conviction. The trial court ordered the sentences to run consecutively. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the State improperly was allowed to commit the jurors by asking whether they could convict based solely on the testimony of a child if the testimony established the offense and was believed beyond a reasonable doubt. However, this line of questioning was proper because it could lead to answers giving rise to a valid challenge for cause. Defendant also argued that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting outcry evidence over his objections and that Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 38.072 was unconstitutional. The court held that because the complainant testified to the same facts as the outcry witness, admission of the outcry witness's testimony did not require reversal. Defendant failed to preserve his objection to the constitutionality of article 38.072 in the trial court. Additionally, defendant did not have standing to challenge the statute because it was not unconstitutionally applied to him: in his case, the child complainant testified and was subject to cross-examination. The sentences were within the statutory range, and stacking was permitted under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.08 (2006) and Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 3.03(b) (Supp. 2008).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed after a jury of the 283rd District Court of Dallas County, Texas, found him guilty of the offense of aggravated sexual assault of a child and sentenced him to life in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant attacked the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence, specifically attacking the sufficiency of the evidence to demonstrate that he came into contact with the victim's sexual organ. Defendant also argued that an instruction given to the jury under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07(4)(a), which made reference to good conduct time, was unconstitutional as applied to him, because he was not eligible to receive good conduct time credits on his sentence due to his conviction for aggravated sexual assault. The appellate court noted that a child did not need to testify in specific clinical terms or with the same clarity with which an adult's testimony could be characterized, and held that the evidence was both legally and factually sufficient, as the trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court also found that the jury instruction issue was waived, because it was inadequately briefed. The appellate court additionally noted that there was nothing to indicate that the instruction had an impact on the jury or that defendant did not receive a fair or impartial trial.</SPAN></P>

The State appealed, contending the judgment should have included interest on the arrearage that existed on the effective date of the interest statute, for a total judgment of no less than $ 21,392.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After entry of the parties' divorce decree, the child support obligor failed to pay any support. The State filed a notice of change of payee because the child began to receive public assistance and moved to reduce arrears to judgment. When a hearing was held, one issue was whether interest should apply to arrearages incurred before the effective date of the interest statute. The child support master recommended interest should be assessed only on payments coming due after September 1, 1991. The child support master ordered the State to submit a written order and judgment. The State submitted a proposed order, and the master signed it, approving the $ 9,089 amount. The State asserted the trial court misinterpreted the statute that provided for the imposition of interest on child support arrearage. On the day after the effective date of the interest statute, $ 13,000 in arrears was due and owing. It followed that the act applied to this amount, as well as to any unpaid payments accumulating thereafter. The amount of arrears owing on that date should have been included in the principal upon which interest accrued after the enactment date of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the County Court of Mcculloch County (Texas), which, under Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction entered against defendant for stalking, under Tex.

Defendant was convicted for stalking his ex-wife. Defendant did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence, but argued that the stalking statute was unconstitutionally vague. Specifically, the terms conduct and offense were not defined in the statute. The court reviewed the presumption of validity. The interpretation of the statute embraced conduct that every reasonable person would have known was unlawful. It was not solely the nature of defendant's conduct that established the criminal conduct, but his mental state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Intervenor Attorney General of Texas challenged a decision of the 34th District Court of El Paso County (Texas), which entered a permanent injunction against defendant property owners in favor of intervenor home buyer concerning his claim regarding Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect; 209.011, in connection with an original judicial foreclosure action brought by plaintiff homeowners' association against the owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association filed this action based on the owners' failure to pay assessments and administrative fees. The trial court ultimately ordered foreclosure of the property. The buyer purchased the property, then filed the instant claim challenging Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect; 209.011, which addressed redemption, as unconstitutional. The trial court ruled in favor of the buyer and found that application of the statute would have been unfair. On appeal, the court vacated the decision and dismissed the matter. The buyer filed his petition in intervention 183 days after the final judgment ordering judicial foreclosure of the property was rendered. The trial court judgment appealed from did not set aside the prior judgment, but permanently enjoined the owners from taking advantage of redemption provisions contained in &sect; 209.011. Following settled case law, the court concluded that the trial court erred when it considered the buyer's intervention, which was untimely under Tex. R. Civ. P. 60. The trial court thus lacked jurisdiction to enter the judgment granting a permanent injunction against the owners, and the judgment was void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the trial court's judgment in favor of the buyer and dismissed the case. The court did not disturb the trial court's judgment in the original action.</SPAN></P>

Defendant swallowed the bag, but a small amount of marijuana was recovered. After conviction, a juror, who served on defendant's case told defendant's attorney that jurors experimented by placing a plastic bag in their mouths to see if it was possible to breathe while chewing and swallowing it. The juror indicated that, after finding it was possible to do so, he changed his not guilty vote. Defendant was denied a new trial after the trial court found the juror's affidavit was inadmissible. Defendant appealed, arguing the trial court erred by excluding the juror's affidavit under Tex. R. Evid. 606(b), and because the same rule was unconstitutional. The appellate court held the information gathered by the jurors did not constitute an outside influence, as it did not come from a non-juror, thus it was not admissible. The appellate court concluded Tex. R. Evid. 606(b) was constitutional under both federal and state law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant entered a plea of guilty of possession with intent to deliver cocaine after the trial court denied his motion to suppress. The State argued that appellant waived all non-jurisdictional issues by entering an open plea of guilty.

Appellant's claim that Tex. Transp. Code &sect; 545.104(a) was unconstitutionally vague was rejected. The plain language of &sect; 545.104(a) required appellant to signal. There was a reasonable suspicion to justify the appellant's detention. The officers made the stop based upon the unsignalled lane change.

The appellate court found that defendant signed and dated the plea agreement containing a specific waiver to confrontation of witnesses on the issues of guilt and punishment. He stated in his acknowledgement that he read and understood the plea, his attorney explained the admonitions and warnings, and the statements were made voluntarily. Defendant waived his right to challenge the trial court's consideration of the victim-impact statement. At no time during his objections did defendant mention Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 56.03 or otherwise argue it was facially unconstitutional. Defendant did not raise a facial challenge to the constitutionality of article 56.03 under either the Due Process or Confrontation Clause in the trial court. He therefore had not preserved the issue for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A federal court had ordered petitioner's release from custody based on ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the indictment was not dismissed. Petitioner sought dismissal of the indictment pursuant to former Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 28.061. A magistrate court held that article 28.061 was unconstitutional. In an earlier appeal, the court held that the article was constitutional and therefore the court did not reach petitioner's argument that the law of the case, based on his former applications and appeals, did not allow the courts to consider the constitutionality of article 28.061. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that the statute was unconstitutional and remanded the case to the court for consideration of petitioner's law of the case argument. The court held that the law of the case doctrine did not bar the court's consideration of the constitutionality of article 28.061 because its constitutionality had not been addressed or decided in any prior decision. Because there was no prior appellate decision establishing the law of the case in petitioner's favor, the doctrine could not act to bar further prosecution of petitioner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of petitioner's application for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

The 145th District Court of Nacogdoches County, Texas, granted the State's motion to reopen its case.

The appellate found that defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of art. 36.02 was not properly before it. Defendant's contention that art. 36.02 was unconstitutional as applied to him could not be raised for the first time on appeal; further, his counsel's running objection did not assert the unconstitutional application of art. 36.02, and so did not preserve that contention for appellate review. Defendant's constitutional challenge to the procedural statute must also have first been raised at trial, even if he was contending it was unconstitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty in the 203rd District Court, Dallas County, Texas, to delivery of a controlled substance in a drug-free zone, Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.134(c) (Supp. 2004). A jury found him guilty and sentenced him to 40 years' confinement. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the drug-free zone provision was unconstitutional on its face. He asserted that the phrase &quot;minimum term of confinement&quot; was ambiguous because it did not specify whether the five-year increase was in addition to an increase for prior convictions under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.42 (2003). The court found no ambiguity. The plain meaning was that if an enumerated offense was committed within 1,000 feet of a school, the minimum term of confinement, whatever that minimum term might be, was increased by five years. At least one court had held that the five-year increase was properly added to the minimum term after enhancements were taken into account. The court held that the 1,000-foot drug-free zone imposed by Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.134(c) was not arbitrary or capricious because any drug-related activity in the vicinity of a school increased the likelihood that drugs would become accessible to the children who attended the school. Finally, because &sect; 481.134(c) did not create a separate offense, no culpable mental state was required beyond that contained in Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.112(c).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant was convicted under &sect; 33.021 after he engaged in sexually explicit conversation in an online chat room with an individual who indicated that she was 12 years old; the individual was actually 39 years old, and applicant, who was 54 years old, claimed that he knew the individual was an adult based on the information given in their conversations. Applicant did not pursue a direct appeal but filed the instant application for a writ of habeas corpus under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 11.072. The trial court did not address applicant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims, which were not pursued in the instant appeal, but found &sect; 33.021 to be constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. Because the constitutionality of the statute was not raised at trial or on direct appeal, the issue was forfeited under art. 11.072, &sect; 3. The challenge could not be addressed in the context of an ineffective assistance claim because that claim was not raised on appeal. An as-applied or a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the statute did not render the judgment of conviction void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father appealed the judgment of the 314th District Court, Harris County (Texas) that terminated his parental rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued, inter alia, that termination was improper because the children were not removed from him as the result of abuse or neglect on his part. The court of appeals disagreed. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 161.001(1)(O) did not require that the parent who failed to comply with a court order be the same parent whose abuse or neglect of the child warranted the child's removal. The State received a referral alleging neglectful supervision and physical neglect of the children by the mother. When officers arrived at the home at 2:15 p.m., they found the children home alone, cat feces on the mother's bed, a soiled mattress in the children's room, dirty dishes in the sink, and spoiled milk in the refrigerator. The children told the officers that their mother had left at 2:00 a.m., returned to leave doughnuts, and then left again. When questioned as to her whereabouts, the mother told an officer that she had gone to the store to purchase milk. However, the officer informed the case worker that there was a corner store that sold milk nearby, and that the mother had not been there. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to show that the children were removed for neglect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for theft based on his threats to file law suits against and his settlements with men who had affairs with defendant's wife.

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 1.07(a)(48) (Supp. 2008), because &sect; 31.03(b) specifically defined when the appropriation of property was &quot;unlawful&quot; in relation to the offense of theft; (2) defendant's use of Tex. R. Civ. P. 202 petitions in threatening to file a lawsuit could be criminal; (3) the theft statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad or vague; and (4) the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support the convictions. There was evidence that defendant created the false impression that, because of the affairs, he needed counseling and was unable to work, that the settlement would be used for a children's foundation, and that there were not other affairs.</SPAN></P>

In closing argument, defense counsel referred to the evidence of the brother's offense and sentence and asked for &quot;equal protection under our law.&quot; Counsel noted that the brother had admitted to the aggravated sexual assault, and stated, in part, that: &quot;the only difference is that he admitted his guilt to this charge and my client exercised his constitutional right, which each of us has, to a jury trial, and he has received that.&quot; In rebuttal, the prosecutor argued: &quot;defendant has never taken responsibility for his actions.&quot; The trial court overruled the defense objection that the prosecutor was commenting on defendant's failure to testify. As a response to the defense argument that sought to have the jury treat defendant the same as his brother despite his brother's guilty plea, the prosecutor's rebuttal was not improper.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that &quot;bodily injury&quot; in Tex. Penal Code Ann.  &sect; 22.01(b)(1) was not impermissibly vague because ordinary citizens as well as law-enforcement personnel could understand the common meanings of &quot;pain,&quot; &quot;illness,&quot; and &quot;impairment of physical condition.&quot; Appellant was capable of determining what behavior was prohibited and the officer was able to determine that he suffered pain as a result of appellant's actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the County Criminal Court of Appeals No. 2, Dallas County (Texas), defendant was convicted of criminal trespass in a regional transit agency's transfer center in violation of Tex. Pen. Code Ann. &sect; 30.05(a) (2007). Contending that the agency's criminal trespass policy violated his constitutional rights, defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Tex. Pen. Code Ann. &sect; 30.05(a) (2007), a person committed criminal trespass if the person entered or remained in a building or on property of another without effective consent and the person had notice that the entry was forbidden. It was the transit agency's policy to issue a criminal trespass warning to a person who was on the agency's property for purposes other than to utilize public transportation services. Under this policy, defendant was given a warning that banned him from the transfer station for one year; when he was again present at the station three days later with no intent to use the agency's services, an agency police officer arrested him. The appellate court noted that the unchallenged evidence--which established that at the time of the arrest, defendant was without effective consent to be at the station and had notice that his entry was forbidden--was sufficient to support his conviction under &sect; 30.05(a). Defendant did not explain or address how the alleged unconstitutionality of the agency's policy would affect the validity of his conviction, and he did not challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 30.05(a) itself on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.08 was unconstitutionally vague. The State requested that the appellate court modify the judgment to reflect the sentence as pronounced in open court. The evidence was factually sufficient to prove defendant committed the offense of indecent exposure. Although defendant denied committing the offense, the detective testified defendant did expose his penis to the detective with an intent to arouse. Defendant did not cite any authority to support his contention that the indecent exposure statute was unconstitutionally vague due to the use of the words offended or alarmed. The mere failure to define offended or alarmed did not make the statute unconstitutionally vague. In its cross-point, the State asserted that the trial court's judgment listed the period for community supervision as 24 months. However, the trial court pronounced sentence in open court and ordered community supervision for only 12 months. Accordingly, the appellate court modified the trial court's judgment to reflect the punishment included community supervision for 12 months.</SPAN></P>

The only issue addressed in September was punishment, and the only evidence was the presentence investigation report. The trial court did not err in not re-opening the plea proceedings in September to further admonish defendant. Defendant waived any complaint that the sex offender registration requirement included in the trial court's judgment constituted cruel and unusual punishment because he did not raise a contemporaneous objection. Defendant failed to raise his Tenth Amendment argument in the trial court. Defendant's trial counsel was not deficient. A copy of the presentence investigation report was included in the record.

As defendant admitted, experts testified that sexual abuse generally affected the mental or physical welfare of a child, and ample evidence established that the complainant had been abused. That evidence sufficiently demonstrated the potential harm required to convict defendant. Furthermore, even assuming that proof of actual harm was required, there was sufficient evidence in the record that the son's abuse actually harmed complainant's physical or mental welfare. The complainant testified that the son sexually assaulted her &quot;a lot of times&quot; and that she screamed during the abuse on at least one occasion, causing the son to hit her. She also testified that she bled twice from the abuse. A detective testified that the complainant told him she was talking to him because she was scared and wanted the abuse to stop.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the County Criminal Court at Law No. 6, Harris County, Texas, for illegally dumping waste matter with an aggregate weight of 500 pounds or more, with one enhancement. The trial court sentenced him to one year of probation and assessed a $ 2,500 fine. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant signed a statement admitting he illegally dumped the trash and was convicted. On appeal, he argued his conviction was void because he was tried under a statute that was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to him. Specifically, he contended because the statute at the time of his arrest did not require a culpable mental state, the statute was unconstitutional. Defendant further asserted his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the information as unconstitutional, and that the evidence was not factually sufficient to sustain his conviction. The appellate court initially noted defendant waived his constitutional arguments for failing to raise the issues in the trial court, but held a culpable mental state of at least recklessness was required for a violation of Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 365.012(a) (Vernon Supp. 2002), therefore it was not unconstitutional. The appellate court concluded although defendant's counsel should have filed a motion to quash the information, no prejudice was shown because the State could have merely amended the information, and that defendant's factual sufficiency challenge completely lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant firefighter challenged a decision from the 281st District Court in Harris County (Texas), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, a pension fund, its trustees, and a city, in an action involving a dispute over retirement benefits. After the court rendered a decision on appeal, both parties filed a motion for a rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The firefighter joined the Houston, Texas, Fire Department. He sought to purchase prior service credit under former Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6243e.2, &sect; 30 (current version at Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6243e.2(1), &sect; 16(a) (2003). After the request was denied, the firefighter filed claims against the city, the fund, and its trustees. The trial court granted a motion for summary judgment, and the firefighter appealed. When the court determined that the firefighter's claims were not ripe, both parties filed a motion for a rehearing. In granting the motion, the court determined that the fund had exclusive jurisdiction over the firefighter's claims. Therefore, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action. The only persons having a right of judicial review were those eligible for retirement under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6243e.2(1), &sect; 12(a) (2003). Further, the court rejected the firefighter's constitutional claims because he had no vested right in the pension fund, and the denial of the credit was rationally related to a legitimate state purpose. Finally, the city was immune from suit because the actions complained of were governmental functions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After granting the firefighter's motion for a rehearing, the court modified the judgment to dismiss the claims without prejudice based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

The court concluded that the father's arguments were theoretical, and that the father failed to show any harm by the application of the statute. The father did not identify any issues that he had been deprived of pursuing due to the statutory mandate of a statement of points. The father did not show how the statute infringed on the court's ability to review the issues raised. Because the father did not show how the statute operated to deprive him of the ability to raise certain challenges on appeal, the court could not address the constitutional issue concerning the statute as presented. Therefore, the court overruled the father's contentions of error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the 104th District Court Taylor County, Texas that convicted him of possession of cocaine with intent to deliver (a first-degree felony) and possession of cocaine (a second-degree felony) under Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 481.102(3)(D) (Supp. 2005), 481.112(a), 481.112(d), 481.115(a), 481.115(d) (2003).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the denial of his motion to suppress, the sufficiency of the indictment for enhancement purposes, and claimed his conviction for both offenses violated the protections against double jeopardy. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's suppression motion because the police officer had reasonable suspicion to initiate the traffic stop, the evidence was seized after the cocaine fell from defendant's pocket during a pat down search, and the officer had not completed issuing the traffic citations when a canine search occurred; therefore the fact that the police waited minutes until the canine unit arrived did not violated defendant's rights under the Fourth Amendment. The court also held that defendant failed to preserve the sufficiency of the indictment claim by raising it in a pretrial motion, and that the State was not required to allege prior convictions for enhancement with the same particularity that was required in charging the primary offense. The court reversed defendant's possession conviction on double jeopardy grounds because he could not be convicted of two possession offenses based on the same physical evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the portion of the trial court judgment convicting defendant of second-degree possession of cocaine and rendered a judgment of acquittal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiffs, a corporation and wholly owned subsidiary, sued the defendant flood control district, contesting an ad valorem tax. The trial court granted the district's motions for summary judgment. The subsidiary appealed. The Court of Appeals, Fifth District, Dallas (Texas), affirmed the decision of the trial court in part, reversed in part, and remanded. All parties moved for rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its motion for rehearing, the subsidiary argued the court of appeal's opinion improperly ignored the U.S. Supreme Court's holding, decided on equal protection grounds, that a tax levied in a grossly discriminatory manner violated the Fourteenth Amendment. It asserted that the inclusion of the property in the district was not the critical issue, as it was the resultant action that determined whether its constitutional rights were violated. The subsidiary's motion argued it was the consequence and effect of the legislation and the manner in which the legislative power was effectuated that could be challenged by a taxpayer, and that was precisely what it did in this controversy. The subsidiary's presubmission briefing set forth no argument or authority to support its contention. Because it failed to provide the argument and authority necessary to make the appellate complaint viable, the court of appeal's opinion held its brief waived any federal equal protection arguments and presented nothing for review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the District Court of Travis County, 167th Judicial District (Texas), which convicted defendant, pursuant to Tex.

In accordance with a plea bargain agreement, the trial court sentenced defendant to six years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 841.085 violated the constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishments, U.S. Const. amend. VIII, Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, because a prison term of two to ten years was constitutionally disproportionate to the violation of a commitment requirement. The court found no merit in defendant's claim, observing that defendant had not contended that Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 841.085 (2003) was unconstitutionally applied to him. Because the cause did not implicate First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, rights, defendant did not have standing to assert the constitutional rights of others.

Recent case law established that the provision was not vague on its face, and defendant did not argue that it was vague as applied to numerous phone calls and more than 20 messages over the course of a weekend, in which defendant screamed vulgarities at the complainant, defendant's ex-wife.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother sued for divorce from the child's father. The paternal grandparents intervened in the action seeking access or reasonable visitation with the child under Tex. Fam. Code Ann., &sect; 153.433. The mother was appointed sole managing conservator for the child, with the father's access being severely limited. The grandparents were granted access. The mother agreed that it was in the best interests of the child for the grandparents to have access and requested specific findings of fact to that effect. On appeal, however, the mother argued that the statute was unconstitutional based on the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Troxel and that the trial court abused its discretion in granting grandparent access. The appellate court held that the mother could not raise the constitutional issue for the first time on appeal. Further, as the mother had not contended that the grandparents should not be allowed access, only the terms of access, the guidelines set forth in Troxel, which involved a Washington statute, would not apply because of differences in the statutes and the fact that Troxel was a plurality opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Criminal District Court No. 3 of Tarrant County (Texas) denied defendant's pre-trial application for writ of habeas corpus relief and convicted him of the felony offense of burglary of a habitation. The jury found allegations in the enhancement and habitual paragraphs of the indictment to be true and sentenced him to life imprisonment. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1999, police suspected defendant in several burglaries and watched him one day gain entry into a house not his own. He claimed he committed the action because earlier police had coerced him into doing so by threatening arrest and said that they would &quot;cover&quot; him. He testified that when caught he was not taking the property of his own intent or design. He contended that the use of his 1973 theft conviction to enhance his sentence for both a 1994 conviction and the present one violated his ex post facto and double jeopardy rights. The appellate court found his denial of guilt did not amount to a denial of the offense of burglary, was not a denial of the intent to commit the crime, and was not analogous to cases where parties claimed they did not know they were transporting drugs while simultaneously claiming that police had induced them to transport drugs. Thus he could argue entrapment. But an average person would not have been induced to burglarize by the threat of arrest.  Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.46 (Vernon 1994) increased the penalty for neither a 1973 crime nor a current offense after the date of its commission. The prosecutor calling defendant a liar was cured.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a 6-year-old was sexually abused by an older brother, other siblings told investigators that defendant was aware that sexual abuse had happened in the past. Defendant was convicted, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court found that Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 261.101(a) was not unconstitutionally vague. Because defendant never reported the prior sexual abuse that had occurred between the older brother and another sibling, her conduct was clearly covered by the statute. Since the statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant, she also failed to show that it was unconstitutional on its face. Next, the evidence was legally sufficient on the element of harm; defendant had cause to believe that the sibling's mental health, physical health, or welfare had been adversely affected by the abuse. Even though certain statements regarding defendant's knowledge were recanted, it was within the province of the jury to resolve the conflicts in the evidence. Finally, a jury could have rationally determined that defendant had cause to believe that the sibling's mental or physical health had been adversely affected within the statute of limitations period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a negotiated plea to aggravated sexual assault of a child under 14 years of age and was placed on deferred adjudication probation. The State moved to proceed with adjudication on the grounds that defendant had not complied with the conditions of probation. The trial court adjudicated defendant guilty and sentenced him to 15 years in prison. Defendant argued that the trial court abused its discretion in not allowing him to remain on probation, as defendant was caring for his sick mother, and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 5(b) (Vernon Supp. 2002) was unconstitutional, as applied to him. The appellate court held that &sect; 42.12, &sect;5(b) prohibited appeals from a trial court's decision to adjudicate guilt, and the court lacked jurisdiction to consider defendant's first issue. Defendant waived the challenge to the statute by not objecting in the trial court. Even if he had not, the appellate court previously held that the statute denying a deferred adjudication probationer the right to appeal the trial court's determination to proceed with adjudication was rationally related to a legitimate State interest and was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an interlocutory appeal, defendants, town, chief of police, and sheriff, appealed the judgment of the 188th Judicial District Court of Gregg County (Texas) which denied defendants' pleas to the jurisdiction in a declaratory judgment cause of action brought by plaintiff against defendants regarding the legality of plaintiff's amusement machines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Attorney General issued an opinion that Tex. Penal Code Ann.  &sect; 47.01(4) was unconstitutional and determined that plaintiff's amusement machines were illegal gambling devices. After a criminal complaint was filed against plaintiff for possession of a gambling device, plaintiff brought a cause of action against defendants, town, chief of police, and sheriff, seeking an injunction against criminal prosecution and to have Tex. Penal Code Ann. ch. 47 declared unconstitutional. Plaintiff later filed an amended complaint in which he withdrew his request for an injunction. Defendants then filed pleas to the jurisdiction. The trial court denied defendants' pleas and assumed jurisdiction over the case. The appellate court reversed and remanded. The trial court did not have jurisdiction to decide the constitutionality of a penal statute because the relief sought was only declaratory. Plaintiff failed to demonstrate a vested property right and a naked declaration that a penal statute was unconstitutional, without a valid request for injunctive relief, was not within the civil trial court's jurisdiction. On remand, the trial court was to dismiss for want of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed and remanded. Plaintiff failed to seek injunctive relief, therefore, the civil trial court lacked the jurisdiction to declare a penal statute unconstitutional. On remand, the trial court was instructed to dismiss for want of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court revoked appellant's community supervision upon the State's motion alleging he sold alcohol to a minor. On appeal, he contended the evidence was legally and factually insufficient, the transcript incorrectly recorded a plea of true to the allegations, the court erred in failing to issue findings of fact, Tex. Alco. Bev. Code &sect; 106.03 was unconstitutional, and there was a material and fatal variance between the State's motion to revoke and the evidence at the hearing. The court reformed the judgment to reflect the entry of appellant's plea of not true to the allegations, and as reformed, affirmed revocation. Evidence was legally and factually sufficient that appellant was criminally negligent in selling alcohol to a minor, and mistake of fact was not a viable defense. Due process was satisfied, as it was sufficient for the court to revoke on the one allegation alleged in the motion. Appellant's constitutional claim was waived, as no objection was voiced in the trial court, and the variance issue was moot, as the trial court signed amended motions after the hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reformed and affirmed.

The ordinance was not shown to be vague in all of its applications; [3]-Because the record contained more than a scintilla of evidence illustrating that the applicant was located in a residential area, the decision by the city to deny the applicant a permit to sell beer had the support of substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer stated that he arrested the husband after meeting with the wife and preparing an arrest warrant. The officer stated that the wife was distraught. Based on his observations of the wife, the officer arrested the husband and requested a protective order from the judge. The appellate court found that a 61 day emergency protective order granted pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 17.292 (2003), like the one against the husband, was capable of repetition yet evading review; thus, an exception to the mootness doctrine applied. Also, there was a stigma attached to the issuance of a protective order as well as attendant legal consequences; thus, the collateral consequences exception to the mootness doctrine also applied. Thus, the appellate court considered the husband's constitutional challenge to art. 17.292. However, the appellate court found that art. 17.292 was constitutional because of its temporary and emergency nature. Also, the availability of the writ of habeas corpus procedure afforded the husband the opportunity to obtain an adversarial hearing to contest the emergency protective order, which ameliorated the ex parte nature of the procedure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's denial of the husband's writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury rendered a verdict terminating appellant mother's parental rights to her three children, the 410th District Court of Montgomery County (Texas) entered judgment terminating the mother's and father's parental right. The mother challenged the judgment on the grounds that she received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and that Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 263.405(i) (2006) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two of the ineffective assistance of counsel claims were not considered because the mother had not presented them to the trial court in her statement of points or in her motion for a new trial. The claim that trial counsel was ineffective for not requesting the trial court to sever the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services' case against her from its case against the father was overruled because the record was undeveloped and as a result, trial counsel's strategy was not apparent. The claim that trial counsel did not object to the jury charge was also overruled as the testimony raised an issue concerning the degree to which the mother visited or maintained contact with her children and thus, it was appropriate to submit the issue to the jury. The claim that the operative effect of Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 263.405(i) (2006), i.e., waiver of complaints not presented in the trial court, violated the mother's due process and equal protection rights was not preserved for appellate review as her points of appeal and motion for a new trial did not contain objections to the constitutionality of the statute, nor did they complain that the statute was facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Eleventh Court of Appeals, Young County, Texas, convicted defendants of attack by dog resulting in death, Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 822.005(a)(1). The jury sentenced each to seven years' confinement and a $5,000 fine. The court of appeals affirmed. Defendants petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 822.005(a)(1) was facially void and void for vagueness because, by not defining the words &quot;attack&quot; and &quot;unprovoked,&quot; it failed to provide adequate notice of what conduct was prohibited. The court of criminal appeals found that failure to secure a dog was the conduct prohibited in the statute, and the key word in the statute, &quot;Secure,&quot; was defined. The statute contained objective criteria for determining what conduct was prohibited and therefore did not permit arbitrary enforcement. In this statute, the elements of the prohibited conduct were clearly defined: a mens rea of criminal negligence, and the actus reus of failing to secure a dog. An appellant who engaged in conduct that was clearly proscribed could not complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to others. Defendants engaged in the proscribed conduct of failing to secure their dogs. The jurors were able to agree on the single criminal act of defendants' failure to secure the dogs and convicted defendants on the basis of this conduct, not on the conduct of the dogs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.15(b)(1) (Supp. 2006). The 210th District Court of El Paso County, Texas, quashed the indictment on the ground that &sect; 21.15 was unconstitutional. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 21.15(b)(1) established an offense for taking photographs of a person without consent and with the intent to arouse or gratify sexual desire. In reversing the decision to quash the indictment, the court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad or vague. The facial overbreadth challenge failed because defendant failed to show how the statute substantially reached constitutionally protected activity. The proscribed conduct, when committed with the requisite intent and without consent, was an offensive invasion of the privacy rights of a nonconsenting party. Under such restrictions, the statute could not be said to criminalize a substantial amount of protected expressive activity. The vagueness challenge failed because the statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant. Facts at the hearing indicated that defendant took numerous photographs of a sleeping 7-year-old child, that he lifted her shirt and repositioned her in order to photograph her anal and vaginal areas, and that he took several of the photographs in such close proximity that only the child's buttocks and vagina were visible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order and remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The father's argument pertaining to &sect; 263.401 lacked an arguable basis in law and in fact. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting this argument as frivolous. The father voluntarily requested the relinquishment of his parental rights and did not challenge the voluntariness of the relinquishment or that it was the result of overreaching, fraud, or duress. The State had a legitimate interest in ensuring the security and stability of children placed in this position. Due process did not require the child's rights to be sacrificed to preserve rights which the father had waived.

Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 841.001-.147 (2003 &amp; Supp. 2004), and the final judgment and order of commitment were unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court rejected defendant's argument, relying on case precedent to hold that the statute was not a punitive. The order required defendant to live in the county to which he had been paroled, and stated that he could not change his residence without prior authorization from the court. Thus, defendant's argument regarding improper delegation of court authority lacked merit. Defendant's other arguments were not properly preserved as the complained-of documents regarding his mandatory treatment were not attached to the judgment. Because defendant's complaint that he was compelled to give a deposition was not presented to the trial court, the issue was not preserved for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's writ of mandamus compelled the city council to honor the citizens' petition for referendum relating to the sale of city-owned property. The council members contended the trial court erred in denying their summary judgment motion and in granting the citizens' motion because the petition's subject matter was not legislative in character. The appellate court disagreed. The ordinance at issue in this case authorized a permanent, uniquely policy-oriented act. The ordinance was thus not routine; nor was it the implementation of a previously-enacted law. Therefore, the ordinance was legislative in nature as a matter of law. Because the petition for referendum concerned a legislative matter, and the subject matter of the petition had not been withdrawn or excluded from the initiative and referendum process, the city council could not decline its mandatory duty to call and hold an initiative election regarding the offer of land for sale.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother filed a negligence, wrongful death, and premises liability lawsuit in the District Court of Tarrant County, 96th Judicial District, Texas, against appellee Texas Department of Transportation (DOT). The DOT filed a plea to the jurisdiction, which the trial court granted and dismissed the mother's lawsuit. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In her lawsuit, the mother alleged DOT was negligent in failing to install continuous guardrails or barriers and had actual or constructive knowledge of the danger posed by the lack of such barriers. The DOT filed a plea to the jurisdiction, contending that the mother's causes of action did not fall under the Texas Tort Claims Act, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 101.001 - 101.106 (1997 &amp; Supp. 2003), or any other provision that would waive its sovereign immunity. On appeal, the mother argued it was not apparent from her pleadings that her suit was barred by sovereign immunity, and that the trial court's application of the Act amounted to a deprivation of substantive due process. The appellate court held the placement or lack of a guardrail reflected discretionary decisions for which the DOT retained immunity. The appellate court further held the mother did not satisfy her burden of showing clear and certain grounds for holding the Act unconstitutional as applied to her other than a general statement regarding the purpose of due process guarantees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a criminal appeal, defendant did not meet his burden of proof of showing that his sentence of twenty-five years' imprisonment was grossly disproportionate to the offense of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Because his complaint was not made to the trial court, it was not preserved for appellate review. Although defendant attempted to bypass the issue of waiver with his challenge to the constitutionality of a punishment statute as applied, its unconstitutionality was not apparent and therefore not subject to review. Defendant's sentence was well within the statutory limitation for a first degree felony under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.32(a) (2011).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee allegedly stood up during a speech and shouted an epithet. Subsequently charged with a crime, the information accused appellee of disrupting a meeting, in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann.  &sect; 42.05. At issue on appeal was whether the lower court erred in granting appellee's motion to quash or set aside the information, on the basis that &sect; 42.05 was unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The court, in reversing the lower court, noted that the court had previously held that &sect; 42.05 was not unconstitutionally overbroad on its face. The lower court erred by concluding otherwise. In its second point of error the State contended the lower court erred by dismissing the information on the ground that &sect; 42.05 was unconstitutionally vague. Section 42.05 was sufficiently clear and understandable to satisfy U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. The State's second point of error was sustained.

The magistrate court held that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 28.061 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual had been charged with murder and convicted. The individual was later granted habeas corpus relief. The State obtained a new murder indictment against the individual, who filed this pretrial writ of habeas corpus seeking dismissal of the prosecution. The jail magistrate denied the individual's motion for dismissal and habeas corpus application. On appeal, the court reversed and ordered that the indictment be dismissed. The individual argued that the magistrate court erred in finding that the prosecution for murder was not barred because former Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 28.061 violated Tex. Const. art. II, &sect; 1. The court agreed with case law and found that prior Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 32.01, 28.061 were constitutional. The court found it unnecessary to address the individual's remaining points on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter was remanded to the court for reconsideration of certain of defendant's points of error. The court found no error and affirmed. The evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support defendant's conviction under Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.115(e) (2003). Both experts testified that the mixture or solution in a glass jar and the mixture or solution in a bottle contained methamphetamine and that the weight of each mixture or solution was over 200 grams. The definition of controlled substance in former Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.002(5) (2000) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied. Although the percentage of pure methamphetamine contained in the solution or mixture was relatively small, the statute clearly provided that it was illegal to possess a controlled substance and that the aggregate weight of any mixture or solution would be used to determine the amount of controlled substance possessed. Furthermore, a person of ordinary intelligence should have known what conduct was prohibited given the definition of controlled substance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because defendant did not show that he could not challenge the grand jury array, the trial court was not obligated to consider his late challenge to the array and therefore he failed to preserve the issue for appellate review under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 19.27 (2005). Even though the trial court erred by excluding from evidence videos of interviews with children using improper interview techniques on the ground that they were inadmissible hearsay, the error was harmless because defendant did not identify for the trial court areas on the recordings that were of particular importance or relevance and his expert witness was able to testify without reservation about what he observed on the videos and the jury saw examples of many of the techniques he said were improper. The trial court did not err by allowing the State to offer evidence that defendant sexually assaulted his stepdaughter when she was a child under Tex. R. Evid. 404(b) because defense counsel had made the implicit assertion that defendant had characteristics or had done things that were inconsistent with being the kind of person who would sexually assault a child or in allowing the State to rebut that assertion.</SPAN></P>

The information tracked the language of Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect; 550.025 (1999), it alleged only damage to a wooden fence, defendant failed to prove harm from an alleged deficiency in the information, and he was aware of the offense with which he was charged, and thus the information was sufficient to apprise him of the offense, for purposes of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 21.11 (1989). Defendant failed to identify how the statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him and thus he waived his challenge to the statute. He had no standing to challenge the statute as facially vague and it was his burden to show that a person of ordinary intelligence in the circumstances that he was in would have believed that providing the statutory notice 36 to 38 hours after the accident would have constituted taking &quot;reasonable steps&quot; under the statute, which burden he did not meet.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged under Tex. Penal Code &sect; 21.15(b)(1) with improper photography. The 248th District Court, Harris County, Texas, denied his pretrial application for writ of habeas corpus, in which he argued that &sect; 21.15(b)(1) violated the First Amendment and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals found that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.15(b)(1) was not unconstitutional on its face. First, it was not a regulation of speech or expression, but rather of the intent of the photographer, and therefore did not violate the First Amendment. Second, the statute did not restrict a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech, and therefore was not overbroad. Although it was not as narrowly tailored as some other similar statutes, it regulated conduct that fell within the scope of an otherwise valid criminal law that reflected legitimate state interests in maintaining comprehensive controls over harmful, constitutionally unprotected conduct. Finally, the statute was sufficiently definite to avoid impinging on First Amendment freedoms, to avoid the possibility of arbitrary arrests and convictions, and to provide fair notice of the conduct proscribed, and therefore was not vague. The court rejected the argument that the statute was rendered vague by the subjective requirement that the photograph be taken with intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a breach-of-contract case, the District Court of Travis County, 53rd Judicial District (Texas), affirmed the decision of the Texas Department of Agriculture Produce Recovery Fund Board, finding that appellant produce company had breached the contract with appellee farmer and awarding the farmer $ 35,000 to be paid out of the Texas Produce Recovery Fund and additional monies to be paid by the company. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company and the farmer entered into a contract for the sale of carrots. After some of the carrots were harvested, the parties accused each other of breaching the contract. The farmer filed a claim with the Board. The company then filed a claim in a trial court. The farmer then filed a counterclaim in that court. Additionally, the farmer filed a request for a jury trial in that court. After the Board reached its decision, the company argued that it was denied its right to a jury trial guaranteed by Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 15. The appellate court found that the company's right to defend against a breach of contract claim and to bring its own claim for breach of contract were established rights that could be tried to a jury before the enactment of the Texas Constitution in 1876. The appellate court found that any right to a jury trial that existed at the time of the adoption of the constitution was confirmed. Thus, because the company was unable to receive a jury trial on a breach-of-contract claim, the appellate court held that the Board's imposition of money damages against the company violated the company's right to a trial by a jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the district court's final order and rendered a judgment vacating the order of the Board.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Criminal District Court 4, Dallas County, Texas, of possession with intent to deliver cocaine, possession of marihuana, and unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon. The jury assessed punishment at 35 years' confinement for possession with intent to deliver, two years' confinement for possession of marihuana, and 10 years' confinement for unlawful possession of a firearm. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the State committed prosecutorial misconduct in its closing argument. For the purpose of determining whether the trial court erred in denying the motion for mistrial, the instant court assumed without deciding that the jury argument was improper. Because defendant did pursue his objection to an adverse ruling by requesting a mistrial and obtaining an adverse ruling on that request, his complaint was preserved for appeal. The instant court found that the State's argument was not so prejudicial that its effect could not have been cured by a judicial instruction. Defendant's second and third issues on appeal contended that Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.134(c) (Supp. 2004-05) was unconstitutional on its face, as it did not require proof of a mental state and it was arbitrary and capricious. Section 481.134(c) did not create a separate offense; its only effect was to raise the penalty when an enumerated offense was committed in a designated place. Section 481.134(c) was not unconstitutional for failing to require additional knowledge or intent. The 1,000-foot drug-free zone imposed by &sect; 481.134(c) was not arbitrary or capricious.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 255.001 was unconstitutional, as it infringed on First Amendment rights. The State petitioned for discretionary review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a local campaign, defendant created and circulated a political flyer that described an incumbent candidate for local office as &quot;Pinocchio.&quot; The flyer was published anonymously and distributed by a publishing company through a bulk mailing. Defendant was indicted for violating Tex. Elec. Code Ann. &sect; 255.001. The court agreed with the intermediate appellate court that the statute impermissibly infringed on First Amendment free speech rights. The court held that the statute impermissibly regulated political speech, as it required a person to add personal information to the text of his message. Applying an exacting level of scrutiny, the court held that the statute was not narrowly tailored to meet concerns about deterring political corruption, notifying the public of allegiances, and providing a method for detecting political spending. The statute was too sweeping, as other statutes and reporting requirements already addressed the stated concerns. Also, the statute's application only to agreements between two or more persons prevented all but the most resourceful individuals from publishing political advertising without revealing their identities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners brought a declaratory judgment action in response to defendant homeowners' association attempt to increase annual assessments and impose late fees. The trial court held that Tex. Prop. Code Ann. ch. 204 authorized the association to raise assessments unilaterally. The Texas Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment in part and reversed in part. The parties cross-petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners' association was the association for several subdivisions. The association amended deed restrictions to expand its board and to assess late fees on unpaid assessments. One of the questions presented on appeal was whether the trial court should have refused to enter a judgment when a subset of the homeowners was not joined in the lawsuit. Nothing precluded the trial court from rendering complete relief among the association and the eight homeowners who had sued for a declaration of rights. Nevertheless, the supreme court lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal of claims for plaintiffs not joined in the suit. The association attempted to argue that the deed restrictions should be divided into three steps: the restrictions created a maintenance fund at $ 120; the board had discretion to determine the rate to be assessed above $ 120; and the assessment rate could be adjusted. The associations' arguments did not survive the deed restrictions' plain language. Further, accumulation was not permitted. The supreme court next held that the association could impose a late fee, and that charge was constitutional. Foreclosure for failure to pay late charges was not an option.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed as to the assessment of late fees and foreclosure; it reversed the court of appeals' judgment and rendered judgment as to the accumulation of fee increases. The supreme court dismissed, for want of jurisdiction, the claims for whom there were no plaintiffs, and it affirmed regarding attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals, in reversing, sustained defendant's contentions that the indictment failed to allege a culpable mental state and did not specify what rights, privileges, powers, or immunities were at issue. The court vacated and remanded, finding that defendant did not preserve the issue of culpable mental state for appeal by identifying a substantive defect in the indictment as required under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 1.14(b), which implemented Tex. Const. art. 12(b) in creating an affirmative duty to object to any defect before trial. As to rights, privileges, powers, and immunities, the court of appeals erred in its harm analysis under Tex. Code Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for making repeated harassing telephone calls to the president of a company from which she had been fired. She argued that &sect; 42.07 was unconstitutionally vague and overly broad. The court disagreed. As to over breadth, &sect; 42.07(a)(4) did not sweep within its coverage any protected activity under the First Amendment. The mere fact that communications were made, as opposed to repeated hang ups or anonymous calls, did not turn conduct into speech. As to vagueness, the language of the statute explained the kind of conduct that was illegal, and a reasonable person in defendant's position would have known that phoning someone repeatedly, for 10 days in a row, knowing and intending that the calls were unwelcome and harassing, was a criminal offense. The court also found that there was no fundamental defect in the indictment. Although it alleged &quot;repeated communications,&quot; rather than &quot;repeated telephone communications,&quot; another clause stated that defendant made unwelcome telephone calls. Although it included two lesser mental states, it also alleged that defendant, with the intent to harass the complainant, made repeated phone calls intentionally.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on defendant's pleas of true, the Criminal District Court No. 3 of Tarrant County, Texas, found that defendant had committed each violation in a revocation petition, adjudicated him guilty of theft, and sentenced him to one year of confinement in state jail. The trial court also revoked defendant's community supervision on a securities offense and sentenced him to three years of confinement. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that former Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 42.12, &sect; 5(b), and the limited application of the amended statute violated his equal protection and due process rights, and that the trial court abused its discretion by proceeding to adjudicate his guilt and revoking his community supervision. The court previously rejected the argument that former art. 42.12, &sect; 5(b), was unconstitutional on equal protection or due process grounds. The court also relied on its previous decisions in rejecting defendant's claim that the limited application of the amended statute was also unconstitutional. Because defendant pled true to every allegation in the State's petition to revoke the probated sentence, the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's revocation of community supervision. Even though defendant raised defensive issues on each violation at the hearing, the trial court was not required to withdraw his pleas of true under the circumstances. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by revoking defendant's community supervision.</SPAN></P>

He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty and received six years of deferred adjudication for improper photography and visual recording, as prohibited by Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.15. Appellant did not file a direct appeal to challenge the constitutionality of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.15, but instead filed a motion for new trial and then an application for a writ of habeas corpus. Because appellant had an adequate remedy at law by direct appeal, his constitutional claim was not cognizable by an application for a writ of habeas corpus. Appellant also contended the evidence was insufficient to find him guilty. He made a judicial confession of his guilt to the trial court, which constituted some evidence to substantiate his guilt. Therefore, the original judgment was not void. The trial court did not err by denying habeas corpus relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant became angry, loud, and disruptive while in a city government office. Police removed him from the building and warned him that he would be arrested for criminal trespass if he returned to that office. Thereafter, he returned to the office and was asked to leave by a police officer. When defendant refused, he was arrested for trespass. The court, in affirming, stated that although the departmental staff did not own the building, they did have a greater right to possession of the office than defendant did. Accordingly, relative to defendant and for purposes of criminal trespass, the members of the departmental staff were the effective owners, as defined in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 1.07(a)(35)(A), of the office. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss, in which defendant asserted that the criminal trespass statute was unconstitutional as applied to him because it was being used to regulate his speech rather than his conduct. The court determined that defendant was arrested for, and charged with, criminal trespass not for the content of his complaints but for his conduct in voicing them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant stabbed a pregnant woman, killing both her and the unborn child. During the penalty phase of his trial, a prosecution witness incorrectly testified that if sentenced to life without parole, he might become eligible for a less restrictive prison classification status. The State conceded federal constitutional error. Taking judicial notice pursuant to Tex. R. Evid. 201(b)-(d) of a regulation that prohibited such reclassification, the court found it probable that the death sentence was based upon the incorrect testimony. The court overruled all other points of error that it addressed. Sufficient evidence supported the jury's affirmative answer to the Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071, &sect; 2(b)(1) future-dangerousness special issue. Aggressive questioning at the police station did not violate Miranda rights or require voluntariness instructions under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.22, &sect;&sect; 6, 7 because the evidence showed that appellant knew he was not in custody and was free to leave at any time. A charge of killing a fetus, as defined in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 1.07(a), was constitutionally permissible and was properly charged to the jury and supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction, set aside the death sentence, and remanded to the trial court for a new punishment hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services (TDPRS), appealed a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the First District of Texas, which held that the holder of a child-care facility license had a statutory right to judicial review. Respondent child care provider had challenged the TDPRS's revocation of its license to operate a day care.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether one who held a child-care facility license could obtain judicial review of an administrative decision to revoke the license. In affirming, the court held that, in the absence of express statutory language prohibiting judicial review, a legislative intent to prohibit judicial review had to be established by specific legislative history or other reliable evidence of intent. Given the inconclusive evidence regarding legislative intent in the case, the court concluded that, in enacting the TDPRS's 1997 sunset review legislation, the legislature did not intend to prohibit judicial review of contested-case decisions made under Tex. Hum. Res. Code Ann. &sect; 42.072. Accordingly, the provider was entitled to judicial review of the administrative decision to revoke its child-care facility license. The court's finding that Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 2001.171, a provision of the Texas Administrative Procedure Act, provided an independent right to judicial review when an agency enabling statute neither specifically authorized nor prohibited judicial review was dispositive of the issue of sovereign immunity. Section 2001.171 provided a limited waiver of sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the court of appeals' judgment.</SPAN></P>

The Palo Pinto County, 29th District Court (Texas) assessed their punishments at confinement for 25 years. Both appealed denial of their pretrial motions to suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A highway patrolman stopped a vehicle being driven by one defendant; the other defendant was in the passenger seat. After stopping the car, the officer could see a plastic baggie under the right front passenger's seat, without intruding his body into the car. The officer testified at the suppression hearing that when he looked at the baggie he observed a brownish, rock-type substance which he had seen on many occasions, and that based on his experience and training he believed the substance was methamphetamine. Defendants argued that their vehicle was stopped pursuant to an unconstitutional statute. Because the appellate court found the officer had made a valid traffic stop and because when the officer looked into the automobile he saw in plain view what appeared to be methamphetamine, the trial court had not erred in denying defendants' motions to suppress the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 338th District Court, Harris County, Texas, denied appellant's motion to quash an indictment.

Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 841.001-.147 (2003 &amp; Supp. 2005). The trial court sentenced appellant to confinement for 25 years. Appellant filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found to be a sexually violent predator. The trial court imposed a number of commitment requirements. Appellant violated the terms of his treatment plan when pornographic images and articles about men molesting children were found in his possession. Appellant was indicted for violating the terms of his commitment as a sexually violent predator. Appellant moved to quash the indictment, arguing that the charging instrument and the underlying statute were unconstitutional, facially and as applied, and that the Act was vague and overbroad. The appellate court determined that the trial court properly denied appellant's motion to quash. The Act, and the order drafted pursuant to the express terms of Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 841.082 (2003), were not unconstitutional for vagueness or overbreadth, because the fact that the Act permitted the trial court to allow professionals to determine a specific course of treatment did not render the statute unconstitutionally vague. Appellant's treatment plan was not unconstitutionally vague, because it provided him specific notice of what was required of him. Appellant failed to preserve his as-applied challenge for review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court overruled appellant's sole issue and affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant resident sued appellee towing company alleging, among other claims, that it failed to comply with Tex. Transp. Code Ann.  &sect; 684 (Vernon 1999).The County Court at Law No. 3, Dallas County, Texas, rendered a take-nothing judgment on all of his claims, granting the company's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on his breach of contract claim. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Signs were posted on the resident's apartment complex's property stating that vehicles having invalid registration or inspection stickers would be towed at their owner's expense. The towing company towed the resident's vehicle. He sued for compensation, charges, punitive damages, and attorney's fees. The appellate court held that the resident failed to establish that the company violated any provision of Tex. Transp. Code Ann.  &sect;&sect; 684.014 and 684.084 which would not have been preempted by 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 14501(c)(1) nor excepted from preemption by the unambiguous safety regulation exception found in &sect; 14501(c)(2)(C).  Tex. Transp. Code Ann. 684.014's signage and notice requirements were preempted because their dominant purpose was merely consumer protection. It was irrelevant that the resident, an individual, rather than the State was seeking to enforce state policy. Mere testimony by a company employee that signs about towing were there for the benefit of the apartments and residents, without other evidence, failed to show that the resident was a third-party beneficiary to any contract. No breach by the company was shown.</SPAN></P>

His pretrial writ was denied, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court only analyzed the case under the United States Constitution. It determined that Tex.

The statute was not overbroad, as it did not limit a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. Finally, the statute was not vague because it did not impinge on U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband was riding as a passenger in his wife's car. After an accident occurred, he filed a lawsuit and recovered damages. This appeal followed from the wife. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the trial court did not err by failing to follow Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 72.001 (2008), which would have allowed recovery only if the wife caused the accident intentionally or by gross negligence, because it was unconstitutional. Next, because there was an untimely motion providing inadequate proof of the content of Louisiana law regarding spousal immunity, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by applying Texas law instead. The trial court did not err by denying requests for a directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Finally, the appeal was not frivolous in nature under Tex. R.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 94th District Court, Nueces County, Texas, granted appellee merchants a temporary injunction that prevented appellant city from enforcing two city ordinances, Corpus Christi, Tex., Ordinances ch. 33, art. IX, &sect;&sect; 33-124, 33-126 (2011), to the extent the ordinances banned &quot;illegal smoking paraphernalia.&quot; The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued that the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the merchants' claim for a temporary injunction because equitable relief was not available when a criminal prosecution was imminent, and the invalidity of a penal ordinance could be raised as a defense to prosecution. The appellate court found that while the city had a legitimate interest in protecting health and safety, the ordinances were so broad as to criminalize possession of pipes traditionally used to smoke legal tobacco products. The ordinances prohibited the merchants from selling pipes traditionally used for smoking tobacco, prohibited prospective customers from purchasing pipes of this type, and at least one merchant's property was seized because it was allegedly illegal under the new ordinance. The merchants presented evidence in the trial court that their businesses were being severely curtailed by the ordinances. They demonstrated irreparable harm to a vested property right resulting from the enforcement of the penal ordinances. The temporary-injunction order violated Tex. R. Civ. P. 683 and therefore was void and of no effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, hospitals, challenged the judgment of the 201st Judicial District Court of Travis County, Texas, denying the hospitals' request to reverse 1,406 orders issued by appellee Texas Department of Insurance, Division of Workers' Compensation (DWC). The DWC challenged the declaration that former Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect; 413.031(k) was facially unconstitutional for failure to provide an opportunity for a contested case hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospitals filed suit for declaratory and injunctive relief against the DWC and appellee DWC commissioner. The hospitals asserted that former Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect; 413.031(k) operated unconstitutionally in medical fee disputes. The appellate court ruled that former Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect; 413.031(k) was facially constitutional. The hospitals had neglected to demonstrate that former Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect; 413.031(k) operated unconstitutionally in medical necessity disputes, and therefore, failed to satisfy their burden of showing that former Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect; 413.031(k) was unconstitutional in all of its applications. Also, the hospitals failed to file their petitions for judicial review of the 1,406 DWC decisions within the required 30-day time frame, and the district court was without jurisdiction to consider them. The requirement in Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 2001.176(a) that suit for judicial review must be filed within 30 days of the DWC decision becoming final and appealable was jurisdictional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the judgment denying the hospitals' request to set aside the 1,406 decisions issued by the DWC was affirmed, and the judgment was otherwise reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictment tracked the language of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.02(d) (2011). Defendant argued that the indictment failed to provide sufficient notice of the charged offense, that the statute was unconstitutional, and that the trial court erred by failing to adequately guide the jury on the principle of beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court ruled that the indictment was adequate, because the indictment properly alleged a series of sexual abuse as set forth in the statute as constituting two or more of the offenses listed in the statute. The indictment alleged the different means by which defendant was alleged to have committed the offense by listing in detail the specific acts of sexual abuse allegedly committed by him. Also, because defendant did not assert any constitutional infirmity within the statute before the trial court, defendant forfeited the complaint. Furthermore, courts may or may not define the term &quot;reasonable doubt,&quot; and the better practice was to give no definition of reasonable doubt at all to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the 180th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which convicted him of causing the death of a person by intentionally and knowingly participating in a drag race, in violation of Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect; 545.420(a)(3) (Supp. 2009).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for causing the death of a person by intentionally and knowingly participating in a drag race. He filed a motion to quash the indictment. The trial court denied the motion. He pled no contest. On appeal, the court found that &sect; 545.420 was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant. The indictment specifically alleged that he was operating a motor vehicle while participating in a drag race. Section 545.420 clearly prohibited an individual from operating a motor vehicle in a drag race. Further, the indictment alleged that defendant was operating a motor vehicle. Section 545.420 applied to &quot;vehicles,&quot; as defined in Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect; 541.201(23). Finally, the indictment alleged that defendant was drag racing on a &quot;highway,&quot; as defined in Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect; 541.302(5) (1999). Section 545.420 adequately detailed the prohibited conduct to the extent that enforcement of the statute was not relegated to the subjective interpretation of law enforcement on the scene. The language of &sect; 545.420 provided sufficient guidance to law enforcement so that it was not so indefinite that it encouraged arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder, and on appeal argued that he was denied due process by the failure to provide him with a vehicle by which the jury could give effect to mitigating evidence of sudden passion, and that the court erred in failing to instruct the jury that it was required to unanimously decide on the sudden passion issue before it could assess punishment. The appeals court rejected both arguments and affirmed judgment.  Tex. Penal Code Ann.  &sect; 19.02 did not prescribe the form or manner of accompanying instructions for submission of sudden passion. However, the court did instruct the jury on the issue of sudden passion, and it replied it had not found any. Thus, the court could conclude appellant failed to persuade the jury of this issue. Further, the jury was not required to unanimously find sudden passion before it could proceed to punishment, but had to be unanimous in its final verdict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order of the County Criminal Court, Dallas County, Texas, which denied her pretrial application for writ of habeas corpus. Defendant, a dancer at an adult cabaret, was charged with violating Dallas, Tex., Code &sect; 41A-18.1(a) (2000) by recklessly touching a customer by rubbing her buttocks against the clothed genitals of the customer while she was exposing a portion of her breast.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's application challenged the validity of &sect; 41A-18.1(a). The court found that Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. ch. 243 permitted municipalities to regulate employee/customer conduct and make violations punishable as Class A misdemeanors. Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 243.001-.011 granted municipalities the authority to regulate sexually oriented businesses. Chapter 243 also provided sufficient guidance and limitations to municipalities in enacting ordinances regulating employee/customer conduct in sexually oriented businesses. Pursuant to Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 243.003(a), (b), municipalities could adopt regulations concerning sexually oriented businesses that were necessary to promote the public health, safety, or welfare, which applied only within the corporate limits of the municipality. Chapter 243 did not unconstitutionally delegate authority to municipalities to regulate employee/customer conduct in sexually oriented businesses. Because chapter 243 permitted municipalities to regulate employee/customer conduct and punish violations as Class A misdemeanors, and such was not an unconstitutional delegation of authority, Dallas, Tex., Code &sect; 41A-18.1(a) (2000) was not void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his notice of appeal, defendant argued a jurisdictional defect warranted reversing his conviction. Specifically, he challenged the constitutionality of the Texas Penal Code, in that it contained matters not germane to the title of the bill, in violation of Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35. The appellate court initially noted because defendant's notice of appeal specified that he was appealing only a jurisdictional defect, it could not consider any grounds for reversal other than jurisdictional ones under Tex. R. App. P. 25.2(b)(3), including the voluntariness of his guilty plea. The appellate court admonished Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35(c), provided that courts no longer had the power to declare an act of the legislature unconstitutional due to the insufficiency of the caption. The appellate court concluded the record revealed no jurisdictional defects upon which defendant would have been entitled to reversal.</SPAN></P>

Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 37.011.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee filed suit seeking a declaration that a statute prohibiting the collection and sale of accident reports generated by law enforcement was unconstitutional, an injunction preventing the State from enforcing the statute, and attorney's fees. In a prior order, the court reversed the trial court's decision and found the statute unconstitutional. The court held that the district court's post-appeal award of attorney's fees was not linked to appellee's requested injunctive relief. There was no need for a remedial phase in every declaratory judgment action because the law presumed that the parties will recognize and respect a declaratory judgment. Appellee did not show that the State would not comply with the judgment. By awarding appellee's attorney's fees for the declaratory judgment absent a remand, the district court permitted appellee to litigate an issue that it had waived on appeal. The award of attorney's fees did not serve to effectuate the declaratory judgment. Accordingly, appellee's attorney's fees in obtaining declaratory relief were not necessary or proper further relief under &sect; 37.011.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's award of attorney's fees and rendered a take nothing judgment in favor of the State.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 43.25 and 43.26 violated the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, because the sections were vague, over broad, and violated free speech. Defendant's challenge centered around the application of a U.S. Supreme Court opinion, dealing with the prohibited possession of images if the person depicted appeared to be a minor, not just if the person actually was a minor. The appellate court ruled that the Texas statutes did not refer to images that appeared to be of children, and thus, the rationale underpinning the holding in the U.S. Supreme Court opinion was not applicable to the constitutionality of the Texas statutes. In Texas, a person committed the offense if he knowingly or intentionally possessed visual material that visually depicted a child younger than 18 years of age at the time the image of the child was made who was engaging in sexual conduct, and neither provision referred to images that appeared to be of children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver requested that the trial court enjoin or prohibit any further prosecution or proceedings in the criminal case involving the traffic ticket and any further proceedings in any other criminal matter that could possibly be brought against him. A plea to the jurisdiction was filed, asserting that the trial court could not grant the relief sought because it would result in a court with civil jurisdiction interfering with the enforcement of a penal statute. The trial court found that the plea to the jurisdiction was meritorious. The court, in affirming, considered only the dispositive jurisdictional issue in accordance with Tex. R. App. P. 47.1. The court observed that a civil court had jurisdiction to enter orders relating to a pending criminal matter in a different court only if the complainant attacked the constitutionality of the statute being enforced with specificity and urged that its enforcement would irreparably injure vested property rights. Because the driver stated in his pleadings that he was not alleging any statute to be unconstitutional, the trial court was without jurisdiction to grant him the relief he sought.</SPAN></P>

The trial court imposed an enhanced punishment of eight years' imprisonment and a $ 10,000 fine based on defendant's two prior felony convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving while intoxicated, and police found crack cocaine. Defendant was indicted for possession thereof. Defendant's motion to quash the enhancement paragraph of the indictment, which indicated that he had two prior foreign felony convictions, was denied. He had also sought to declare Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.42(a)(1), (2) (Supp. 2004) unconstitutional. Defendant entered a plea of guilty, and the jury assessed punishment, including an enhancement. On appeal, the court found that defendant's equal protection argument failed, as he would have received the same sentencing enhancements if his crimes had been committed in Texas, rather than Missouri. The court noted that the intent in Missouri was to treat the convictions for burglary under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 569.170 as felonies. Accordingly, the sentence was properly enhanced. Further, the court declined to review defendant's constitutionality challenge, as he had not received a harsher sentence than if he had committed the crimes in Texas. Accordingly, he was not within the group that allegedly received disparate treatment from the enhancement statutes, and the court declined to give an advisory opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment of the 168th Judicial District Court of El Paso County, Texas, denying his pretrial habeas application in which he argued that the second murder indictment against him should be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a habeas application, alleging that he had received ineffective assistance because his trial counsel did not move to dismiss the murder indictment for lack of speedy trial under former Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 32.01, 28.061. The state court denied relief. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted appellant's federal application on ineffective assistance of counsel grounds, and ordered that he be released from custody. When the State obtained a second murder indictment, appellant filed a pretrial habeas application. On appeal, he cited the law of the case doctrine and held that decisions in the trial court, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, and the Fifth Circuit in his prior habeas actions implicitly held former Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 28.061 to be constitutional. The Court of Appeals of Texas disagreed. The prior appellate decisions did not establish the law of this case in appellant's favor; therefore, the doctrine could not act to bar further prosecution now.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a real estate developer, was charged with the misdemeanor offense of unlawful outdoor burning under Tex. Admin. Code &sect; 111.201 (2004). The County Court at Law No. 4, Fort Bend County, Texas, granted defendant's motion to quash. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged under outdoor burning regulations promulgated by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) pursuant to the Texas Clean Air Act. The trial court found that the regulations, which banned outdoor burning except when no practical alternative existed, were unconstitutionally vague. The court of appeals disagreed. Defendant admitted that he and his company had a copy of the outdoor burning regulations but did not contact the TCEQ for clarification even though it was possible to do so before beginning the burn. Further, his testimony did not support a conclusion that an ordinary individual would fail to understand the law because it was too vague in describing the conduct it sought to deter. He explained in his testimony to the trial court that he considered logistics and costs in determining whether a practical alternative to burning existed, and he did not claim any lack of understanding about the requirement that he also take into consideration whether an alternative to outdoor burning was technologically or ecologically viable. In light of the statute, he considered and rejected alternatives like hauling and trench burning.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled nolo contendere to assault of a family member in the 230th District Court of Harris County, Texas. Defendant appealed, asserting the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment because the prior conviction used to enhance the charge was a violation of the Texas and United States Constitutions' prohibitions against ex post facto laws, and that his plea was jurisdictionally defective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with assaulting his former wife in 2000. The record established that defendant had been convicted of the offense of assault of a member of defendant's family in 1992. Thus, pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.01(b)(2) (2003), defendant's assault in the instant case constituted a third-degree felony. Citing a former Texas Court of Criminal Appeals decision, the appellate court noted that a conviction which occurred prior to the enactment of a statute providing for increased punishment upon a subsequent conviction could be used for enhancement purposes under the statute, and that such usage was not unconstitutional as being an ex post facto application of the statute. Accordingly, the enhanced penalty under &sect; 22.01(b)(2), (applied to the 2000 assault), did not constitute an ex post facto violation. Secondly, using defendant's previous family violence assault conviction to enhance his punishment did not constitute a second punishment of his prior conviction for double jeopardy purposes. Finally, because defendant's 1992 assault conviction could be used to enhance the current assault charge to a felony, the district was vested with jurisdiction over the case.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the trial court granted the State's motion to adjudicate guilt because he violated his probation, and sentenced him to 20 years' confinement. He also pled guilty to burglary of a habitation, and was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment. He appealed both judgments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended both guilty plea proceedings were unconstitutional. He contended Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.15 (Vernon Supp. 2002), which prescribed the procedure for guilty plea proceedings, violated his federal and state constitutional right to compulsory process. Because he appealed after his deferred adjudication was revoked and guilt was formally adjudicated, he waived the issue. Although he argued the constitutionality of art. 1.15 was a jurisdictional issue, there was no indication in the record, and he did not demonstrate his complaint fell within an exception to the rule that he had to appeal when deferred adjudication was first imposed. He presented no credible authority that his attack on the constitutionality of art. 1.15 equated to an attack on the trial court's jurisdiction over his original plea proceeding. Because his constitutional challenge could not be classified as a jurisdictional challenge, which could be raised for the first time after revocation of deferred adjudication, the appellate court had no jurisdiction to hear the merits of his complaint regarding the guilty plea proceeding for the burglary offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent hospital authority brought suit against petitioner hospital district to recover the costs of indigent health care. The trial court granted the hospital district's plea to the jurisdiction and motion to dismiss. The Court of Appeals for the Fourteenth District of Texas held that the &quot;sue and be sued&quot; language in Tex. Health and Safety Code &sect; 281.056(a) waived its governmental immunity. The hospital district appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital authority based its claim against the district on the Indigent Health Care and Treatment Act and the Texas Constitution. The supreme court considered whether the district was immune from suit by the authority to recover medical expenses for hospital care the authority rendered to indigent patients. The supreme court concluded that &sect; 281.056(a) did not, either by itself or in context, clearly and unambiguously waive the district's immunity to suit. Further, Tex. Const. art. IX, &sect; 4 did not waive the district's governmental immunity from suit. Contrary to the authority's argument, none of the statutes referenced by the authority clearly waived a hospital district's governmental immunity so it could be sued over how and when tax receipts were spent. If the supreme court were to hold that waiver of governmental immunity to suit could occur in the manner contended for by authority, the holding would be at odds with the Legislature's plainly expressed intent. The Legislature had not waived the district's immunity from suit either by specific statutory language or by implication from a constitutional and statutory framework.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the judgment of the intermediate appellate court and dismissed the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by indictment with arson, and the indictment included a hate crime enhancement. Defendant argued that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.014(a) (Supp. 2006), the hate crimes statute, was unconstitutional because it was vague when applied. Defendant asserted that the vagueness resulted in the failure to provide actual notice of what conduct was prohibited by the statute's terms, and that it failed to establish minimal guidelines for law enforcement. The appellate court ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting defendant's claim that the indictment was so vague and indefinite that it failed to place defendant on notice of the charge against him. The indictment stated that defendant intentionally selected the victim due to defendant's bias and prejudice against a group identified by national origin and ancestry to which the victim belonged. The victim's group was national origin or ancestry, which was a group explicitly recognized under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.014(a), the hate crime statute.</SPAN></P>

He was placed on two years deferred adjudication probation. Defendant appealed, contending the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a passenger in a car stopped by the police for violation of a noise ordinance, City of Austin, Tex., Municipal Code &sect; 10-5-40. A search of the car revealed alcohol, although both occupants were under the legal drinking age, and marijuana. A search of defendant revealed cocaine in his sock. Defendant moved to suppress the cocaine, contending it was the fruit of an illegal stop, because the noise ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The district court expressly concluded that the noise ordinance was neither vague nor overly broad, and denied the motion to suppress. Defendant then pleaded guilty, and appealed the denial of his motion to suppress. The court found that defendant had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the ordinance, and therefore the traffic stop, but affirmed the denial of his motion to suppress. The court held that the ordinance did not cover a substantial amount of U.S. Const. amend. I activity; therefore the court refused to strike it down at the behest of defendant complaining, not of restraint of speech, but that a restraint on the volume of his friend's non-speech led to the discovery of illegal substances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the refusal to suppress evidence and the order deferring adjudication because the noise ordinance did not cover a substantial amount of protected activity.</SPAN></P>

Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 5(b) (Supp. 2004).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Travis County, 200th Judicial District, Texas, granted summary judgment for appellees the Department of Licensing and Regulation and its director and the Commission on Licensing and Regulation and its members, on a claim by appellants, individuals in the business of eyebrow threading, that regulations unreasonably interfered with their right to economic liberty under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applying the directives of case law for reviewing regulations that were within the scope of the police power, the court concluded that, under either the real and substantial test or rational basis review, the state defendants established that they were entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. The evidence at most established that there was room for a fair difference of opinion as to the necessity and reasonableness of the challenged regulations. On the record, the challenged regulations were sufficiently rational and reasonable to meet constitutional due course requirements under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. There was no evidence to support a finding that the purpose of the regulation of the practices of cosmetology, including eyebrow threading, was economic protection or to prevent economic competition. The court also held that the state defendants' plea to the jurisdiction was properly denied. A declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of specific cosmetology statutes as applied to the practice of eyebrow threading could properly be asserted against the state defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife's executor sued appellee husband's executor, seeking a declaration that certain accounts and securities were not owned by the husband and wife with a right of survivorship. The husband's executor filed a counterclaim. The Probate Court No. 1, Harris County (Texas), granted the husband's executor partial summary judgment with respect to a brokerage account, another account, and certain securities. The wife's executor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The probate court erred in holding that the brokerage account created a right of survivorship because the account agreement did not satisfy Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 452. Specifically, the husband and wife failed to affirmatively select the paragraph in the agreement that would have created the account as held with a right of survivorship. As for the securities held in certificate form by the husband and wife, Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 450 could not be utilized to create a joint tenancy with right of survivorship in community property because the subsequently-enacted Part 3 of the Texas Probate Code, Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 451 et seq., provided the exclusive method for creating a right of survivorship in community property. Accordingly, the trial court erred in ruling that the securities were owned by the husband and wife with a right of survivorship pursuant to Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 450. Thus, the trial court erred in granting the husband's executor summary judgment as to ownership of the brokerage account and securities in certificate form.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed as to the other account as the wife's executor had not challenged the trial court's ruling s to that account. The judgment was  reversed as to the brokerage account and securities in certificate form.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 183rd District Court, Harris County, Texas, found defendant guilty of recklessly causing bodily injury to a child younger than 15 years of age, and answered affirmatively a special issue that he used a motor vehicle as a deadly weapon. The trial court assessed punishment at four years' confinement. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an argument regarding the complainant parking on the property of his business, defendant used his truck to move the complainant's car from his property. Upon impact, the complainant's minor son was thrown from the backseat through the open driver-side door and slid across the gravel parking lot sustaining injuries. On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain the conviction because he did not know that the child was in the car, and that it was unconstitutional to permit a deadly weapon finding for a motor vehicle unless the vehicle was purposefully used as a weapon against a person. The appellate court held that a rational trier of fact could have found defendant to have been aware of, but have consciously disregarded, the substantial risk that using his vehicle to move the complainant's car with a visible car seat and two adult occupants would result in bodily injury to anyone in the complainant's vehicle, including a child. The appellate court further held that a complaint that a statute was unconstitutional as applied because of vagueness had to be raised in the trial court in order to preserve error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer sought review of a summary judgment from the 250th District Court of Travis County (Texas), which ruled in favor of appellees, the Texas Health Insurance Risk Pool, the Texas Department of Insurance, and the Texas Commissioner of Insurance, in an action brought by the insurer to recover excessive payments to the Pool under former Tex. Ins. Code art. 3.77, &sect; 13. A cross-appeal raised issues of jurisdiction and attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer made errors in its reporting forms and did not seek a refund from the Pool until after the assessment period had closed. The Pool refused to provide a refund, stating that it lacked statutory authority to do so. The insurer filed suit seeking declaratory relief, an order requiring the Pool to repay the excessive assessments, and attorney fees. The trial court granted a plea to the jurisdiction filed by the Texas Department of Insurance and the Commissioner, entered a summary judgment against the insurer, and awarded attorney fees to all parties. The court held that the plea to the jurisdiction was properly granted because the insurer was seeking money damages and not declaratory relief. The trial court should also have granted the Pool's plea to the jurisdiction. The court rejected the insurer's constitutional challenge to former art. 3.77, concluding that the assessments did not constitute a tax and that the mistake did not rise to the level of a constitutional deprivation. The trial court abused its discretion under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 37.009 (1997) in awarding attorney fees to the insurer because the insurer did not prevail on any ground sought.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment with regard to the Texas Department of Insurance and the Commissioner, granted the Pool's cross-issue regarding jurisdiction, reversed the trial court's award of attorney fees to the insurer, and rendered judgment that the insurer take nothing.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court denied the motion for rehearing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the 204th Judicial District Court, Dallas County (Texas), which convicted her of felony prostitution, in violation of Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of felony prostitution. On appeal, defendant claimed that &sect; 43.02 was unconstitutional, as applied to her, because the statute impinged on her right to engage in consensual sexual activity, including commercial activity that might be related to consensual sexual activity. The court found that there was no fundamental constitutional right to engage in adult consensual sexual activity. Hence, a fundamental right of defendant was not implicated. Accordingly, an as-applied challenge to the constitutionality of the statute had to be preserved for appeal by first raising the issue at the trial court level. This, defendant failed to do.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Texas Commissioner of Education and others (State), challenged a decision of the 250th District Court of Travis County, Texas in favor of plaintiff school districts. The district court ruled that an ad valorem tax was a state tax when imposed directly by the State or the State controlled the levy and disbursement, and the tax violated Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1-e.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school districts contended that funding for school operations violated of Tex. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1 because children in property-poor districts did not have equal access to education revenue. The court affirmed in part and held that local ad valorem taxes had become a state property tax in violation of Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1-e. The court also held that individuals' standing to assert the constitutional claims did not deprive school districts of standing to assert the claims because the guarantee of public free schools assured by Tex. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1, extended to the public at large, which was vitally concerned that there be a general diffusion of knowledge. However, the Legislature did not act arbitrarily in structuring the public education system so that school districts were not able to afford all students the opportunity to accomplish a general diffusion of knowledge. But, the school finance system did violate Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1-e as Tex. Educ. Code Ann. &sect; 42.301 provided for local supplementation, and the State increased accreditation standards in an environment of increasing costs to tax at maximum rates, so the State was controlling local tax rates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court was reversed insofar as it declared a violation of the Texas Constitution's provision requiring all students to be provided opportunity to accomplish a general diffusion of knowledge. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The County Court at Law No. 1 of El Paso County, Texas, convicted defendant for criminal trespass after he attempted to collect signatures at a shopping mall to have a candidate added to the ballot and refused to leave when asked to do so. Defendant appealed, contending that the application of the criminal trespass statute in his case violated his right to free speech under U.S. Const. amend. I and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he had a right to free speech at the mall because the mall was the functional equivalent of a town square. The court found that, under United States Supreme Court caselaw, defendant had no First Amendment right to solicit signatures at a mall. Judicial enforcement of neutral trespass laws did not amount to state action. The court declined to find that the protection of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 was broader than the First Amendment in this regard. As with the First Amendment, state action was required before a person could maintain a claim for violation of art. I, &sect; 8, and there was no evidence to show that the operations of the mall could be fairly attributed to the government. Although the California free-speech provision was similar to that of Texas, the California Supreme Court did not rest a decision that its provision was broader than the First Amendment on an examination of the text or history of the provision. Therefore, that decision did not assist the court in interpreting art. I, &sect; 8. The record contained no evidence to support the assertion that downtowns were functionally dead or that there was an absence of public spaces to solicit signatures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant asserted Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

In the remainder of his issues, appellant asserted that because he was improperly admonished and received ineffective assistance of counsel, his plea was involuntary. Because Tex. R. App. P. 25.2(b)(3) applied, a timely notice of appeal that complied with the rule was necessary to invoke the appellate court's jurisdiction. Therefore, because appellant filed a general notice of appeal, his first issue was not reviewable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 268th District Court, Fort Bend County, Texas, convicted defendant of continuous sexual abuse of a child under the age of 14 and two counts of sexual assault, pursuant to a guilty plea. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash, which challenged the constitutionality of the statute criminalizing continuous sexual abuse of a child under the age of 14, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.02 (Supp. 2012). The appellate court noted that because it concluded that the language of &sect; 21.02 was clear and unambiguous, it did not consider extra-textual factors. The alternate acts of sexual abuse listed under &sect; 21.02(b) were all felonies involving the actual or intended sexual abuse of a young child. The alternate acts were morally equivalent and conceptually similar, and the legislature did not violate due process by treating the alternate acts as manner and means under &sect; 21.02. The statute clearly prohibited an individual from continuously sexually abusing a child under the age of 14 for a period of more than 30 days. Whether it prohibited multiple acts of sexual abuse committed over a shorter period had no bearing on the validity of the indictment at issue. The language of the statute provided sufficient guidance to law enforcement personnel that it was not so indefinite that it encouraged arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimed ownership of a real estate lot through a 2001 quitclaim deed, and asserted the claim in a lawsuit filed against appellees, who had acquired the lot in a tax sale. Although appellant described its claim as a cause of action to quiet title, the suit, in effect, was a challenge to the validity of the tax sale. The 410th District Court, Montgomery County, Texas, entered judgment for appellees, and appellant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The constable's deed from the tax sale was filed of record on June 19, 1996. Appellant did not obtain the quitclaim deed until 2001 and did not file suit against appellees until 2003. Neither appellant nor its predecessors-in-title filed suit within one year of the 1996 filing of the constable's deed, and appellant only paid taxes for 2002. The requirement of Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 33.54(a)(1) was not met. Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 33.54(b) did not apply because no tax payment was made by appellant's predecessors-in-title, or by appellant, during the applicable limitations period. The limitations provisions precluded appellant's claim. Although Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 33.54(b) provided a means of avoiding the bar of limitations, neither appellant nor its predecessors availed themselves of it. Additionally, although the court provided appellant with an opportunity to satisfy Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 34.08(a) requirements, appellant did not. Further, the failure to join all interested parties in the suit for delinquent taxes did not deprive the trial court of the power to render a valid judgment against those actually named.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother challenged a decision of the 65th District Court of El Paso County (Texas), which, on a petition filed by appellee Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, terminated the mother's parental rights to her child pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 161.001(1)(D), (E), (N), (O).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother raised many issues on appeal, but the court affirmed. Termination of the mother's rights was proper under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 161.001(1)(N) as constructive abandonment was shown. It was in the child's best interests that the mother's rights be terminated, given that (1) the mother did not participate in services offered, showed violent behavior, and made lackluster efforts to visit the child, (2) the mother lacked suitable housing and employment, and (3) the child had bonded with his foster parents, who were capable, unlike the mother, of meeting the child's medical needs. The mother had not established that Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 263.405(b) and (i) always had and would operate unconstitutionally. The court rejected the argument that the sections were facially unconstitutional. Because the mother had not alleged there were other complaints she would have raised but for the restrictions, she failed to show that the statute deprived her of due process rights. The court did not need to reach the constitutionality of &sect; 263.405 under the separation of power clause. The mother failed to show how the statute deprived her of the ability to raise certain challenges on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee gas utility company filed a petition in condemnation in the county civil court at law against appellant landowner; the landowner brought a tort action against the company in the 334th District Court, Harris County, Texas, and the company counterclaimed for condemnation. The cases were consolidated and transferred to the district court. The company was awarded the easement and the landowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the landowner challenged the summary judgment rendered by the county civil court at law in the company's favor in the condemnation action, and the second summary judgment rendered by the district court granting the company's motions in the landowner's trespass action. Given the exclusive jurisdiction over eminent domain proceedings specifically granted to the civil courts at law in Harris County under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 24.1032(c) (Vernon Supp. 2002), the appellate court concluded that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction on the company's condemnation counterclaims. Furthermore, the county civil court had jurisdiction to hear the landowner's trespass related claims, but its jurisdiction did not preclude the district court from hearing those claims. Nonetheless, the company established as a matter of law, that the landowner could not recover on his trespass claims. As the appellate court vacated the landowner's condemnation award, the company was the successful party on the only claims over which the district court had jurisdiction; thus, the landowner could not recover costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's judgment was affirmed as to the take nothing summary judgment in favor of the company on the landowner's trespass claims and awarded costs against the landowner. The district court's judgment granting the company its easement and awarding the landowner condemnation damages was vacated. The company's statutory eminent domain cause of action was transferred back to the county civil court.</SPAN></P>

The County Criminal Court No. 7. Dallas County, Texas, denied those motions, but four days into trial, it granted the original motion and dismissed the jury. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Among other acts, defendant allegedly followed the complainant without her knowledge, surreptitiously videotaping her as she went about her day.

He filed a motion to quash the indictment, alleging, in part, that the word &quot;following&quot; as used in the statute was too vague to be constitutional. The court disagreed, finding that the stalking statute was not unconstitutionally vague because a person who knew or reasonably believed his conduct would be regarded as threatening bodily injury or death was put on notice that his conduct was prohibited. The term &quot;following&quot; alleged in the indictment was not so broad as to encompass non-criminal activities. The court also held that quashing the indictment after trial began was not error where defendant had filed his motions before trial commenced, and the record did not show that the trial court considered anything other than the indictment as a pleading.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the 64th District Court of Hale County (Texas), which convicted her of interference with child custody in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 25.03(a)(1) (Supp. 2008).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a father were the parents of a daughter. Both acted as joint managing conservators for the child. Pursuant to a lower court order, the father had custody of the child from 9:00 a.m. each Saturday until 9:00 p.m. on Sunday. Such custody was not extended by defendant to the father on a particular Saturday. Instead, defendant rebuffed the father's attempt to acquire the child. As a result, the father contacted the police. On appeal, the court found that the State admitted into evidence an order describing the father's visitation. Other evidence showed that defendant had agreed to the terms and actually signed the order containing them, that the father took the order to the police after defendant refused to release the child, that the father informed the police that defendant would not release the child. The court held the evidence was sufficient for a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that an order or judgment disposing of the custody of the child had been knowingly violated by defendant. Finally, the court held that &sect; 25.03(a)(1) did not violate due process as it was no unconstitutionally vague on its face or as applied.</SPAN></P>

The truck left a parking lot at a high rate of speed and fishtailed at an intersection before turning onto another street. The truck drove across the front yard of a residence to avoid a roadblock. The truck then drove across a field before finally coming to a stop. The officer smelled alcohol on the 17-year-old driver's breath and noticed that his eyes were bloodshot and watery. The officer performed a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on the driver and observed four clues that suggested the driver was intoxicated. In addition, he found 11 cans of beer in the vehicle. The court held that Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect; 524.012 gave the driver fair notice of the type of conduct that would result in license suspension. The word &quot;detectable&quot; had a plain and ordinary meaning that could be understood by a person of ordinary intelligence. Given the totality of the circumstances, the officer did not arbitrarily detect alcohol in the driver's system but articulated several factors indicating he had alcohol in his system, which were all also commonly cited in driving while intoxicated cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was named as a gang member, and a permanent injunction was issued under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 125.065, which included a curfew. A police officer recognized defendant after the hours set forth in the curfew. He was arrested, a plea bargain was entered, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 71.021 (2003) was not overbroad under the First Amendment. It did not restrict a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct; the only conduct it restricted was a knowing violation of a court order. Moreover, it was not void for vagueness. The clear language of the statute would have given an individual in defendant's position clear notice that violating the curfew amounted to a criminal offense. Further, it was not arbitrarily applied; instead, it prevented arbitrary enforcement through the establishment of certain guidelines. Also, the separation of powers doctrine was not violated by &sect; 125.065. Finally, an issue relating to the constitutionality of the injunction's curfew provision was not preserved for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

Considering federal law imposed substantially similar requirements on inmates litigating in forma pauperis, the court concluded that Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.

The court held that &sect;&sect; 14.004(a), (b), 14.005(a), (b) did not violate the open courts provision of the Texas Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed three liens against property. It was held that the liens were not valid. When he refused to remove the liens, he was indicted for refusing to execute the release of a fraudulent lien or claim, in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 32.49(c) (2003). He was convicted of the Class A misdemeanor offense. He filed a petition for declaratory judgment, seeking to have the Texas Lien Release Law declared unconstitutional. The State moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motion. On appeal, the court found that appellant did not introduce any evidence of any collateral legal consequences that he had or would suffer as a result of his criminal conviction. He had an opportunity to challenge the validity of the Lien Release Law as a part of his criminal case, which he did not do. Under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 12.02 (2005), the statute of limitations for a misdemeanor was two years; hence, appellant was no longer subject to prosecution based on the notices to remove the liens. A &quot;naked&quot; declaration that the Lien Release Law was invalid, without a valid request for injunctive relief, was not within the jurisdiction of a district court sitting in equity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded guilty in the County Criminal Court No. 4, Dallas County (Texas) to driving while intoxicated. The trial court had denied his motion to suppress. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant raised various issues on appeal, but the court affirmed. An officer observed appellant violating Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect; 545.104(a), and because appellant made a left turn, the officer could have found that it was appellant's intention to make it. The officer was authorized to stop appellant. As the officer was authorized to stop appellant for failing to signal his left turn, whether he was authorized to stop appellant for an additional traffic violation under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect; 545.101(d) was immaterial to whether the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. Appellant did not cite to any portion of the record where he asserted that a statute was unconstitutionally vague, and thus the issue was not preserved for review. Because the record did not show that the trial court ever received a request by appellant to file findings of fact and conclusions of law in connection with his motion to suppress, the trial court did not err in failing to file them.</SPAN></P>
