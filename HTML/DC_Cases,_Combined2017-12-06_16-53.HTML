</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, defendant was found guilty of a single count of criminal contempt for failure to comply with a court order to pay child support, in violation of D.C. Code &sect; 46-225.02 (2001). The Superior Court of the District of Columbia sentenced defendant to 180 days in jail and ordered defendant to pay $ 50 into the Victims of Crime Compensation Fund. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the presumption of willfulness created by D.C. Code &sect; 46-225.02 violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Defendant also maintained that there was insufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to find defendant guilty of criminal contempt. The court of appeals held that D.C. Code &sect; 46-225.02 does not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proving willfulness from the government to the defendant, nor did the trial court shift the burden in this case. The appellate court further held that under &sect; 46-225.02, defendant bore the burden of production, or the presentation of evidence showing an inability to pay, but that, as usual, the government bore the burden of persuasion, that is, the burden of proving willfulness as an element of criminal contempt. The appellate court held that the government sustained its burden of proving willfulness under &sect;&nbsp;46-225.02 and that the evidence was sufficient to permit the trial court to find beyond a doubt that defendant voluntarily impaired defendant's ability to comply with the court order to pay child support and thus was guilty of contempt under &sect; 46-225.02.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia of one count of first-degree premeditated murder while armed, in violation of D.C. Code &sect; 22-2101 (2001 &amp; 2005 Supp.); three counts of first-degree felony murder while armed, in violation of D.C. Code &sect; 22-2101; possession of a firearm during a crime of violence; and three predicate felonies of armed robbery, kidnapping, and carjacking. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his accomplice abducted the victim, who had just received a money order as a rent payment, and drove away in the victim's car. Police officers, who were responding to a report of a shooting, came upon the victim's stolen car in an alley. The victim's body was lying in the back seat. He had been shot in the right side of his head and shoulder and also in his wrist and hand. Defendant was seen running from the area. A witness testified that defendant told him that the accomplice had unexpectedly shot the victim. On appeal, the court found that, because the government failed to present and the premeditated murder jury instruction failed to require the necessary proof of specific intent to kill and premeditation and deliberation by defendant, the first-degree premeditated murder conviction had to be reversed for insufficiency of the evidence. Further, defendant's conviction on the felony murder for the carjacking count had to be reversed, both because the natural and probable consequence instruction was improper with respect to that count and because the evidence that defendant had the specific intent to kill the victim was lacking.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions of first-degree premeditated murder and first-degree felony murder for carjacking were reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of the District of Columbia awarded permanent guardianship of appellant father's child to the child's maternal aunt and uncle under the Foster Children's Guardianship Act, D.C. Code &sect; 16-2381 et seq. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the child's mother stipulated to the child's neglect, she consented to the petition of the child's maternal aunt and uncle for permanent guardianship. The father objected. The appellate court held clear and convincing evidence did not have to support the order granting permanent guardianship as permanent guardianship, under D.C. Code &sect; 16-2388(f), did not finally terminate the father's parental rights. The child could inherit from him, and he could visit the child, except as limited by the court, consent to the child's adoption, and decide the child's religious affiliation, and had a responsibility for support, under D.C. Code &sect; 16-2389(c). He could move to terminate the guardianship at any time. The guardians' legal rights to the child expired on her eighteenth birthday. Use of the preponderance of the evidence standard was proper. The factors in D.C. Code &sect; 16-2383(d) were properly applied. It was no abuse of discretion for the trial court not to ask the child her wishes. The trial court did not bar the father's visitation, and D.C. Code &sect; 16-2389(d) did not require the court to specify the frequency of that visitation, so a failure to do so did not abuse discretion.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 22-4504(a) (2001). Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers responded to a radio call reporting that men were smoking marijuana in a parked automobile. One officer approached defendant driver and asked him to roll own the automobile's window. When the driver complied, the officer smelled marijuana. The other officer asked defendant passenger, whose knees were up against the glove compartment of the automobile, to exit the vehicle. When the passenger exited the vehicle, the glove compartment door fell open revealing a fully loaded revolver with a piece of rubber tubing lying across the latch. The tubing prevented the latch, which worked properly in later tests, from locking the door. Neither defendant had a license to carry a pistol. On appeal, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to establish constructive possession of the pistol as the jury by using its own common sense could conclude that, regardless of who put it there, the rubber tubing kept the glove compartment from latching properly. Further, the jury was not required to engage in any impermissible or cumulative speculation in determining that the passenger was purposely holding the glove compartment door shut with his knees to keep the pistol hidden.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An inspector for respondent District of Columbia Department of Health issued a notice of infraction to petitioner owner for the failure to properly containerize solid waste in violation of D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 21, &sect; 700.3. The owner petitioned to reverse a $ 1,125 fine imposed under D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 16, &sect; 3216.1 by an administrative law judge (ALJ) of the Office of Administrative Hearings (District of Columbia).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner argued that its due process right to notice was violated by the dual schedules under D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 21, &sect; 1380.2 and D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 16, &sect; 3216.1 for civil fines for violations of D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 21, &sect; 700.3. The appellate court held that the owner was on constructive notice of the existence of both schedules and the underlying act that triggered their imposition. The existence of an alternate penalty scheme did not vitiate the notice that a violator might be subject to either fine. The dual penalty provisions were not impermissibly vague. Section 700.3 unambiguously provided for containerized storage of solid wastes and was sufficiently clear to put an ordinary person on notice of what was and was not permitted. Further, the property manager had actual knowledge of the regulation. Finally, strict liability was not improper and due process was not offended by a $ 1,300 fine for failing to containerize solid waste. The fine imposed on property owners for failing to containerize solid waste was not a set, static amount. Property owners were free to present, and the ALJ was free to consider, mitigating factors that might reduce the imposed fine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant trustees of a congressionally chartered children's charity appealed from a grant of summary judgment, by the District of Columbia Superior Court, in favor of plaintiff directors, after that court determined, on remand, that the Act of May 24, 1828, ch. 88, 6 Stat. 381 (1828) (the charter), chartering the charity, created a dual governance system, declared that the trustees had violated that system, and ordered equitable relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board of trustees of a children's charity that had existed since 1815 and incorporated under congressional charter in 1828 unilaterally accepted the District of Columbia Nonprofit Corporation Act, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 29-301.01 et seq. (2001), and received a certificate. In the exercise of the powers purportedly bestowed thereunder, they sought to abolish the charity's board of directors, successors to the women who had originally founded the charity and had not been able to incorporate it, at the time, due to married women's former legal disabilities. After an earlier remand, in which the court had directed it to resolve ambiguities in the charter, the trial court had, as directed, examined contemporaneous documents from the period 1816-1828, as well as the parties' course of dealing over nearly 200 years, and found it was clear that the charter envisioned dual governance, with the trustees handling the property that the directors were legally precluded from handling, but with the directors running the charity. No later unilateral action by the trustees could change the charter, and they were not entitled to payment of legal fees for their attempts to circumvent it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that there was not probable cause to conduct the warrantless search and seizure that preceded his arrest, and therefore the evidence obtained from the search should have been suppressed. The appellate court found no error, noting first that the basis of the informant's knowledge was grounded in his own direct observations of the drug sale he reported witnessing. In addition, the informant had worked for the police for approximately 20 years, previously provided accurate information, was continuously employed, and remained out of the criminal justice system. In addition, the police were able to independently corroborate the informant's story. Under the circumstances, the appellate court concluded that defendant's arguments that there was no probable cause because the yellow hood the informant described him as wearing during the drug sale was in fact part of his jacket, as opposed to a separate article of clothing, was inconsequential. So too was defendant's argument based on lack of testimony about how far away the informant was when he observed the drug deal, and the informant's inability to say where on defendant's person the drugs could be found.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found petitioner guilty of second-degree burglary. The trial court found him guilty of the misdemeanor counts of second-degree theft and destruction of property. In ruling on those counts, the trial court found that a co-defendant stole some or all of the personal property belonging to the complaining witnesses and that at a minimum, petitioner aided and abetted the co-defendant's activities. The court also found that either or both defendants broke the window that was the basis of the destruction of property charge. Petitioner then filed a post-conviction petition for a writ of error coram nobis to challenge the prosecutor's closing argument comment that petitioner had exercised his right not to testify and defense counsel's failure to move for a mistrial based on that comment. The trial court denied it. On appeal, the appellate court first found that his petition was not one to vacate his sentence pursuant to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 23-110 (2001), as he had originally styled it, as he could not show he met the requirement of being in custody. It then found that he was not entitled to writ of error coram nobis relief since he had not even alleged any errors of fact.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District of Columbia Superior Court entered judgment on a jury verdict convicting defendant of aggravated assault while armed in violation of D.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 22-504.1 and 22-3202 (1981), recodified as D.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 22-404.01 and 22-4502 (2001), and related offenses. Defendant appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the jury was improperly instructed on the elements of the assault offense and that the evidence was insufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Witnesses to defendant's repeated stabbing of the victim provided ample evidence of the great pain that was caused, and evidence at trial demonstrated extreme and permanent disfigurement. Nonetheless, defendant was entitled to a new trial on the charge of aggravated assault while armed because the definition of the essential element of &quot;serious bodily injury&quot; provided in answer to a jury question was impermissibly broader than the formulation that the court had adopted in its decision in Nixon v. United States, while defendant's appeal was pending. Since there was a chance that jurors had convicted defendant in reliance on that broader definition, reversal was required. Nonetheless, the fact that the evidence would have been legally sufficient if only the jury had been properly instructed meant that a new trial was permissible, if the government decided to proceed with it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's other convictions but reversed the conviction of aggravated assault while armed, and remanded the matter for a new trial on that count.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after officers observed him urinating on the front bumper of a broken down parked van. The officers then searched defendant and found two plastic bags in his front pants pocket. The bags contained marijuana residue. On appeal, defendant argued that his arrest was unlawful because it was for a civil infraction. The appellate court concluded that the arresting officer's alleged mistake of law was immaterial because, regardless of his actual reason for making the arrest, the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant for committing a misdemeanor offense in his presence. The officer had probable to arrest defendant for disorderly conduct in violation of D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-1321 (2001) and for defacing public property in violation of D.C. Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;22-3312.01. In addition, the appellate court noted that the officer's subjective belief made no difference because the test was an objective one. Thus, because the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant, the search incident to his arrest was reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment on jury verdict of the District of Columbia Superior Court convicting him, after a second trial, of possession of an unregistered firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition. He had been acquitted of more serious charges. Although he challenged the constitutionality of the two statutes, his appeal focused on claims that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated by certain evidentiary rulings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An important witness at defendant's second trial on charges arising out of a fatal shooting had a history of mental illness. He had been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic years earlier, but professionals who treated him later indicated that many of the symptoms probably had been due to his former use of hallucinogenic drugs. He had not experienced delusions in many years. The trial court had allowed cross-examination of the witness regarding his mental problems, as this could be a legitimate factor in evaluating credibility, but it had not allowed paranoid schizophrenia to be mentioned nor had it allowed a defense expert to testify regarding that diagnosis based on a determination that the term itself was too prejudicial to use in relation to a witness whose diagnosis was doubtful. Under those circumstances, the rulings were not abuses of discretion, nor did they deny defendant his rights of confrontation and to present a defense. Defendant had also belatedly challenged the constitutionality of the statutes he had been convicted of violating, but the court was bound by precedent upholding the statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, defendant was found not guilty of premeditated murder and assault with intent to kill while armed, but convicted of the lesser-included offenses of involuntary manslaughter while armed and assault with a deadly weapon. He was also convicted of carrying a pistol without a license and three counts of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The argument calling the jury's attention to defendant's actions that placed one individual and her infant son in harm's way tended to arouse the passions of the jury. However, given the brevity of the prosecutor's remarks, their context, and the strength of the government's case, the appellate court was persuaded that any error was harmless. Defendant's other objections to the prosecutor's arguments also failed. In addition, before the defense rested, defense counsel requested the trial court's permission to read to the jury from a treatise, citing as authority Fed. R. Evid. 803(18), which appeared to be consistent with District of Columbia law. The appellate court found that the attention-calling requirement under Rule 803(18) was not adequate to permit admission of the material as substantive evidence because counsel did not call the expert's attention to the pages of the treatise from which he sought to read and the expert had no opportunity to explain any differences and their significance, if any, to the issue or to identify other portions of the text that might have been relevant to his position. Thus, the trial court properly found that the evidence was not admissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court remanded with instructions for the trial court to vacate two of defendant's convictions for possession of a firearm during a crime of violence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which convicted defendant of violating the Pit Bull and Rottweiler Dangerous Dog Designation Emergency Amendment Act of 1996 (Pit Bull Act), D.C. Act 11-257, 43 D.C. Reg. 2156 (Apr. 16, 1996), amending D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 6-1021.6(b) (1995), re-codified at D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 8-1906(b) (2001).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with owning pit bulls that attacked a neighbor without provocation. Defendant's trial strategy was to focus on the absence of evidence establishing that the attack was unprovoked. On appeal, defendant argued that the Pit Bull Act, which augmented the penalty for owning a pit bull that caused injury to include a $ 20,000 fine and two-year term of imprisonment, violated due process. The court held that the Pit Bull Act was not void for vagueness because the Act, by focusing on the ownership of two specific breeds, unprovoked attacks, and injury in fact, criminalized a narrow range of conduct that was easily understood. The language of the Act did not indicate a culpable mental state for the offense, and a culpable mental state requirement was not consistent with the Act's purpose to establish a public welfare offense based on the dangerous potential of the two breeds. The Act created a constitutional strict liability felony that required the government to show that defendant knew that he owned a pit bull. In light of the trial court's curative instructions, defendant was not prejudiced by the prosecutor's statement that the jury need only read the newspaper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, individuals and the District of Columbia, appealed from an order of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia dismissing their action against defendants, manufacturers, importers, and distributors of firearms (manufacturers), in which they sought damages under various tort theories and under the District of Columbia Assault Weapon Manufacturing Strict Liability Act of 1990, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 7-2551.01 et seq. (2001).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individuals, including both victims and survivors of dead victims, and the District sued the manufacturers under the Act but also under traditional tort theories of negligence, strict liability, and public nuisance. The appellate court agreed with the trial court and with courts of other jurisdictions that imposing tort liability on the manufacturers despite the complete legality of their actual activities would stretch traditional concepts of foreseeability too far. This finding was reinforced by the legislative decision, in enacting the Act, to impose strict liability only in the case of assault weapons, although such weapons were relatively broadly defined. The Act, which was a reasonable exercise of the District's police power not violative of the Commerce Clause or Due Process, provided causes of action only to individuals, although the District might be able to exercise statutory subrogation rights in certain cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed dismissal of the tort counts as to all plaintiffs. It reversed dismissal of the statutory count as to the individuals but affirmed as to the District, except as to any claims it might bring based on a theory of statutory subrogation for expenses it had incurred on behalf of individual victims.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court's consideration of this issue, however, was limited to plain error review because defendant did not adequately present the statutory claim, as distinct from one under the First Amendment, to the trial judge. Applying plain error analysis to the RFRA claim, the appellate court rejected defendant's argument, noting that judicial precedent precluded an argument that the government's compelling interest in interdicting drugs could leave room for religious use of marijuana. The fact that defendant cited scarce decisional authority favoring relaxed enforcement in order to accommodate religious use fell short of meeting defendant's burden under the plain error standard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant tenants' association challenged an order from the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which granted summary judgment to appellees, a partnership, a general partner, and a university, on the association's claims alleging that a sale by the partnership to the university of an ownership interest in an apartment complex violated the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase and Sale Act of 1980 (TOPA), D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 42-3404.02 (2001).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The partnership executed an agreement with the university to sell approximately 28 percent of its interest in an apartment complex where the association's members lived. The association filed a complaint, alleging that the deal constituted a master lease under D.C. Code &sect; 42-3404.02(c) and thereby violated the TOPA since the tenants were not provided an opportunity to buy the property before the sale. On cross-motions for summary judgment, judgment was entered upholding the agreement. On appeal, the association contended that the superior court misconstrued &sect; 42-3404.02 in finding that the deal was not a sale. The court found that the agreement was not a sale under the TOPA. Since the agreement clearly covered only a partial interest, the partnership did not relinquish possession of the complex. There was no change in fundamental control of ownership to satisfy &sect; 42-3404.02(b)(1). No option to purchase an ownership interest was granted, so &sect; 42-3404.02(b)(5) was also not satisfied. The failure to meet either statutory factor for a sale meant the agreement was not a &quot;master lease&quot; under &sect; 42-3404.02(c). Consequently, the partnership's duty under &sect; 402 of the TOPA never arose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the partnership, the general partner, and the university.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were tried jointly before a jury in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and all convicted of first-degree burglary while armed, first-degree felony murder while armed, first-degree premeditated murder while armed, assault with intent to kill while armed, aggravated assault while armed, and two counts of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The two major arguments made by defendants on appeal were that the indictment for burglary whiled armed was constructively amended by the trial court's instructions on intent in response to a jury note, and the introduction of an inculpatory statement of one defendant made to police violated the rights of the other three defendants under the Confrontation Clause. The appellate court concluded that there was no constructive amendment of the indictment on an essential element of the offense when the trial court gave an instruction that advised the jury as to how to evaluate the circumstantial evidence of intent. Although hardly overwhelming, the proof was at least minimally sufficient to show that, inter alia, defendants knew the victim was in the house at three in the morning when defendants entered the home. As for the admission of one defendant's statement to police, under plain error review, the appellate court concluded that any error in the admission of the statement did not affect the outcome based on the evidence implicating all four defendants. Among other things, the appellate court also noted that the first-degree and felony murder convictions should have been merged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded to vacate the felony murder count with respect to each defendant. In all other respects, the judgments of the trial court were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant owned a janitorial company and allegedly sexually abused one of his employees by putting a vacuum hose up her dress and touching her breasts at various times. Upon his arrest for such charges, marijuana was found by the police in his car. Defendant argued on appeal that he should have been granted a jury trial because of the additional penalties of deportation and having to register as a sex offender that would have been imposed if he were convicted of misdemeanor sexual abuse. He maintained that the availability of those penalties changed the nature of his offense from petty to serious and, therefore, required a jury trial. The court disagreed and held that he was not subject to deportation for the charged offense and, even if he were subject to such a penalty, the administrative or collateral consequences of a conviction did not implicate the right to a jury trial. The court found no prejudice to defendant as a result of the information giving a range of dates as opposed to specific dates, as the document included all of the necessary elements. Defendant's acts of touching the victim's genitalia with a vacuum hose established a sexual act or contact.</SPAN></P>

These included the reason for its decision to vacate the entry of default against the wife, the question of ownership of the $ 14,500 principal paid into the court registry, and whether the owner and his wife had consented to a partition of their marital property which they acquired as tenants by the entireties, and if they did consent, what their relative equities were in the property, and the determination of how much interest, if any, was earned on the $ 14,500 principal sum.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that his conviction for cruelty to children should be vacated because that offense merged with simple assault. Alternatively, defendant argued the rule of lenity demanded that his cruelty conviction be vacated. The appellate court concluded that the two offenses did not merge because each required an element of proof that the other did not. Further, lenity did not apply because the two offenses were separate and distinct offenses, and D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 23-112 established a clear intent to impose consecutive sentences for two or more offenses arising out of a single criminal act. Defendant also argued that he was denied his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to due process and a speedy trial because 12 months passed between the incident for which he was charged and his trial. The appellate court found no Sixth Amendment violation as only four and one-half months elapsed between defendant's arrest and his trial and that was not unreasonable given the normal processing time of a case. Nor was there any Fifth Amendment violation as there was no evidence the Government deliberately sought to hinder the defense or acted recklessly in failing to timely arrest defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion in limine to admit expert testimony on the lack of correlation between the confidence in and accuracy of eyewitness identifications. The appellate court found no abuse of discretion, noting that the eyewitness testimony at issue was corroborated by other evidence and the studies relied on by the proffered expert dealt with stranger identification rather than non-stranger identification as was the case in the instant action. Defendant also contended that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated by the admission of statements he made to a government witness while the two were confined in a courthouse holding cell because the statements were deliberately elicited by the government through its agent. After reviewing the record, the appellate court found that the Government did not deliberately elicit from defendant statements implicating him in the charged murder and actually took steps to ensure no contact between defendant and the witness occurred.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants contended that SORA inflicted punishment and therefore violated the Ex Post Facto, Double Jeopardy, and Due Process Clauses of the Constitution in its application to persons who committed sex offenses before its enactment or were acquitted of sex offenses by reason of insanity. Defendants further contended that even if it was not viewed as a penal enactment, SORA deprived them of procedural and substantive due process by denying them individualized hearings on whether they were dangerous and by infringing on their fundamental rights and liberty interests. The appellate court concluded that, inter alia, SORA was not punitive in nature, and therefore did not inflict punishment on defendants in violation of the aforementioned constitutional protections. One defendant also claimed that the trial court denied him procedural due process by assigning the burden of persuasion to him instead of to the government when he sought judicial review of an administrative determination that he was subject to lifetime registration rather than 10-year registration. The appellate court agreed, and held that the government was required to prove that the one defendant's acts were forcible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The orders of the trial court requiring defendants to register as sex offenders were affirmed. One defendant's case was remanded for further proceedings in which the government will bear the burden of persuasion as to the determination made by the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency that he must register as a Class A offender rather than a Class B offender.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the District of Columbia and nine individuals, challenged the decision of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which dismissed their suit against defendants, manufacturers and distributors of firearms, alleging negligent distribution, public nuisance, and strict liability under the Assault Weapon Manufacturing Strict Liability Act of 1990 (SLA), D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 7-2551.01 et seq. (2001).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that the manufacturers and distributors contributed to the unchecked illegal flow of firearms into the District. Affirming in part and reversing in part, the court held that (1) plaintiffs had not stated a claim for common-law negligence that met the heightened showing of foreseeability required to hold one responsible for an intervening criminal act involving the discharge of weapons; (2) the court was unwilling to recognize a claim for common-law public nuisance that disregarded, or greatly diluted, the liability-limiting factors necessary to state a claim for negligence; (3) the SLA conferred a right of action on individuals who were injured, but not the District of Columbia, except to the limited extent that the District sought subrogation under the Health-Care Assistance Reimbursement Act of 1984, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 4-601 et seq. (2001), for specific medical expenses incurred by it for the treatment of individual named plaintiffs; (4) at this stage of the litigation, the individuals were not required to identify the weapons that caused their injuries; and (5) the SLA did not burden interstate commerce or violate due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the dismissal of the statutory count for strict liability as to the individual plaintiffs and it reversed the dismissal of the strict liability count as to the District of Columbia to the extent -- but only the extent -- that it sought subrogated damages as to named individual plaintiffs for whom it had incurred medical expenses. The court otherwise sustained the judgment of the trial court and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia convicting her of carrying a pistol without a license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that due process was violated because the United States was enforcing a statute,&nbsp;&sect; 22-4504(a), that the executive branch believed was unconstitutional as violative of the Second Amendment based on a memorandum issued by the Attorney General. The memorandum referred to a Fifth Circuit opinion that asserted that the Second Amendment protected the private right of individuals to possess and bear firearms, subject to reasonable restrictions. The government responded that defendant's premise was flawed because the government's present position was that &sect; 22-4504(a) was not unconstitutional either facially or as applied to defendant. The court found no basis to dispute the government's assertion and upheld defendant's conviction. The court further found no merit in defendant's alternative argument that the government's position resulted in uneven enforcement of &sect; 22-4504(a), because defendant failed to make a prima facie showing that others similarly situated were not prosecuted or that the alleged selective prosecution was improperly motivated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner university sought review of an order of respondent District of Columbia Board of Zoning Adjustment imposing certain conditions on its approval of a campus land use plan. It argued that the conditions violated the District of Columbia Human Rights Act, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 2-1401.01 et seq., that the conditions were arbitrary, capricious, and irrational, and that they amounted to unauthorized rezoning.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For 80 years the university's encroachment on a residential neighborhood had been a source of concern. Successive revisions of the District of Columbia's comprehensive land use plan emphasized the importance of housing as many undergraduates on campus as possible, and the Board issued an order setting specific goals for the period 2001 to 2009. An earlier challenge by the university on constitutional grounds had failed in a federal appeals court, so the university sought judicial review of the administrative decision. The court agreed with the university that students were protected against housing discrimination under the Human Rights Act, but further held that the Act had to be applied in harmony with the zoning regulations and the comprehensive plan, since these were enacted by the same legislative body that enacted the Act, so that in accordance with the comprehensive plan, it was acceptable to set target levels of student population that a neighborhood could absorb. A few conditions were invalid, notably one that threatened the university's access to redress, and another that de facto rezoned an area where dormitories were legal into one where they were not.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed most of the Board's order, but reversed it as to two conditions, and further stayed action on a third condition closely related to the invalid conditions. It remanded the matter to the Board for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

After the owner filed an exception and the protestors filed a reply, another hearing was held and the final denial order was entered. The owner sought review and the court affirmed, holding that the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel did not preclude re-evaluation of the license application because each renewal constituted a new factual transaction to be reviewed pursuant to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 25-104(b) (2001). There was no due process violation of the owner's rights because all of the procedures set out in D.C.

Lastly, the court found that the time limitations for issuing the decision under &sect; 25-106(c)(6) were directory only, and accordingly there was no issue as to the timeliness of its issuance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As was his custom, when the House of Representatives was about to debate an appropriations bill for the District of Columbia, defendant, a District resident who felt strongly about the District's lack of voting representation in Congress, stood in the gallery and began to shout to the Speaker, seeking recognition. The evidence disagreed about whether this happened during a lull, but it was clear that the House was in session and that defendant refused to stop shouting when asked. He was eventually ejected and arrested. The appellate court adhered to an earlier determination that the statute was not unconstitutional. The First Amendment did not guarantee the Houses of Congress as a forum for District residents while allowing limitations on the behavior of citizens of the states. The only equal protection violation that defendant claimed to protest was the denial of congressional representation; since that denial was provided for in the Constitution, and the Constitution could not violate itself, equal protection was not implicated. The evidence was ample to show that defendant violated the statute, and he had not been prejudiced by the prosecutor's arguable improprieties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Boy Scouts of America and the National Capital Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America, appealed from an order of the District of Columbia Commission on Human Rights holding that the Boy Scouts violated the District of Columbia Human Rights Act of 1977 (HRA), D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 2-1401.01 et seq. (2001), by denying adult membership to intervenors, two gay men denied adult membership on the basis of their sexual orientation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principal issues were whether the HRA barred the Boy Scouts from excluding the men from leadership positions and whether application of the HRA violated the Scouts' First Amendment freedom of expressive association. The appellate court assumed, without deciding, that the HRA applied and held that the men were properly excluded. The Commission erred in reviewing the Boy Scouts' position statements and exclusionary policy. The men's argument that neither the Scout Oath nor Scout Law expressed a viewpoint on the morality of homosexual conduct was rejected. Absent a demonstrated change in the Boy Scouts' official position, the Commission was precluded from reviewing the Scouts' position based on witnesses before it. The Boy Scouts' official position on homosexual conduct had been determined to be sufficient for First Amendment purposes in Dale. The men were open and honest about their sexuality and were leaders in the homosexual community, which was relevant for the limited purpose of assessing whether their presence would significantly burden the Boy Scouts' right not to accept members who derogated from the organization's expressive message.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate cases consolidated for appeal, appellant/appellee insureds sought, in the District of Columbia Superior Court, personal injury protection coverage of medical expenses arising from automobile accidents. In one case, the trial court granted appellee insurer's motion to dismiss, and appellant insureds sought review. In the other case, the trial court granted appellee insureds' summary judgment motion, and appellant insurer sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer argued the insureds had to exhaust protection through their health maintenance organizations (HMOs) before using personal injury protection coverage. The appellate court held an interpretation of D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 31-2406(g) (2001) was required. HMOs were not &quot;insurers&quot; under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 31-2402(11). However, the statutory scheme regulating HMOs strongly suggested the legislature intended to view HMOs as a source of insurance coverage. HMOs were regulated under the District of Columbia's Code's Insurance and Securities title, D.C. Code Ann. tit. 31, where the provisions relating to HMOs were addressed in subtit. IV, entitled &quot;Health and Related Insurance.&quot; HMOs had to (1) obtain a certificate of authority from the Commissioner of Insurance and Securities; (2) receive prior approval of contracts from the commissioner; and (3) have rates approved by the commissioner. HMOs had to pay into the Insurance Regulatory Trust Fund, under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 31-1202, and were defined as an insurer in D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 31-1601(7) (2001), a health insurer in D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 31-3301.01(22), and as providing health insurance policies in D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 31-2901(4).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant individual appealed several orders of a judge of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals relating to civil and criminal contempt, which found that the individual disregarded several injunctions issued by the court against the unauthorized practice of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1987, an injunction was issued to prevent the individual from representing himself as a lawyer. In 1995, a civil contempt order was issued against the individual for his continued violations. In 1997, a criminal contempt order was issued. The individual argued that the adjudications exceeded the court's authority to regulate his conduct, in particular his business of representing persons before federal and local administrative agencies. The court sustained the contempt orders in all respects and upheld the order directing the individual to pay partial attorney fees of members of the District of Columbia Committee on Unauthorized Practice of Law (CUPL), which sought to enforce the court's prior injunction. The court concluded that the individual's challenge was barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel. In addition, the injunction was well within the court's inherent and exclusive authority to define and regulate the practice of law in the District of Columbia. The government also presented sufficient evidence to warrant a finding of criminal contempt. Finally, there was no conflict of interest or appearance sufficient to prohibit an award of attorney fees to the CUPL.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 40-716(b)(2) (1998), recodified at D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 50-2201.05(b)(2) (2001), by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia in a bench trial. He was found not guilty of driving while intoxicated (DUI), former D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 40-716(b)(1) (1998), recodified at D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 50-2201.05(b)(1) (2001).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that: (1) the DUI and OWI statutes were not different in material respects and required the same verdict; and (2) the OWI statute was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court refused to consider the appeal under the plain error standard. Under the OWI statute, the question was whether the accused was so affected by the consumption of alcohol that it impaired his ability to operate a motor vehicle. This determination was a question of fact. There was sufficient evidence to support the conviction. Defendant admitted having several beers. His eyes were watery, and he could not perform the walking test without swaying. The two arresting officers opined that he was intoxicated. The trial court found that the refusal to take the breath test evidenced defendant's consciousness of guilt. Further, the OWI statute was not unconstitutionally vague. An understanding of the OWI statute did not leave interpretation to guesswork. The accused could reasonably understand that the conduct in which he engaged was proscribed by the statute. Nor was the statute rendered vague because of the claim that the DUI and OWI statutes proscribed the same conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction of aggravated assault while armed in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. Defendant also appealed from the denial of his motions for a new trial, and to vacate his sentence, which were consolidated with his direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant produced an affidavit from an official of the court allegedly convicting him of a prior assault, which refuted the prosecution's evidence. The appellate court, in a per curiam opinion, held, inter alia, that it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to rule that the government sufficiently established the assault conviction. The newly obtained affidavit could have been obtained prior to the conclusion of the trial, defeating the new trial motion. Given that the victim acknowledged a motive for blaming defendant falsely and was unsure as to who had stabbed her, and that her father seemed confused as to the identity of defendant, a legitimate question existed as to whether defendant was prejudiced by his trial counsel's failure to uncover the affidavit in time for the trial. On remand of the D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 23-110 (1996) motion, the trial court was advised to consider whether, in light of the affidavit, it was still convinced that the Government had proven the prior assault conviction by a preponderance of the evidence, and, if not, whether the failure to obtain the affidavit resulted in prejudice within the meaning of Strickland's second prong.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent District of Columbia Board of Education began proceedings to revoke the charters of petitioner charter schools.

The charter schools petitioned for review of the board's decision. The charter schools' cases were consolidated, and the board's proceedings were stayed at that time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charter schools argued that they had a statutory right to a contested case hearing based on the language of the District of Columbia Administrative Procedures Act, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 1-1509 (1999) (current version at D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 2-509 (2001)). In the alternative, they argued that they had a constitutional right to a contested case hearing because only such a hearing would provide them with the procedural safeguards required by the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. V. The court found that neither the District of Columbia School Reform Act of 1995, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 38-1800.02 et seq. (2001), nor the due process clause required a contested case hearing before the final revocation of the charters for the charter schools. The statutory procedures and those adopted by the board for the charter revocation proceedings were sufficiently fair and reliable to pass constitutional muster as both charter schools were well informed as to the basis for the revocation decisions and were provided with an opportunity to address these specific findings through both oral and written testimony and written submissions during the informal hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a financial crisis in the government of the District of Columbia, the United States Congress enacted the Omnibus Consolidated Rescission and Appropriations Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321-102 (1996), which declared that the District's financial managers served at the pleasure of the chief financial officer. When that officer terminated a number of employees, soon after announcing that he would be terminating those who lacked critical skills, they sued the District. The appeals court held that the statute had transformed them into employees at will, without civil service due process protections. Because they alleged that the manner of their firings precluded them from obtaining any future employment, even though they were not fired for fault, the employees did state a claim for defamation-based due process violations. Finally, the employees' complaint was simply insufficient to state a claim that they were fired in violation of their rights of free speech and association.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The seven-year old victim complained that defendant, her mother's fiance, had sexual contact with her on various occasions and threatened to injure her. The appellate court held that both the victim and her mother were potentially critical defense witnesses. The trial court's concern about a mini-trial and jury confusion would have been alleviated through a limited voir dire examination outside the presence of the jury. The victim's recantation of an alleged prior sexual assault, by itself, was insufficient to show that the prior accusation was false. The Government proffered evidence that the victim had recanted a prior sexual assault allegation because she was afraid of her mother and defendant. Nevertheless, prejudicial error could result in limiting defendant's Sixth Amendment right to cross-examine the victim since the Government could not prove his guilt without her testimony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The judgment was vacated and the case was remanded for resentencing. On other grounds, convictions were affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia entered a judgment convicting defendant of armed robbery under D.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 22-2901, -3202, -3901(a) (1996), first degree murder while armed under D.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 22-2401, -3202 (1996), and several other offenses related to the homicide of an elderly woman. The trial court sentenced defendant to life without parole. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that his sentence should be vacated because former D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-2404.1 (1996), and the trial court's implementation of it, violated the principles set forth in Apprendi. The appellate court held that there were circumstances under which former D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-2404.1 (1996) could be reconciled with Apprendi, namely, where an offender's eligibility for life without parole (LWOP) had been determined on the basis of a jury finding beyond a reasonable doubt that one of the enumerated aggravating factors existed. In the instant case, the jury found defendant guilty of first degree felony murder predicated on robbery, pursuant to former D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-2404.1(b)(8) (1996). However, the trial judge exercised her discretion to sentence defendant to LWOP based upon her understanding that three aggravating factors (namely, former D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-2404.1(b)(4), (8), (10) (1996)), not one, made him eligible for that sentence. The trial judge's consideration of two of those aggravating factors, without a corresponding jury finding beyond a reasonable doubt, was error, and one that seriously affected the fairness of defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence of life without parole was vacated, and the case was remanded for resentencing. In light of the prosecution's concession that defendant's two murder convictions should merge, and that defendant's convictions for felony murder and the predicate offense of armed robbery should merge, the trial court was instructed to vacate the appropriate convictions on remand. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of aggravated assault. His motion for judgment of acquittal was denied, by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which entered judgment. Defendant appealed, alleging error because the trial judge failed to define the element of &quot;serious bodily injury,&quot; as it appeared in the aggravated assault statute, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-504.1 (1996); D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-404.01 (2001).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court instructed the jury on the elements of aggravated assault, but did not provide a definition of &quot;serious bodily injury.&quot; At trial, there was no objection to the instructions, and defendant did not offer an instruction defining &quot;serious bodily injury.&quot; The appellate court found the record did not support the preservation of instructional error, and therefore the claim of error was reviewed under the plain error standard. Although concluding it was error not to define &quot;serious bodily injury,&quot; the evidence of guilt was strong and compelling beyond a reasonable doubt. The instructions actually given were sufficiently complete. The failure to define &quot;serious bodily injury&quot; did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings, and there was no miscarriage of justice. Therefore, there was no plain error. Defendant's argument that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law, and that the lower court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal, was rejected. The victim suffered a protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily organ, his left eye, and sustained a &quot;serious bodily injury.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The trial court, after the parties stipulated to the evidence, also found appellant guilty of unlawful possession of a controlled substance for a second incident five days later. The trial court placed appellant on one year probation for each offense, to run concurrently, and appellant challenged the decision. On appeal, appellant contended that the trial court improperly denied his motions to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of an unconstitutional seizure and search. The appellate court found that, as to the first incident, this was properly viewed as an interrupted transaction; i.e., both parties had begun the transaction in that they were holding the objects necessary to complete the transaction, and were it not for the arrival of the officers, the transaction would have been momentarily consummated. As to the second, however, the appellate court found that the stop was based on an anonymous tip which was insufficient to meet the probable cause standard required.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One victim owed defendant money and crack cocaine. Defendant was not satisfied with his collection effort so he ordered victim, his brother, and another person in the house to lie on top of one another on a bed. Defendant shot them with a machine gun. The shooting was witnessed by a first woman who was with defendant. The first woman was identified by a dying victim, told police of defendant's involvement, and entered into a plea agreement. Defendant told a second woman acquaintance that he had blown his clip. The second woman told a witness that she and her friend killed somebody, but the second woman did not live to testify. The jury found she had been shot and burned by the defendant. The murder weapons were found at the home of another woman where defendant slept. The court of appeals determined, inter alia, that (1) limited cross-examination of the first woman, prosecution closing arguments, and jurisdiction over and joinder of the obstruction of justice charge were proper, and (2) the second woman's out-of-court statements were admissible under Devonshire since she was a potential witness killed by defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During jury selection in a murder trial in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, the prosecutor exercised one of his peremptory strikes against a juror out of expressed concern that the juror might be a follower of &quot;Louis Farrakhan.&quot; Defendants contended the prosecutor unconstitutionally used a peremptory strike to exclude a juror solely on the grounds of suspected religious affiliation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principal issue on appeal was whether this exclusion was constitutionally discriminatory on the basis of religion in violation of the Batson doctrine. Taking into account all the facts and circumstances, the court concluded that defendants failed to raise a constitutional challenge to the prosecutor's religious-affiliation-based strike with sufficient precision to fairly apprise the trial court of the constitutional question. Since defendants did not raise the allegations with the required specificity, the instant court reviewed only for plain error, and determined that it could not depart from the &quot;great deference&quot; granted to the trial court and to its effective determination that the strike, based upon an inferred allegiance to &quot;Louis Farrakhan,&quot; related to a genuine race-neutral concern regarding the potential juror's desire to hinder any possible conviction. The court rejected defendants' numerous assertions of reversible trial error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were reimprisoned for violating their parole during the period between 1987 and 1997 when the District of Columbia Court of Appeals' decision in Noble prohibited credit of accrued street time. Their petitions for writs of habeas corpus were denied and the court of appeals vacated the decision and granted rehearing en banc to reconsider the propriety of retroactive application of the Noble decision. The proscription against ex post facto laws was not violated because D.C. Code &sect; 24-206(a) went into effect before defendants committed their offenses. The due process clause was not implicated because the decision in Noble was not unforeseeable. Defendants were on actual notice that they might lose street time upon revocation of parole in the event their prison sentences were designated to federal rather than district facilities.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff lost control of his restaurant premises to an alleged confidence man.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trial judge in the Domestic Violence Unit (Unit) of the District of Columbia Superior Court found appellant guilty of simple assault. Appellant moved to have his conviction vacated on the grounds that the Unit was constituted in violation of law, and that the prosecution of domestic violence crimes constituted unconstitutional discrimination against men. The motion was denied, and appellant challenged the denial and conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A car driven by appellant's girlfriend collided with a police car as a result of an altercation between appellant and his girlfriend. The officer pulled the car over and witnessed appellant striking and choking his girlfriend after they had exited the car. Appellant was arrested and charged with simple assault. The appellate court held that the case was properly assigned to the Domestic Violence Unit because the Chief Judge of the Superior Court had the legal authority to create the Unit under the District of Columbia Court Reorganization Act of 1970, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 11-101 et seq. (1995). Appellant was not deprived of his due process due to the fact that the criminal trial judge might also preside over a family court issue because there was a presumption that a trial judge, in deciding a case, would disregard any inadmissible evidence. Appellant failed to prove that there was a discriminatory decision to prosecute that denied him of equal protection under the law on the basis of his gender because he failed to present substantial evidence of a failure to arrest or prosecute women who were similarly situated when it came to the commission of domestic violence cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction and denial of the motion for post-conviction relief was affirmed. The creation of a Domestic Violence Unit within the local court system was authorized by statute. The prosecution of appellant did not violate equal protection because he failed to prove that there was a failure to arrest or prosecute similarly situated women.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant doctors were charged with obstruction of justice for talking to a witness, the alleged victim and a patient of both doctors, to convince her not to testify against one doctor at his sex abuse trial, offering her money. Though acquitted of sex abuse, that doctor was convicted of criminal contempt for approaching the victim at the other doctor's office and asking to pray with her, violating his pretrial release conditions. Both were convicted of obstruction of justice. The appellate court affirmed the criminal contempt but reversed the obstruction of justice convictions. The trial judge unduly restricted defense expert testimony relevant to the victim's credibility. The prosecutor made improper arguments in closing and rebuttal, and misstated the record and applicable law. The obstruction of justice statute,&nbsp;D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-722(a)(2), required intent to inhibit truthful testimony. Thus the case turned decisively on the victim's credibility. The cumulative effect of the restriction of expert testimony and the prosecutor's appeals to the passions of the jury, assaults on opposing counsel, and inflammatory rhetoric, was sufficiently prejudicial to require reversal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Obstruction of justice convictions were reversed, as cumulative error in prosecution's improper arguments and trial court's restriction of defense expert witness testimony as to victim's credibility undermined the trial's fundamental fairness.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff foundation, headquartered in Washington, D.C., purchased struggling scholarly journals from universities and continued them. They were an exempt charity for purposes of federal income taxation, so when defendant local taxing agency assessed real property tax against them, they asserted exemption under two provisions, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 47-1002(8) (1997), for charities, and (17) (1997), for headquarters of organizations whose members would have been exempt. Construing the exemptions strictly against plaintiff, the court held that it could not claim either one. There were no direct controlling relationships between plaintiff and the exempt institutions from which it purchased its publications, and the exemption for charities applied only to charities the primary impact of which was felt in the District of Columbia. The latter provision did not violate the commerce clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, because the United States Congress was not limited by that clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the ruling of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, Tax Division, which disallowed appellants' net operating loss deductions on their tax returns under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 47-1803.3(a)(14) (1997).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant limited partnership, a real estate investor, and appellant bank sought to deduct their losses in prior years against current income in their District of Columbia tax returns. The District disallowed the net operating loss (NOL) deductions sought by appellants because the deductions did not appear on appellants' corresponding federal returns. In consolidated appeals, the court reversed, holding that the refusal to allow the NOL deductions was incompatible with a straightforward reading of D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 47-1803.3(a)(14) in light of the overall structure of District tax law. The statute provided the NOL deduction consistently across the board to all organizations taxed at the entity level, in accord with the District's decision to treat not only individual corporations but also unincorporated businesses as separate tax entities. The District's proposed treatment of NOL deductions as a single exception to that approach was a reading too strained to be acceptable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court decision reversed. The relevant statute clearly indicated that net operating losses could be deducted on the District return in the same manner as allowed under the Internal Revenue Code and as reported on any federal tax return for the same taxable period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District of Columbia filed neglect petitions alleging that appellant had a history of domestic violence and was the prime suspect in the disappearance, and suspected murder, of the mother of his minor children. Those children, the appellees, were removed from appellant's care and placed with relatives pending the outcome of the neglect proceeding. Appellant contested the government's allegations and sought his children's return. The principal question on appeal was whether the trial court abused its discretion in prohibiting appellant from conferring with his criminal defense counsel about his privilege against self-incrimination, and in barring that counsel from the courtroom while appellant asserted that privilege. The trial court erred. Its rulings, which were not justified by any substantial threat to the integrity or confidentiality of the proceeding, arbitrarily infringed appellant's common law and U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's certificate of occupancy was obtained without disclosing that it operated a solid waste disposal site.

Plaintiff sought to enjoin administrative proceedings while entitlement to a certificate and a permit was being resolved.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sued defendant District of Columbia and certain of its agencies, reacting to defendant's efforts to require businesses including plaintiff company to obtain permits for solid waste activities and pay charges and fees, including a solid waste facility charge and collection fee. Plaintiffs sought to enjoin enforcement of the Illegal Dumping Enforcement Act, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 6-2911 et seq., and Solid Waste Facility Permit Act, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 6-3401 et seq., and implementing regulations, alleging they were unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause. The trial court granted plaintiffs a temporary restraining order. It determined the solid waste facility charge was unconstitutional in certain cases but there were factual questions not ripe for decision. Both parties appealed. The court affirmed in part, after finding it had jurisdiction over the interlocutory appeals, and held solid waste facility charge was a tax rather than a fee, but remanded for further factual development and determination of its constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Court found it had jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals and affirmed in part but remanded solid waste facility charge, which it deemed tax rather than fee. Modifying and extending temporary restraining order was not abuse of discretion. Defendant was not precluded from enforcing its zoning laws. Further factual development was essential to determining constitutionality of fee and surcharge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of drug possession, distribution, and drug paraphernalia possession and sought review of his convictions. The court affirmed. Search of appellant's car was proper after officers saw him drop nine ziplock bags with white rocks in them. Officers also observed appellant put a paper bag in the trunk. While prosecutor's comments were improper, they did not constitute reversible error. Defense counsel repeatedly insisted officers were lying about the drug bust. Prosecutor retaliated in closing, inviting the jury to look at defense counsel and then look at himself, which was an obvious reference to their racial differences. Prosecutor stated his whole family lived in the neighborhood where the incident took place. Prosecutor charged defense counsel with racism. Despite the comments, the decision not to grant mistrial was correct. Comments were not directed to central issue of guilt. Evidence of drug activity was unrefuted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated assault while armed after he broke a beer bottle on a bouncer's face in a bar fight. During the appeal, the court adopted the definition of &quot;serious bodily injury&quot; set forth in the sexual abuse statute,&nbsp;D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-4101(7), for the purposes of the aggravated assault statute, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-504.1. Appellant then challenged for the first time in his reply brief the sufficiency of appellee's proof of serious bodily injury. The court considered the newly raised issue and ruled that the trial court should have instructed the jury according to the new definition of &quot;serious bodily injury&quot; and its failure to do so was reversible error. Despite the error, there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict so the lesser-included offense of assault with a dangerous weapon was allowed to stand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of one count of carnal knowledge of a child under 16 and one count of rape, and taking indecent liberties with a minor. His teenage cousin claimed he molested and raped her repeatedly over a two-year period. He was arrested when she became pregnant. His first trial ended in mistrial based on juror misconduct. His second trial ended in conviction. As the indecent liberties conviction was not a lesser included offense of sodomy, that conviction was vacated. On appeal of the other charges, defendant contended his indictment was unconstitutionally vague and the prosecution's evidence constructively amended the allegedly defective indictment. The appellate court affirmed, finding the indictment passed constitutional muster despite its shortcomings, he was not denied fair notice of the charged crimes despite the deficiencies in pleading, and although the rape evidence at trial could not readily be reconciled with the government's bill of particulars he had not been prejudiced.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for taking indecent liberties with a minor was vacated, as it was not a lesser included offense of sodomy, but his convictions for carnal knowledge and rape were affirmed. The deficiencies in indictment and pleadings did not warrant reversal. Defendant was not prejudiced thereby. He had adequate notice of the charges against him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was living in an apartment with a friend, which originally was leased by his friend's father. The friend's father vacated the apartment and asked appellant to vacate the apartment too. Appellant refused. Upon request by the friend's father, the police ejected appellant. The court found that a material issue of fact existed as to whether appellant was a sublessee or whether he was a mere occupant of the apartment precluding summary judgment on the wrongful eviction claim. Summary judgment on the negligent training claim after appellant failed to designate an expert was proper because the training of police officers in eviction issues was not within the common knowledge of lay persons. Summary judgment was proper on the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim because the evidence was insufficient to support the inference of a de facto policy by appellee.</SPAN></P>

Both motions were denied and the trial court found appellant guilty of both possession of a prohibited weapon and possession of an unregistered firearm. Appellant timely appealed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At a traffic stop for a minor parking violation, police recovered a pistol, ammunition clip and marijuana. Appellant's motion to suppress was denied; he was convicted and appealed, arguing trial court error in not suppressing evidence. The court affirmed. Appellant's admission that he had marijuana in his car established probable cause to search the vehicle, to arrest him for possessing marijuana found in the search, and then to search him incident to his arrest. Neither appellant's roadside admission nor physical evidence seized violated his constitutional rights. Appellant's statements at the police station either before receiving his Miranda warnings or after receiving them and invoking his right to refuse to answer questions, were spontaneously volunteered. Nothing in the record suggested that the officer's nods and remarks were other than neutral and passive; they could not have been characterized as coercive or inquisitorial, thus, they were not the product of police interrogation.</SPAN></P>

Third-party plaintiff was located in the District of Columbia. Subsequently, plaintiff was brought to a third-party defendant's Virginia hospital where his skull fracture was diagnosed. Third-party defendants moved to dismiss the claims asserted against them based on D.C. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction; Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted; as well as on the ground that Virginia was a more convenient forum. The court considered the motions and found that it had personal jurisdiction over third-party defendants, pursuant to D.C. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(B) since they were served within 100 miles of the courthouse. The court also held that third-party plaintiff had properly stated a claim for contribution upon which relief may be granted.

Code &sect; 7-2506.01. Defendant moved to dismiss the information on grounds that &sect; 7-2506.01 violated the Second Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. II, as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The government alleged that defendant was in constructive possession of ammunition seized by the police from his home during the execution of a search warrant. The issue was whether &sect; 7-2506.01's near blanket ban on the possession of ammunition imposed could be enforced under the Second Amendment against defendant, a convicted felon. The court held that it could. To the extent it criminalized the possession of ammunition by certain classes of individuals, including convicted felons and persons who possessed ammunition for weapons that were not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes, &sect; 7-2506.01 was not unconstitutional in all of its possible applications, and a facial overbreadth challenge brought under the Second Amendment failed. Further, &sect; 7-2506.01 was constitutional as applied to defendant, a convicted felon. The information was not insufficient for failing to allege that defendant was a convicted felon or that the ammunition he allegedly possessed was intended for use only in machine guns. The government's prosecution of defendant after the Heller decision was not an unconstitutional exercise of legislative authority by the executive branch.</SPAN></P>

While defendant was unquestionably a member of a &quot;distinctive&quot; group for purposes of a fair-cross-section analysis, the court failed to find that black jurors were underrepresented in the superior court venire, finding they were, in fact, overrepresented in the summons issued. Affording defendant the benefit of the doubt as to population figures, the court found that 56.2 % of the jurors in the pool should have been black. The court found defendant's method of determining the breakdown of serving jurors flawed and, using the appropriate analysis, determined that 51 % of those serving during the relevant period were black. The court held that the disparity of, at most, 5.2% was insufficient to support a fair cross section claim. In addition, the court found no systematic exclusion of black jurors. Among other things, the court found that defendant never articulated the racial composition of excluded groups, such as newly naturalized citizens.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor entered into a home improvement contract with the owner, and accepted an advancement by check. The court initially ruled that, because the contractor did not have a license in effect at all times relevant, the contract was illegal and unenforceable. The contractor later contended that, although he did not have a license when he commenced work, he did subsequently obtain a license, one that specifically stated on its face that it was retroactive to a time before he began the work. Thus, he claimed, he was duly licensed to do the work at all times legally relevant, including the time of the contract and the initial payment. The court found that the contractor's motion was to be denied and the contractor held to his settlement agreement. The phrase &quot;unless that person is licensed as a home improvement contractor&quot; in the governing home improvement regulation, D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 14, &sect; 800.1, meant that the license must already have been issued and delivered before the contractor could legally have undertaken the work or received any advance payment; otherwise the home improvement contract was void ab initio and unenforceable under either legal or equitable principles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed its original ruling in the case, the contractor's motion to reconsider was denied, and the original settlement agreement between these parties remained in binding effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city council and defendant mayor filed cross-motions for summary judgment, agreeing there were no questions of fact in the council's action for declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the mayor to implement the Inspector General Qualifications Amendment Act (IGQA), D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 2-302.08(a)(1)(D-i), which would require the incumbent inspector general (IG) for the District of Columbia to vacate his position.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The council passed the IGQA, which amended D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 2-302.08 (2001) by changing the job qualifications for the position of IG in a way that the incumbent IG could not meet. The mayor vetoed the measure and resisted a vote overcoming his veto by telling the IG to remain in the job. The council filed suit for enforcement of the IGQA, and the mayor responded that the amendments violated separation of powers. Since the parties agreed that there were no factual issues, the court decided the suit on summary judgment. The court held that the incumbent IG was an executive appointee and was subject to removal only for cause by the mayor under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 2-302.08(a)(1)(A). The council was allowed, as a legislative body, to examine the IG's performance and to consider that performance in deciding to change the qualifications for the officeholder. However, the council could only apply those new qualifications to future IGs, not to the incumbent. The court severed the portion of the IGQA that would be codified at D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 2-302.08(a)(1)(D-i), which made the new qualifications applicable to the incumbent IG, from the remainder of the IGQA, and it declared that portion void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the mayor's motion for summary judgment and denied the council's motion. The court struck that portion of the IGQA that would require the IG to vacate the position.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an individual and a taxi company, filed an action against defendant District of Columbia seeking a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief barring the continued operation of the District's automated traffic enforcement system (ATES), a refund of fines collected, and damages for violation of their civil rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Plaintiffs sought class certification. The District moved to, inter alia, dismiss the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs contended that the ATES violated the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause because the rebuttable presumption created by D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 50-2209.02 created liability against plaintiffs and forced automobile owners to bear the burden of guilt and fines unless they proved with sworn evidence the identity of the person who actually violated the law. Plaintiffs had been sent numerous civil fines based on pictures taken by the ATES showing their cars speeding and/or running red lights. The court held that the ATES program was within the flexible concept of due process; plaintiffs' due process rights were not violated based on failure of notice or deprivation of the opportunity to be heard. The private interest involved was small in that the violation only carried civil penalties, the complaint contained no concerns that could not be addressed through the quasi-judicial administrative hearing process and subsequent judicial review, and the District's interest in deterring the life-threatening activity of red light running and speeding was significant. In addition, the District was acting within its power when it created the rebuttable presumption in &sect; 50-2209.02.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District's motion to dismiss was granted. Plaintiffs' motion for class certification was denied. The District's other motions were denied as moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the owner of a Maltese puppy, sued defendant, the owner of a Labrador Retriever, to recover veterinarian bills incurred after defendant's dog snapped at the puppy, puncturing his left eye, which eventually went blind. Defendant moved for judgment as a matter of law, pursuant to D.C. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 50.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that plaintiff failed to prove a vital aspect of her case-in-chief. No eyewitness was produced who saw the dogs just prior to or during the incident itself. Defendant produced the only actual eyewitness to the incident between the dogs. The witness, who was also defendant's housemate, testified that plaintiff was 7-10 feet away from defendant but that, apparently without noticing it on his &quot;extended lead,&quot; plaintiff had allowed the puppy to run underneath defendant's dog, who was in a &quot;sit&quot; position, thus startling the bigger dog. She also testified that in the four years that she had known defendant's dog, she had never known the dog to attack a person or another dog. Thus, not only was there no evidence presented by plaintiff as to any prior bad conduct by defendant's dog that would have placed defendant on notice that he was a &quot;dangerous dog,&quot; as defined in D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 8-1901(1)(A)(i)-(ii), but there was affirmative evidence of his prior history of docility. The law precluded the court from awarding any relief to plaintiff because she failed to prove the required &quot;scienter&quot; as to defendant's dog.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion for judgment as a matter of law was granted. Judgment was entered in favor of defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff law firm sued defendants, an advertising company, its executives, and its clients, alleging violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 227. The law firm filed a motion for summary judgment. Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment challenging the constitutionality of the Act on First Amendment grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The law firm received 1,634 unsolicited fax advertisements send by the advertising company during one week. During that week, the law firm repeatedly requested that the company cease sending such faxes. The faxes continued to come. Contrary to defendants' contention, the court held that the Act did not violate the United States Constitution. The advertisements sent by the company mentioned neither the sender nor the advertisement sponsors as required by 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 227(d)(1). In addition, the sending of the unsolicited faxes shifted some of the costs of advertising to the law firm and occupied the law firm's fax machine so that it was unavailable for legitimate business. The court further concluded that the Act was not unconstitutional under the void-for-vagueness doctrine. Next, the court determined that the executives were liable because they were clearly involved in the business practices that led to the sending of the unwanted faxes. Finally, the court awarded the law firm treble damages after determining that the company willfully and knowingly violated the Act and finding it necessary to deter such behavior.</SPAN></P>
