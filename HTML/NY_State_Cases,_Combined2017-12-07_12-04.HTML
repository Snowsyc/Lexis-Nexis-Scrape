</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs, members of group self-insured trusts, sued defendants, which included the New York State Workers' Compensation Board, challenging defendants' assessments against them under Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 50(5). The Supreme Court Albany County, New York, granted plaintiffs summary judgment as to their claim that the assessments were an unconstitutional taking and ordered the Board to repay the assessments. Both sides appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs argued that &sect; 50(5) did not authorize the Board to levy administrative expense assessments against them for the unpaid compensation and benefits owed by defaulted group self-insurers. The appellate court held that it was clear that group self-insurers were intended to be included among those to be assessed to provide the funds to cover the defaults of all private self-insurers, including groups, under &sect; 50(5). Section 50(5) did not violate U.S. Const. amend. V's Takings Clause because 1) while the amounts of the assessments might have been unanticipated, their economic effect on plaintiffs did not rise to the level of a taking; 2) levying assessments against group self-insurers was consistent with the other provisions of the Workers' Compensation Law; 3) and plaintiffs knew or should have known of their potential liability for the assessments. Section 50(5) did not violate due process because it was sufficiently clear and, having been enacted before plaintiffs existed, was not retroactively applied to them. As &sect; 50(5) could not violate contracts that did not exist when it was enacted, it did not violate the Contracts Clause of U.S. Const. art I, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Workers' Compensation -- Coverage -- Assessments against Group Self-Insured Trusts</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The Workers' Compensation Board was authorized to levy assessments against plaintiffs, members of group self-insured trusts, for the unpaid compensation and benefits owed by defaulted group self-insured trusts pursuant to Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 50 (5) (former [f]) and (g), as a fair reading of the statute, within the context of the related provisions and legislative history, revealed that group self-insurers were intended to be included among those to be assessed to provide the funds to cover the defaults of all private self-insurers, including groups. Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 50 (3-a) subjects group self-insurers to the same statutory provisions governing individual self-insured employers, and former paragraph (f), which is among the provisions relating to self-insurance deemed applicable to group self-insurance, was intended to apply to all self-insurers as evidenced by its legislative history inasmuch as its purpose was to establish a method for paying claims of an insolvent self-insurer out of administrative assessments to be levied against all private self-insurers. Moreover, the legislative history of the 2008 amendments to the Workers' Compensation Law, which relabeled former paragraph (f) as paragraph (g) and expressly included group self-insurers within the meaning of the term &quot;self-insured employers,&quot; made clear that the Board was always authorized to impose assessments with respect to both individual and group self-insurers. Plaintiffs had always been subject to assessments by the Board to cover defaulted individual self-insured employers, and while the Board did not include assessments to cover its payment of the compensation liabilities of insolvent self-insured groups until 2007, self-insured groups had not defaulted prior thereto. Furthermore, allowing assessments against all self-insurers was not inconsistent with the contractual obligation of joint and several liability assumed by the individual members of a group self-insurer.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Taking of Property -- Workers' Compensation -- Assessments against Group Self-Insured Trusts </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The Workers' Compensation Board's application of Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 50 (5) (former [f]) and (g) to plaintiffs, members of group self-insured trusts, levying assessments for the unpaid compensation and benefits owed by defaulted group self-insured trusts did not violate the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. While the amounts of the assessments may have been unanticipated and plaintiffs may have been deprived of substantial amounts of money to pay them, their economic effect on plaintiffs did not rise to the level of a taking as their liability directly depended on their proportional role in the self-insurance program and the workers' compensation system. Under the statute, the costs associated with defaulting self-insurers are to be assessed against all self-insurers, and plaintiffs were self-insurers. Moreover, the levying of assessments against self-insurers was not inconsistent with other provisions of the Workers' Compensation Law, which employs such a mechanism against employers and insurance carriers to recoup the system's expenses. The application of former paragraph (f) and paragraph (g) also did not interfere with plaintiffs' reasonable investment-backed expectations as the enforcement of the statute was consistent with the legislative scheme which was sufficiently clear from the language of the statute, and thus plaintiffs knew or should have known of their liability for administrative expense assessments. As voluntary participants who elected to exercise the privilege of self-insurance, plaintiffs could not complain that the assessments imposed to administer the self-insurance program consistently with the purpose and goals of the workers' compensation system was an unexpected taking of their property. Furthermore, the character of the government action at issue was a public program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good, and, as such, was not generally the type of regulation considered to rise to the level of a taking.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Due Process of Law -- Workers' Compensation -- Assessments against Group Self-Insured Trusts </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. The Workers' Compensation Board's application of Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 50 (5) (former [f]) and (g) to plaintiffs, members of group self-insured trusts, levying assessments for the unpaid compensation and benefits owed by defaulted group self-insured trusts was not unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Former paragraph (f) was sufficiently clear, to a reasonable degree of certainty, so that plaintiffs were not forced to guess at its meaning. Moreover, inasmuch as the statute authorized the assessments at issue since its enactment in 1976, prior to plaintiffs' existence, they had notice of it and it was not retroactively applied to them. The statute also did not violate the Contracts Clause as a statute cannot be said to impair a contract that did not exist at the time of its enactment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Due Process of Law -- Workers' Compensation -- Continuing Assessments on Inactive Group Self-Insured Trusts </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. The due process challenge by plaintiffs, members of group self-insured trusts, to the 2008 amendments to Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 15 (8) (h) (4) and &sect; 151 (2) (b), which adjusted the formula used to determine continuing assessments, decreasing over time, on inactive self-insurers for the administrative expenses of the Special Disability Fund and the Workers' Compensation Board, was without merit. Legislation readjusting rights and burdens is not unlawful solely because it upsets otherwise settled expectations. Here, the 2008 amendments--which changed the method for determining the amounts owed by inactive group self-insurers from a calculation based on annual payroll for the preceding year, resulting from 2007 amendments, to a calculation based on payroll at the time the individual or group self-insurer ceases to self-insure, reduced by a factor reflecting the reduction in compensation liabilities since becoming inactive--did not impose an unfair exit penalty. Nor did the 2008 amendments improperly alter plaintiffs' liability without notice or justification as there is no requirement to provide notice of enactment of a statute beyond the normal process of enactment, publication and an opportunity for those within the statute's reach to become familiar with its requirements and to comply with them. Moreover, the legislative history of the 2008 amendments revealed that, to the extent the 2007 amendments allowed inactive groups to completely avoid liability for the assessments after one year of inactivity despite their continuing, although decreasing, liability for compensation and participation in the program, the limitation was error, it was promptly corrected and was not a settled expectation. Additionally, plaintiffs were not subjected to double assessments by the 2008 amendments since an inactive group's assessment were expressly reduced over time based on the group's diminishing compensation liabilities, and the assessments were therefore proportional to plaintiffs' compensation liabilities. Furthermore, the 2008 amendments did not effect a taking inasmuch as prior to 2007, inactive groups were responsible for paying continued assessments based on claims that accrued while they were self-insured, and the continuation of that responsibility, albeit by a different calculation, did not interfere with any reasonable investment-backed expectation, nor did they have a disproportionate effect on plaintiffs as assessments are applied to all self-insurers and insurance carriers in the workers' compensation system. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant producers and providers brought a combined proceeding pursuant to CPLR art. 78 and action for declaratory judgment, to, among other things, declare ECL 19-0323 to be unconstitutional and annul certain regulations promulgated by respondent Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). The Supreme Court, Saratoga County (New York), dismissed the application. The producers and the providers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The producers and the providers challenged 6 NYCRR 248-1.1(10), (20), (28) and argued that the DEC's interpretation of the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA), ECL 19-0323, language imposing diesel emission controls on vehicles operated &quot;on behalf of&quot; the State exceeded its authority. The appellate court found that prior legal usage did not support the DEC's broad construction. The phrase &quot;on behalf of&quot; was legislatively used to connote a direct representative or agency relationship. The DEC's interpretation of the term &quot;on behalf of&quot; to mean a class including but not limited to prime contractors, subcontractors, and sub-subcontractors extended well beyond the phrase's commonly accepted legal meaning. Nothing in the language of the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act, ECL 19-0323, construed as a whole, indicated that the legislature intended it to extend beyond prime contractors. The legislature did not intend to impose the requirements of the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act, ECL 19-0323, on vehicles other than those used by prime contractors under direct contract with state agencies and public authorities, as defined in 6 NYCRR 248-1.1(23).</SPAN></P>

The board claimed that, based on this earlier proceeding, the three-year repose period of RPTL 727(1) barred the owner's grievance. The owner argued that the tenant was not &quot;aggrieved&quot; within the meaning of RPTL 704(1) and thus lacked standing to commence the prior proceeding. The appellate court found that the record supported the trial court's determination that the owner received actual notice that the tenant was conducting the tax certiorari proceeding while time remained to object to the tenant's standing. The owner's acquiescence and assistance supported the finding that the owner was in privity with the tenant for collateral estoppel purposes. Considering the owner's knowledge of the prior proceeding, its longstanding contractual relationship with the tenant, and the alignment of their interests in reducing their property tax liability, the statutory purposes of RPTL 727(1) were best served by deeming the owner to be in privity with the tenant in the prior proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff adult establishments brought actions against defendant city, challenging the 2001 Amendments to the Zoning Resolution of the City of New York, N.Y (2001 Amendments). Following an earlier appeal, the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), among other things, found that the 2001 Amendments were constitutional with regard to bookstores, video stores, and topless night clubs and bars. The adult establishments appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In its decision, the Court of Appeal of New York established a study of the Department of City Planning, as well as other studies and court decisions, as the basis for assessing the claim that &quot;60/40&quot; businesses no longer continued to resemble the kinds of adult uses that were shown to cause negative secondary effects. The appellate court held that the trial court did not elaborate on the criteria by which it determined that the adult establishments' essential nature was similar or dissimilar to the sexually explicit adult uses that were analyzed in those studies and case law. Moreover, it failed to state the facts on which it based its judgment. The trial court's judgment was insufficient to answer the question posed on remittitur. The decision was &quot;manifestly inadequate&quot; and violated CPLR 4213(b). The trial court also erred in finding that the adult establishments' argument that reconstituted 60/40 clubs no longer resembled their pre-1995 forbears was entirely irrelevant. This deprived the adult establishments of their opportunity to be heard. There was no merit to the city's contention that adult establishments' &quot;as-applied&quot; issue was neither raised nor preserved.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trial -- Decision -- Failure to State Facts Supporting Decision </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In related actions challenging a municipal zoning ordinance regulating adult establishments, the Supreme Court's decision violated CPLR 4213 (b) because it did not elaborate on the criteria by which it determined that the essential nature of plaintiffs' business was similar or dissimilar to the sexually explicit adult uses that were analyzed in studies and case law and found to have negative secondary effects on the community. It failed to state the particular facts on which it based its judgment; rather, it simply detailed the municipality's evidence and arrived at legal conclusions. That was insufficient to answer the question posed on remittitur from the Court of Appeals--namely, whether certain establishments were similar in nature to adult establishments that had been shown by means of empirical data to cause negative secondary effects. As Supreme Court did not provide any direction for the parties or appellate courts to adequately review, analyze, or understand the ruling, its decision was manifestly inadequate and violated the dictates of CPLR 4213 (b). Given the scale of the trial record below, which ran into the hundreds of pages, it was impossible to properly review on appeal Supreme Court's conclusions of law without the benefit of established findings of fact.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Zoning Amendments Restricting Adult Establishments </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In assessing the validity of amendments to a municipal law regulating adult establishments, the trial court, on remand, must compare &quot;self- identified&quot; 60/40 businesses--those which devoted 40% of their area to adult activities--with adult establishments found in a municipal study to create negative secondary effects on the community, so as to determine whether the 60/40 businesses retained a predominant focus on sexually explicit materials. The amendments sought to include as adult establishments, businesses that apparently complied with the 60/40 rule but, because of other factors, retained their character as adult establishments. Supreme Court must determine the particular characteristics associated with the promotion of sexually explicit materials. The negative characteristics identified by the Supreme Court would serve as baseline for adjudicating whether the 60/40 businesses had so transformed their character as to no longer resemble adult businesses that create negative secondary effects. Using that baseline, Supreme Court would then need to determine whether the 60/40 businesses had a similar predominant focus on sexually explicit materials. In using the municipal study to assess the constitutionality of the amendments in question, the court should consider if the 60/40 businesses have a predominant focus on sexually explicit materials.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Zoning Amendments Restricting Adult Establishments </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In an action challenging the validity of amendments to a municipal law regulating adult establishments, in which the municipality proffered evidence in support of its claim that 60/40 businesses, i.e., those which devote 40% of their area to adult activities, displayed a predominant, ongoing focus on sexually explicit materials or activities, the trial court, on remand, must assess whether that evidence, and any additional evidence that the municipality wishes to adduce, entitle it to a judgment in its favor on a theory that 60/40 businesses retain the character of adult businesses which create negative secondary effects on the community. The municipality's evidence is subject to &quot;intermediate scrutiny.&quot; Very little evidence is required to uphold the constitutionality of the amendments, which sought to include as adult establishments businesses that apparently complied with the 60/40 rule but, because of other factors, retained their character as adult establishments. The municipality's evidence must be relevant to the issue of whether the 60/40 businesses have so transformed their character that they no longer resemble adult businesses that created negative secondary effects: it must establish that the materials that formed the basis of its justification for the amendments were indeed of an adult character. Moreover, the municipality's evidence must also present a fair snapshot of the businesses that are the object of its claim.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Zoning Amendments Restricting Adult Establishments </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In an action challenging the validity of amendments to a municipal law regulating adult establishments, in which the municipality proffered evidence in support of its claim that 60/40 businesses, i.e., those which devote 40% of their area to adult activities, displayed a predominant, ongoing focus on sexually explicit materials or activities, the trial court erred in finding irrelevant and according no weight to plaintiffs' evidence that those reconstituted 60/40 clubs no longer resemble 100% adult businesses which were found to create negative secondary effects on the community. In so doing, it deprived plaintiffs of their opportunity to be heard by depriving them of their ability to cast doubt on the municipality's rationale for its ordinance, which sought to include as adult establishments those that apparently complied with the 60/40 rule but because of other factors retained their character as adult businesses. On remittitur, Supreme Court must therefore address any relevant evidence proffered by the plaintiffs to show that there has been a significant change in the character of 60/40 businesses. However, the court is not to consider evidence that is irrelevant to the question of whether those establishments continue to have a predominant focus on sexually explicit materials.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Zoning Amendments Restricting Adult Establishments -- Evidentiary Standard </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In assessing the validity of amendments to a municipal law regulating adult establishments, the trial court, on remand, should assess the municipality's evidence in light of a somewhat heightened standard of proof: notwithstanding the simplified nature of proof required of municipalities by the United States Supreme Court and the New York Court of Appeals, imposing a level of intermediate scrutiny requires more conviction of the connection between legislative ends and means than does the rational basis standard, but only in the sense of evidence that is reasonably believed to be relevant to the secondary effects generated by adult businesses.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Preservation of Issue for Review -- &quot;As Applied&quot; Constitutional Challenge to Municipal Ordinance Regulating Adult Businesses </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In related actions challenging the constitutionality of a municipal ordinance regulating adult businesses, plaintiffs' &quot;as applied&quot; challenge was preserved for appellate review where plaintiffs specifically raised the issue of such a challenge during a colloquy wherein the court posed the question of what might happen if it decided that some clubs didn't have a dominant sexual purpose in their activities, but others did.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Zoning Amendments Restricting Adult Establishments -- &quot;As Applied&quot; Challenge </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. In judicial challenges to the constitutionality of amendments to a municipal ordinance regulating adult establishments, given the possibility that the amendments could curtail legitimate free speech, an &quot;as applied&quot; challenge would be an appropriate means to challenge them if the facial challenge against the ordinance failed. In upholding the amendments, Supreme Court simply stated that &quot;[m]erely because [plaintiff has] introduced evidence that some topless clubs may not have an ongoing focus on adult activities, does not defeat the pattern established by [the municipality] of topless clubs having an ongoing focus of adult activities.&quot; Thus, the court gave no indication of any facts it took into account in arriving at its decision on the &quot;as applied&quot; challenge, or whether it even considered them. Neither its decision nor judgment made any factual findings to help resolve the question of whether only some of the clubs challenging the amendments were found to have a predominantly sexual focus or whether all of them were. The result of the court's decision was that some of the clubs that had aspects of an adult business, but were not primarily devoted to adult activities, could be put out of business by a law that might not apply to them. Accordingly, the matter was remitted for a decision setting forth findings of fact as to plaintiffs' &quot;as applied&quot; challenge. </SPAN></P>

All parties cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The resident argued that the commissioner's appointment was invalid because he did not reside in the town, nor did he possess the qualifications established for this position by the town in its local law. The appellate court found that, since the local law was silent as to whether the commissioner had to be a town resident, the issue was whether state law served to impose such a requirement. The town, when it enacted the local law, made no reference to any state statute, nor did it identify in the local law any state statute that it intended to supercede. Pursuant to Town Law &sect;&sect; 20(1)(a), 23(1), the commissioner was a town officer who had to be a town resident. Since the commissioner acknowledged that he was not a town resident when he was appointed, and did not intend to become one in the future, his appointment did not comport with relevant state law and was invalid. As to the personnel officer, Town Law &sect; 64(5) was controlling and, thus, as the trial court found, the personnel officer's appointment had to be limited to the remainder of his predecessor's unexpired term.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Officers--Eligibility for Office.--Respondent Town Board's appointment of Commissioner of Public Works was invalid because individual appointed did not reside in Town; since local law was silent as to whether Commissioner of Public Works must be town resident, issue was whether state law served to impose such requirement; under Public Officers Law &sect; 3 (1) and Town Law &sect; 23 (1), if town enacts local law creating public or civil office and person appointed to it is town officer, appointee must be town resident; since neither Public Officers Law nor Town Law defines what constitutes public or civil office or who qualifies as town officer, that determination depends upon nature of position, its role in town governance and whether position involved has responsibilities that require high degree of initiative and independent judgment; here, Commissioner of Public Works took oath of office, served two-year term, and according to Town Code, was principal executive officer and administrative head of Department of Public Works; given nature of position, and crucial role it played providing essential services for Town, Commissioner of Public Works was town officer who was required to be town resident. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The LOP sought, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that a sewer unit connection fee imposed pursuant to Haverstraw, N.Y., Code &sect;&sect; 137-21 and 137-22 was unconstitutional and that the adoption of the fee by the board and the enforcement thereof was invalid. Various affirmative defenses asserted by defendants were stricken. The trial court also denied a motion by town-A and the board for summary judgment dismissal of the complaint. On appeal, the court found that the LP could not have raised the challenge to the constitutionality of &sect;&sect; 137-21 and 137-22 in a CPLR art. 78 proceeding. Such a proceeding was not a proper vehicle to challenge the constitutionality of a legislative enactment. Accordingly, the claims challenging the constitutionality thereof were governed by the six-year limitations period of CPLR 213(1). Further, they were not time-barred based on the accrual date of the claims. However, claims regarding the validity of the adoption and enforcement of the fee were administrative actions that were reviewable in an art. 78 proceeding.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff town appealed a judgment of the Supreme Court, Nassau County (New York), which denied its motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissed the amended complaint, seeking to enjoin defendant, the Division of Human Rights (DHR), from proceeding with an administrative complaint against the town, alleging violations of the Human Rights Law. The town also appealed an order denying its motion for reargument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The town amended the zoning code to create new zoning districts for building below-market rate senior communities and below-market, price-controlled housing for first time homebuyers. The code contained required residency preferences and accompanying restrictive covenants. The DHR filed an administrative complaint against the town and others connected to developments constructed under the housing programs, charging them with unlawful discriminatory practices in housing, in violation of the Human Rights Law, Executive Law &sect; 296(6). The town filed suit, seeking to enjoin the administrative action and related proceedings. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the merits and for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. On appeal, the court found that the town's as-applied constitutional challenge was subject to the exhaustion doctrine in order to establish the necessary factual record. The trial court properly determined on the merits that DHR had authority to file a complaint on its own initiative under Executive Law &sect; 295(6)(b). The facial constitutional challenge, based on DHR's combined investigative and adjudicative functions, failed on the merits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court modified the judgment by adding provisions that declared that DHR acted within its authority by initiating the administrative complaint on its own, and that various provisions were not unconstitutional. As so modified, the judgment was affirmed. The order of the trial court was also affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Law--Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies.--Cause of action seeking declaration that town was not proper respondent and was not subject to provisions of Human Rights Law it was charged with violating in Division of Human Rights (DHR) complaint was properly dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies; claim went to merits of any future finding that town's action violated charged provisions, and did not implicate DHR's broad jurisdiction to determine discriminatory practices in first instance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Law--Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies.--Cause of action seeking declaration that Division of Human Rights complaint was void because it constituted reverse discrimination against residents of town was properly dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies; claim did not facially challenge constitutionality of Human Rights Law or any specific provisions thereof, but challenged possible application of charged provisions to town's housing programs, and required resolution of factual issues at administrative level. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Rights--State Division of Human Rights--Constitutionality of Investigative and Adjudicative Powers.--Cause of action seeking declaration that Division of Human Rights (DHR) complaint was void because Executive Law &sect; 295 (6) (a) and (b), which collectively authorize Division of Human Rights to both file and pass upon complaints, was unconstitutional as deprivation of due process rights under federal and state constitutions, was without merit; combination of investigative and adjudicative functions in single administrative agency or officer is not, ipso facto, denial of due process; here, procedures provide that, should matter proceed to administrative hearing, it will be heard by administrative law judge who has not previously been involved in investigation, engaged in conciliation proceeding or caused notice of hearing to be issued (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Executive Law &sect; 297 [4] [a]; 9 NYCRR 465.12 [d] [1]); moreover, party charged with housing discrimination, as was case here, has option, within 20 days of finding of probable cause, to elect to have court action commenced (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Executive Law &sect; 297 [9]); accordingly, combined functions of DHR do not violate due process. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff health care facility brought sued defendant department of health (DOH), challenging the DOH's method for applying funds recouped for unpaid gross receipts toward assessment delinquencies for Public Health Law &sect; 2807-d taxes. The Supreme Court, Bronx County (New York), inter alia, granted the facility's cross motion for summary judgment declaring that the penalties were unconstitutional only to a certain extent. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The trial court declared that the penalties were unconstitutional to the extent of declaring that the facility was entitled to have 50 percent of the subject interest and penalties waived. The appellate court agreed with the trial court's finding that the facility was not entitled to the benefit of the first amnesty granted by the legislature because it did not pay the outstanding assessments by the March 31, 2001 deadline. However, contrary to the trial court's finding, the record did not show that the facility was owed substantially more than the outstanding assessments by the DOH as of March 31, 2001. Thus, the facility's claim that it was owed monies as of March 31, 2001 referred to retroactive rate increases that it anticipated but that had not yet been calculated by the DOH or approved for payment. The fact that the DOH eventually paid the various sums did not support the facility's argument that those sums were owed as of March 31, 2001. The amount owed to the facility was insufficient to pay the more than $ 2 million in unpaid assessments that the facility owed for the period of April 1997 through December 1999, which was the period at issue here.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment was modified, the DOH's motion for summary judgment was granted, and the declaration sought by the cross motion was vacated. Otherwise, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The statute allowed individuals who had attained the age of 55 and completed at least 25 years of service to retire without suffering the reduction in benefits that would otherwise have resulted by operation of Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 440 et seq. and Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 600 et seq. To be eligible, an employee had to hold a position represented by collective bargaining units affiliated with the New York state united teachers employee organization (NYSUT). The association argued that L 2010, ch. 45 violated equal protection. The governor and the retirement system proffered, as a rational basis for the distinction between NYSUT members and nonmembers, that the eligibility exclusion provided a legitimate means to target individuals who, if encouraged to retire, would have provided the most cost savings-namely, teachers and teachers assistants that made up most of the individuals represented by NYSUT, as opposed to the supervisory and administrative personnel represented by the association.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The parents and students commenced the declaratory judgment action alleging that students were being deprived of the opportunity of a sound basic education, in violation of NY Const. art. XI, &sect; 1, because the school districts where the students attended school were substantially underfunded. The State argued that the claims were not ripe for review because they were based upon data obtained before the enactment of education aid reform legislation. The State argued that since the aid had not yet been fully implemented, the factual record was incomplete and the effects of the legislation could not be measured. As the complaint was replete with detailed data allegedly demonstrating, among other things, inadequate teacher qualifications, building standards and equipment, which illustrate glaring deficiencies in the current quality of the schools and a substantial need for increased aid, the reviewing court held that it was compelled to affirm.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a declaratory judgment action in which parents of minor students alleged that their children were being deprived of a sound basic education in violation of NY Constitution, article XI, &sect;1 because the school districts where the students attended school were substantially underfunded, Supreme Court properly denied defendant State of New York's motion to dismiss. The constitutionality of particular levels of education funding are a proper matter for consideration by the courts, and the fact that the court may be required to determine the rights of the parties upon the happening of a future event does not mean that the declaratory judgment will be merely advisory. Here, in addition to allegations of deficiencies in the quality of schools in plaintiffs' districts and a substantial need for increased aid, plaintiffs also claimed that, even with the increases anticipated by the enactment of education aid reform legislation (Foundation Aid), their districts would still be substantially short of the funding levels needed to provide a constitutionally sound basic education. Thus, plaintiffs' claims were ripe for review despite being related to a future event, the implementation of Foundation Aid and the increases in funding encompassed therein, since such event was controlled by defendant and was likely to occur. Moreover, as a judicial determination of their claims would have an immediate and practical effect on the rights and actions of the parties if plaintiffs were successful in proving their allegations that such funding would not remedy the existing unconstitutional deprivation of the opportunity to obtain a sound basic education, and inasmuch as the hardship that may be suffered if consideration of the claims was not permitted to go forward was not insignificant, remote or contingent, the matter was justiciable.  </SPAN></P>

In a declaratory judgment action in which parents of minor students alleged that their children were being deprived of a sound basic education in violation of NY Constitution, article XI, &sect;1 because the school districts where the students attended school were substantially underfunded, plaintiffs' claims were not rendered moot by the Legislature's enactment of education aid reform legislation (Foundation Aid) as it was possible that plaintiffs would successfully demonstrate, as alleged in their complaint and based on available data, that even the planned increases in aid were not sufficient to enable the school districts to provide a constitutionally-guaranteed sound basic education. Moreover, the constitutionality of particular levels of education funding is a proper matter for consideration by the court and plaintiffs' rights would be directly affected by a determination of their claims. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant licensees brought a hybrid CPLR art. 78 and declaratory judgment proceeding against respondent county, and others, challenging Nassau County, N.Y., Ordinance No. 5-2008, as amended by Nassau County, N.Y., Ordinance 9-2008 (Ordinance), and seeking to enjoin enforcement of the Ordinance. The Supreme Court, Nassau County (New York), denied the petition and dismissed the proceeding. The licensees appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The principal issue on appeal was whether the Ordinance, which banned the possession of &quot;deceptively colored&quot; firearms, was preempted by Penal Law &sect; 400.00. The appellate court found that, contrary to the county's contention, far from affecting mere possession, the Ordinance interfered with the licensing provisions set forth in Penal Law &sect; 265.00 et seq. and Penal Law &sect; 400.00 et seq. by making it illegal for an individual to possess a deceptively colored handgun in Nassau County even though such individual held a valid firearms license under state law. Further, the appellate court rejected the county's argument that &sect; 400.00 referred only to firearm licensing procedures and the qualifications needed for an individual to be granted a license, and did not refer to types of weapons. Indeed, &sect; 400.00(2) specifically precluded from licensing assault weapons and disguised guns. Conflict preemption did not apply. However, in light of the comprehensive and detailed regulatory language and scheme of &sect; 400.00, which demonstrated the legislature's intent to preempt the field of firearm regulation, &sect; 400.00 preempted the Ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment was modified by granting the petition insofar as asserted by one of the licensees and declaring that Nassau County, N.Y., Ordinance No. 5-2008, as amended by Nassau County, N.Y., Ordinance 9-2008 was preempted by Penal Law &sect; 400.00; as so modified, the judgment was affirmed insofar as appealed from.</SPAN></P>

Although, under current state law, possession of &quot;deceptively colored&quot; firearms is implicitly allowed, there was no conflict preemption between the county ordinance and state law since there was no &quot;head-on collision&quot; between the two.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Local Laws -- Preemption by State -- Gun Control -- Policy Field Preemption </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Local Laws -- Preemption by State -- Gun Control -- Implicit Field Preemption </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A county ordinance (County of Nassau, Miscellaneous Laws, tit 69 [Local Law No. 5-2008, as amended by Local Law No. 9-2008]) which prohibited the possession of &quot;deceptively colored&quot; firearms was preempted by Penal Law &sect; 400.00, which contains detailed and comprehensive provisions for issuing firearms licenses in the state. The state statute evinced an intent to set forth a uniform system of licensing and provided that it was the &quot;exclusive statutory mechanism&quot; for such licensing. As such, no locality may supplant that licensing requirement, since doing so would undermine the uniformity of the system, whereby a license issued in any county is valid in any other county (save New York City). The county ordinance interrupted that uniformity by imposing additional requirements for lawful firearms possession, and if each county enacted additional restrictions, the uniformity of the scheme would be destroyed. The state statute, by its detailed nature, left no room for local ordinances to operate. Thus, when the Legislature demonstrated its intent to preempt the field, all local ordinances, such as the one in question, were preempted, regardless of whether they actually conflicted with the state law. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner landlord sued respondent New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR), seeking a declaration that Rent Stabilization Code (9 NYCRR) &sect; 2522.3(f)(4), a regulation clarifying N.Y. City, N.Y., Rent Stab. Law 26-513(a), was invalid, or, in the alternative, an order prohibiting its retroactive application. The Supreme Court, New York County, New York, denied the requested relief; the landlord appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">On leaving the Mitchell-Lama program, the landlord's rents were regulated by N.Y. City, N.Y., Rent Stab. Law &sect; 26-512(b)(3). After it filed applications for rent increases, the Division enacted &sect; 2522.3(f)(4), which provided that any change in economic circumstances due to termination of a prior regulation of rent would not justify a rent adjustment without a showing of &quot;hardship&quot; under Rent Stabilization Code (9 NYCRR) &sect; 2522.4(b) or (c). The landlord argued that &sect; 2522.3(f)(4) was invalid because it contravened &sect; 26-513(a), which provided former Mitchell-Lama buildings with an absolute right to a rent increase. The appellate court disagreed. The landlord did not meet its burden to establish that &sect; 2522.3(f)(4) was inconsistent with &sect;&sect; 26-512(b)(3) and 26-513(a), as there was no evidence the legislature meant to permit former Mitchell-Lama owners to charge market rents on exiting the program. DHCR, as a government agency, was not estopped from taking the position it did on appeal. It did not act in bad faith by delaying its decision on the landlord's application so it could enact &sect; 2522.3(f)(4), as the regulation did not change the law to the landlord's detriment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Rent Regulation -- Building Emerging from Mitchell-Lama Program -- Initial Legal Regulated Rent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Rent Stabilization Code (9 NYCRR) &sect; 2522.3 (f) (4), which provides that the previous regulation of an apartment building by virtue of any state or federal program shall not, in and of itself, constitute a &quot;unique and peculiar circumstance&quot; entitling it to an adjustment of its units' initial legal regulated rent, is not inconsistent with either Rent Stabilization Law (Administrative Code of City of NY) &sect; 26-512 (b) (3), which provides that for housing accommodations not subject to either the Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 1974 (ETPA) or the Vacancy Decontrol Law of 1971 (VDL) the initial legal regulated rent shall be the rent reserved in the last effective lease or other rental agreement, or section 26-513 (a), which provides that the initial legal regulated rent may be adjusted in the presence of &quot;unique or peculiar circumstances.&quot; According to the plain language of section 26-512 (b) (3), the initial rent for all apartments that become regulated for any reason other than because they were previously deregulated by the VDL or were previously rent controlled but then vacated is not the market rent but the rent reserved in the previous lease. Accordingly, apartments in a building emerging from the Mitchell-Lama subsidized housing program, i.e., one not previously covered by either the ETPA or the VDL, may not have their initial legal regulated rent set at the market rate: to do so would contravene the stated goal of the Rent Stabilization Law as it would cause a drastic increase in the rents of existing tenants who had no control over their landlord's decision to opt out of Mitchell-Lama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Rent Regulation -- Building Emerging from Mitchell-Lama Program -- Initial Legal Regulated Rent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Apartments in a building emerging from the Mitchell-Lama subsidized housing program were not entitled to have their initial legal regulated rent set at the market rate on the ground that the regulated rents set under that program constituted &quot;unique or peculiar circumstances&quot; pursuant to Rent Stabilization Law (Administrative Code of City of NY) &sect; 26-513 (a). Although there may be relatively few such buildings when compared to all of the other types of multiple dwellings found throughout New York City, that fact does not permit the conclusion that the Legislature meant to afford a step-up to market rents based on the simple fact that a building had left the Mitchell-Lama program. Rather, the phrase &quot;unique or peculiar&quot; applies to situations which would not have been reasonably foreseeable to a landlord when forming its assumptions as to the initial rent it could charge under rent stabilization. It cannot be said that emerging from the Mitchell-Lama program was a &quot;unique&quot; or &quot;peculiar&quot; circumstance when a landlord's reasonable expectation, based on the clear language of Rent Stabilization Law &sect; 26-512 (b) (3), should have been that upon its emergence the initial regulated rent would be &quot;the rent reserved in the last effective lease or other rental agreement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Estoppel -- Estoppel against Government -- New York City Rent Regulation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a proceeding to invalidate a regulation of the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) providing that previous regulation of apartments in a multiple dwelling, in and of itself, shall not constitute &quot;a unique and peculiar circumstance&quot; thereby entitling the landlord to an adjustment of the initial legal regulated rent, DHCR was not estopped from taking the position that the emergence of a building from the Mitchell-Lama subsidized housing program did not constitute a unique or peculiar circumstance. Estoppel cannot serve to bar a governmental agency from exercising its governmental functions, and, in any event, a 1994 letter from a DHCR official which discussed the possibility that a former Mitchell-Lama building could argue that the very fact of past regulation constituted a &quot;unique or peculiar circumstance,&quot; was inconclusive. That letter expressly recognized the hypothetical and &quot;amorphous&quot; nature of the discussion and stated that it &quot;should not be construed as a[n] official statement of DHCR's position in any particular case.&quot; In the absence of proof of any official policy by DHCR, the agency should not be bound to what can at best be expressed as musings in response to requests for its position on the setting of initial rents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Bad Faith of Agency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In determining the request of a landlord for initial legal regulated rents for apartments in a building that was emerging from the Mitchell-Lama subsidized housing program, the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) did not act in bad faith by delaying consideration of the request until after DHCR adopted a regulation which provided that previous regulation of apartments in a multiple dwelling, in and of itself, did not constitute &quot;a unique and peculiar circumstance&quot; that would entitle the landlord to an adjustment of the initial legal regulated rent. The regulation did not change existing law; it merely clarified it. Accordingly, retroactive application of the regulation was not unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law as it then existed.</SPAN></P>

She received notification that she was eligible for Medicaid retroactively, but there was no indication of the number of hours of PCA services that the recipient was entitled to. Suit was filed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff owner of a marina sued defendants town and employees, seeking damages from allegedly improper proceedings brought against the owner. The Supreme Court, Westchester County (New York), entered summary judgment dismissing the causes of action to recover damages for malicious prosecution, abuse of process, negligent training and supervision, and violations of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1985(3). The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The owner alleged that the town's issuance of a stop work order, the bringing of an action seeking a permanent injunction, and criminal charges caused the owner, among other things, a loss of income. However, the appellate court found that the town and the employees established their prima facie entitlement to judgment as to the abuse of process claim by showing that the stop work order, appearance tickets, and the civil action were brought to accomplish the lawful purpose of requiring the owner to comply with the town code and not to obtain a collateral objective. The owner failed to raise a triable fact issue. Further, the owner's claims relying on alleged negligence did not support an abuse of process claim since it was an intentional tort. The denial of the town's motion for a preliminary injunction did not show that the civil action was ended in its favor, since that denial was not an adjudication on the merits. Also, that action was discontinued without prejudice by agreement of the parties. The town also presented evidence sufficient to establish its prima facie burden of entitlement to judgment as a matter of law dismissing the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The order was affirmed insofar as appealed from.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Process--Abuse of Process--What Constitutes.--Defendants, town and its code enforcement officer and fire inspector, were entitled to summary judgment dismissing causes of action alleging abuse of process; defendants demonstrated that they issued stop work order and appearance tickets, and commenced civil action seeking injunction, to accomplish lawful purpose of requiring plaintiff to comply with town code and not to obtain collateral objective; in opposition, plaintiff failed to raise triable issue, and its reliance on defendants' alleged negligent conduct could not support claim for abuse of process since it is intentional tort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Torts--Malicious Prosecution--Termination of Proceeding in Favor of Accused--What Constitutes.--In action alleging malicious prosecution based upon defendant town's commencement of underlying civil action against plaintiff seeking permanent injunction barring plaintiff from continuing to engage in certain construction work until plaintiff obtained requisite approvals and permits from town, denial of town's motion for preliminary injunction in underlying civil action did not demonstrate that civil action was terminated in plaintiff's favor, since that denial was not adjudication on merits; additionally, underlying civil action was discontinued without prejudice by agreement entered into by parties; thus, there was no termination of action favorable to plaintiff to support action for malicious prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Rights--Federal Civil Rights Claim.--Defendants, town and its code enforcement officer and fire inspector, were entitled to dismissal of causes of action alleging violations of 42 USC &sect;&sect;1983 and 1985 (3); town demonstrated that criminal charges brought against plaintiff, which plaintiff alleged violated its rights under 42 USC &sect;1983, did not result from policy, regulation, or custom of town; as for 42 USC &sect;1983 claims asserted against code enforcement officer and fire inspector, they were entitled to qualified immunity since it was objectively reasonable for them to believe that their acts did not violate clearly established constitutional or statutory rights regardless of whether they made mistakes of law or fact in applying town code; as for 42 USC &sect;1985 (3) claim, plaintiff failed to allege that defendants harbored class-based invidious discriminatory animus against particular group of individuals and that that prejudice motivated alleged wrongful conduct against plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff treasurer brought an interpleader suit against defendants client, girlfriend, and lawyers, seeking a determination as to who should receive bail funds. The client and the girlfriend counterclaimed. The Supreme Court, Delaware County (New York), inter alia, dismissed the counterclaims and directed the treasurer to release to the lawyers the bail money posted by the client. The client and the girlfriend appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The client and the girlfriend alleged that treasurer violated their Fourth Amendment rights by unreasonably withholding their money without authority. However, the appellate court found that the Fourth Amendment did not address unreasonably withholding property once a citizen voluntarily gave that property to the government, such as happened here, and those counterclaims were properly dismissed. The questions regarding the lawyers' intent required denial of summary judgment on the Judiciary Law &sect; 487 cause of action. As there was evidence that the lawyers' sent their letters in an effort to obtain payment of legal fees, they were entitled to summary judgment dismissing the prima facie tort cross claim because malevolence was not the lawyers' sole motive. However, the trial court erred in ordering the treasurer to release bail proceeds directly to the lawyers. Under General Municipal Law &sect; 99-m(1), bail was to be refunded to the person who originally posted it. The lawyers did not provide proof of a perfected transaction between the client and the lawyers through which the client intended to vest in the lawyers a present right to his bail proceeds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The order was modified by, inter alia, reversing the orders (1) denying the lawyers' cross motion for dismissal of the cross claims for prima facie tort and legal malpractice, (2) directing the treasurer to release bail proceeds to the lawyers, and (3) granting the lawyers' cross motion for summary judgment on its breach of contract claim against the client. The treasurer was directed to release the bail proceeds to the client.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bail--Exoneration of Bail--Unreasonable Withholding of Bail Does Not Constitute Unconstitutional Search and Seizure.--Counterclaims of defendants alleging that plaintiff county treasurer violated their US Constitution 4th Amendment rights by unreasonably withholding bail money they posted were dismissed; Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures of property but does not address unreasonably withholding property once citizen voluntarily gives that property to government, as plaintiffs did when they posted bail. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bail--Exoneration of Bail--Assignment of Cash Bail to Satisfy Attorney's Fee.--Court erred in ordering plaintiff county treasurer to release bail proceeds directly to attorneys who represented defendant in underlying criminal matter; by statute, when bail is exonerated, it is refunded to person who originally deposited such money (General Municipal Law &sect;99-m [1]); while person who posts bail can assign right to receive bail proceeds, attorneys did not provide proof of perfected transaction with defendant through which he intended to vest in them present right to bail proceeds; retainer agreement provided that defendant agreed to sign cash bail over to attorneys, but there was no written assignment and defendant did not endorse bail receipt over to attorneys; without proof of assignment, court should have directed plaintiff to release bail proceeds to defendant, original depositor or those funds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney and Client--Compensation--Ambiguous Fee Agreement.--Defendant attorneys were not entitled to summary judgment of breach of contract cause of action against defendant they represented in underlying criminal matter; pursuant to fee agreement, fee was to be paid at time of disposition of case if firm obtained &quot;disposition or resolution&quot;; attorneys represented defendant through entry of guilty plea, but defendant discharged them after plea and retained new counsel prior to sentencing; phrase &quot;disposition or resolution&quot; was ambiguous, as it could refer to guilty plea, which constitutes conviction, or sentencing, which results in judgment of conviction; ambiguity created question of fact concerning whether attorneys obtained &quot;disposition or resolution&quot; of defendant's criminal case so as to entitle them to minimum fee, or whether defendant discharged attorneys prior to disposition or resolution such that they could only recover fee on hourly basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff owners, and others, brought an action seeking a judgment declaring that New York City, New York, Tenant Protection Act, Local Law No. 7 of 2008 (Local Law 7), was unconstitutional and enjoining defendant city from enforcing the law. All parties moved for summary judgment. The Supreme Court, New York County (New York), denied the owners' motion and granted the city's motion, dismissing the complaint. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The owners argued that Local Law 7 improperly granted a type of authority to the Housing Part of New York City Civil Court that may only have been granted by the state legislature. The appellate court disagreed. Local Law 7 did not exceed the authority previously accorded to the Housing Part, but fell within the previously-defined jurisdiction of the Housing Part entitling it to enforce laws to establish and maintain housing standards. Having concluded that Local Law 7 did not impermissibly expand the jurisdiction of the Housing Part to hear claims of harassment against landlords, the appellate court also rejected the parallel argument that it impermissibly expanded the Housing Part's equitable jurisdiction. Local Law 7 was rationally related to a legitimate State objective, namely, maintaining rent-regulated housing in New York City. Preventing landlords from forcing tenants out by such means as refusing to make repairs, so they could have deregulated their buildings, was also rationally related to this goal. Moreover, Local Law 7 did not lack procedural safeguards for protecting landlords' due process rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Local Law No. 7 (2008) of the City of New York, which provides legal remedies for tenants experiencing harassment by landlords attempting to force them out, does not violate the State Constitution or usurp the authority of the State Legislature by modifying the jurisdiction of the Housing Part of the New York City Civil Court. The Housing Part has jurisdiction over the maintenance of &quot;housing standards&quot; (CCA 110), and although the CCA does not include a definition of that term, the creation of remedies for harassment of tenants by landlords is a matter that falls squarely within the concept of &quot;housing standards&quot; as the term has been understood and applied since the Act was enacted. Since such issues as whether a tenant's conduct was objectionable or constituted a nuisance have already been established to be within the jurisdiction of the Housing Part, and therefore necessarily an issue of &quot;housing standards,&quot; the equivalent issue of whether a particular landlord's conduct constitutes harassment must similarly be recognized as an issue of &quot;housing standards&quot; within the previously established jurisdiction of the Housing Part. &quot;Housing standards&quot; contemplates more than simply standards for the physical plant or condition of buildings.  </SPAN></P>

Inasmuch as Local Law No. 7 (2008) of the City of New York, which provides legal remedies for tenants experiencing harassment by landlords attempting to force them out, does not violate the State Constitution or usurp the authority of the State Legislature by modifying the jurisdiction of the Housing Part of the New York City Civil Court, it also does not impermissibly expand the Housing Part's equitable jurisdiction. CCA 110 (a) (4) authorizes the Housing Part to issue equitable relief such as restraining orders and injunctions in order to enforce &quot;housing standards,&quot; broadly construed. That authority was no more limited to proceedings involving the physical condition of buildings than the remainder of the authority granted by section 110 (a) to hear actions in order to enforce housing standards.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. The fact that Local Law No. 7 (2008) of the City of New York, which provides legal remedies for tenants experiencing harassment by landlords attempting to force them out, was incorporated into the Housing Maintenance Code did not render it improper or unconstitutional. The Code has not been strictly limited to governing matters of building structure, but was intended to protect a tenant's actual occupancy.  </SPAN></P>

Local Law No. 7 (2008) of the City of New York, which provides legal remedies for tenants experiencing harassment by landlords attempting to force them out, does not violate plaintiff landlords' substantive and procedural due process rights. It is rationally related to a legitimate State objective, namely, maintaining rent-regulated housing in New York City. Preventing landlords from forcing tenants out by such means as refusing to make repairs, so they can deregulate their buildings, is also rationally related to that goal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In a prosecution brought in the Supreme Court, Bronx County, New York, under the terrorism statute,&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 490.25, defendant was convicted by a jury of first-degree manslaughter as a crime of terrorism, attempted second-degree murder as a crime of terrorism, second degree criminal possession of a weapon as a crime of terrorism, and second-degree conspiracy. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In the course of a fight among members of rival gangs, defendant shot a child and a young man; the child died and the man became paralyzed. The appellate court held the evidence was insufficient to prove defendant committed his crimes with the intent to intimidate or coerce a &quot;civilian population&quot; generally, as opposed to members of rival gangs. The evidence showed that the shootings were intended to assert the gang's dominance over rival gangs and to pursue a vendetta against a specific gang. Members of other Mexican-American gangs in the area did not qualify as a &quot;civilian population&quot; under &sect; 490.25(1), and there was no evidence defendant intended to intimidate the broader community. His own statements sufficiently corroborated the testimony of his accomplice to satisfy CPL 60.22(1). Defense counsel, who obtained an acquittal on a second-degree murder charge, was not ineffective. Defendant's motion to suppress his statements to police at his apartment was properly denied, as police had consent to enter, and as he was not in custody, he had not been entitled to Miranda warnings. The conditions of his detention were not so unreasonable as to render his statements involuntary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The appellate court reduced the convictions for crimes of terrorism to the corresponding specified crimes as lesser included offenses and remitted the case to the trial court for resentencing on those counts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Terrorism - Intimidation of &quot;Civilian Population&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a prosecution arising out of defendant's shooting of a supposed rival gang member and a 10-year-old girl, the evidence was not legally sufficient to establish that defendant acted with the requisite intent to render his offenses crimes of terrorism. Even assuming that residents of a certain ethnicity in a particular area constituted &quot;a civilian population&quot; under Penal Law &sect; 490.25 (1), the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that defendant committed his crimes with the intent to intimidate or coerce that &quot;civilian population&quot; generally, as opposed to the much more limited category of members of rival gangs. The only purposes of defendant's actions were those of asserting his gang's dominance over rival gangs in general and pursuing a vendetta against a particular rival gang. While defendant's gang sometimes preyed on area residents who were not gang members, there was nothing to suggest that defendant's actions were motivated by the desire to intimidate a particular ethnic community in a certain geographic area. The crime of terrorism is not established unless the alleged terroristic intent is connected to the particular specified offense underlying the charge, and the &quot;civilian population&quot; to be intimidated must be some group other than the direct victims of the crime.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Terrorism -- Intimidation of &quot;Civilian Population&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a prosecution arising out of defendant's shooting of a supposed rival gang member and a 10-year-old girl, the evidence was not legally sufficient to establish that defendant acted with the requisite intent to render his offenses crimes of terrorism. Members of other rival gangs in the area in which defendant's gang operated did not qualify as &quot;a civilian population&quot; within the meaning of Penal Law &sect; 490.25 (1). The context of the Anti-Terrorism Act weighs against stretching the meaning of its language to cover such a narrowly defined subcategory of individuals. Rather, the Legislature intended to address extraordinary criminal acts perpetrated for the purpose of intimidating a broad range of people, not a narrowly defined group of particular individuals whom the criminal actor happens to regard as adversaries. A minimum size of &quot;a civilian population&quot; need not be defined where the legislative findings implied an intent to create a pervasively terrorizing effect on people living in a given area, directed either to all of those residents or those residents who are members of some broadly defined class, such as a gender, race, nationality, ethnicity or religion.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Corroboration of Accomplice Testimony -- Evidence Tending to Connect Defendant with Crime </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant was properly convicted of first-degree manslaughter, second-degree attempted murder, criminal possession of a weapon and conspiracy arising from his shooting of a supposed rival gang member and a 10-year-old girl based on the testimony an accomplice who was a leader of defendant's gang, because that testimony found support in &quot;corroborative evidence tending to connect the defendant with the commission of [the] offense[s]&quot; (CPL 60.22 [1]). The chief corroborating evidence was defendant's own statements he gave to the police in which he admitted his membership in the gang, placed himself at the scene of the crime and admitted having held a gun there.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Fair Trial -- Judge's Remarks at Voir Dire </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a prosecution for terrorism arising out of defendant's shooting of a supposed rival gang member and a 10-year-old girl, defendant was not deprived of a fair trial by the manner in which the court referred to the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001 (9/11). While it would have been preferable for the court to forgo the reference to jury service as a way to &quot;speak back&quot; to the 9/11 terrorists, it was highly unlikely that the jurors misinterpreted that hortatory rhetoric as an invitation to vindicate their own rage at the 9/11 terrorists by their treatment of defendant's case, thereby undermining the impartiality of the proceedings. Nothing in the court's remarks likened defendant to the 9/11 terrorists; on the contrary, the court specifically explained that defendant was not being charged with politically motivated terrorism. Significantly, the trial took place a full six years after 9/11, and defendant did not claim that anything the jurors learned of his background might have caused them to connect him to the 9/11 terrorists. Further, given the vast scale of the 9/11 catastrophe, the distinction between those attacks and the crimes charged was unmistakable.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Preservation of Issue for Review - Strategic Waiver </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Defendant was not entitled to a new trial in the interest of justice based on the introduction of numerous hearsay statements at his trial on charges stemming from his shooting of a supposed rival gang member and a 10-year-old girl. Defendant not only failed to raise any objections, but also affirmatively waived them and sought to use the evidence in question for his own strategic ends. Accordingly, defendant, through counsel, intelligently and knowingly waived his Confrontation Clause claims.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right to Counsel -- Effective Representation </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In a prosecution for terrorism arising out of defendant's shooting of a supposed rival gang member and a 10-year-old girl, the performance of defendant's lead trial counsel was not so deficient as to deny him effective assistance of counsel. In the absence of a complete record developed by a motion to vacate the judgment pursuant to CPL 440.10, it may be presumed that counsel exercised professional judgment and strategic discretion in determining how to conduct the defense. The existing record reflected that counsel followed a coherent strategy that sought to show that defendant committed no crime beyond weapon possession, a charge that he was unlikely to defeat given the denial of his suppression motion. Further, counsel competently attacked the credibility of the People's main witness, and brought out the inconsistencies between his testimony and that of other witnesses. Ultimately, counsel obtained an acquittal on the second-degree murder charge, the most serious count of the indictment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Preservation of Issue for Review - Inconsistent Verdict </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. In a prosecution for terrorism arising out of defendant's shooting of a supposed rival gang member and a 10-year-old girl, defendant's claim that the verdict was irreconcilably inconsistent insofar as he was convicted of attempted second-degree murder with respect to the supposed rival gang member who was paralyzed, while he was acquitted of the second-degree murder charge with respect to the girl, who was killed, was unpreserved as defendant failed to raise it before the jury was discharged. The failure to object to the verdict as inconsistent at the appropriate time may well have been a conscious tactical choice by defense counsel, since resubmitting the case to the jury to cure the inconsistency could have resulted in the acquittal on the murder charge being changed to a conviction. Accordingly, the claim was not reviewed in the interest of justice.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Confession -- Noncustodial Statements </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. In a prosecution arising out of defendant's shooting of two individuals, the police did not act improperly in entering defendant's apartment when they first approached him for questioning, since they entered the apartment with the implicit consent of an elderly man (apparently, defendant's stepfather) who met them at the door. The police did not have to give defendant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings when they began to interview him after he voluntarily accompanied them to the precinct, since a reasonable innocent person in defendant's situation would have believed, at the inception of the interview, that the police, who never displayed their weapons, were still in the process of gathering information about the alleged incident. Accordingly, the suppression court properly concluded that defendant was not in custody when the interview began and that the police were not required to read the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings at that point.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff on-line retailers (OLRs) appealed a judgment of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which dismissed their complaints, seeking a declaratory judgment that challenged the constitutionality of Tax Law &sect; 1101(b)(8)(vi), as amended on April 23, 2008, on commerce clause, due process, and equal protection grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The amendment to &sect; 1101(b)(8)(vi) required the OLRs to collect a sales and use tax on purchases made by New York residents. The trial court granted dismissal of the complaints under CPLR 3211(a)(2) and (7). On appeal, the court found that the facial challenges failed to state a cause of action. The court found no validity to a facial challenge based on the Commerce Clause under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8(3), as the tax collection obligation was only imposed on an out-of-state vendor where it entered into a business-referral agreement with a New York State resident, and only when that resident received a commission based on a sale in New York. Accordingly, the nexus requirement was satisfied. Due process facial challenges also failed, as the presumption created was not irrational and irrebuttable, and &sect; 1101(b)(8)(vi) was not void for vagueness with respect to various terms used therein. The as-applied challenges were ripe for review. However, issues of fact existed as to some of the as-applied challenges, including under the commerce and due process clauses. There was no showing of a viable equal protection claim under U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court modified the trial court judgment by declaring the statute constitutional on its face, and constitutional on its face and as applied with respect to the Equal Protection Clause. The matter was remanded for further proceedings with respect to the as-applied challenges under the due process and commerce clauses. The remainder of the trial court judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Presumption of Constitutionality -- Facial Challenge to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Facial challenges to a statute's constitutionality are disfavored. A plaintiff can only succeed in a facial challenge by establishing that no set of circumstances exists under which the act would be valid, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">i.e.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that the law is unconstitutional in all of its applications. Although language in a footnote in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">City of Chicago v Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (527 US 41, 55 n 22 119 S Ct 1849, 144 L Ed 2d 67 [1999]) might be interpreted to the effect that the &quot;no set of circumstances&quot; standard is not the appropriate test, in the absence of any unequivocal holding to the contrary, continued reliance on the &quot;no set of circumstances&quot; standard is warranted.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Collection of Sales Tax by Out-of-State Internet Vendors -- Nexus with Taxing State</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. On its face Tax Law &sect; 1101 (b) (8) (vi), which requires out-of-state vendors to collect sales or use taxes where they use in-state residents to solicit business from New York residents through Internet Web sites, does not violate the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution. It imposes a tax collection obligation on an out-of-state vendor only where the vendor enters into a business-referral agreement with a New York State resident, and only when that resident receives a commission based on a sale in New York. The statute does not target the out-of-state vendor's sales through agents who are not New York residents. Thus, the requirement that there be a substantial nexus with the taxing state is satisfied. Moreover, the statute requires that there be solicitation, not mere passive advertising by the in-state resident.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. On its face Tax Law &sect; 1101 (b) (8) (vi), which requires out-of-state vendors to collect sales or use taxes where they use in-state residents to solicit business from New York residents through Internet Web sites, does not violate the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution where the statute requires that there be solicitation, not mere passive advertising by the in-state resident. While the statute creates the presumption that the in-state agent will solicit on behalf of the vendor, it provides the out-of-state vendor with a &quot;safe harbor&quot;: the vendor merely has to include in its contract with the in-state vendor a provision prohibiting the in-state representative from &quot;engaging in any solicitation activities in New York State that refer potential customers to the seller,&quot; and the in-state representative must provide an annual certification that it has not engaged in any prohibited solicitation activities. However, the State has a legitimate basis to conclude that many in-state representatives will engage in direct solicitation, rather than mere advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Collection of Sales Tax by Out-of-State Internet Vendors -- Facial Challenge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A facial challenge by plaintiff, an out-of-state Internet vendor, to the constitutionality of Tax Law &sect; 1101 (b) (8) (vi) as violative of the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution failed inasmuch as there was a set of circumstances under which the statute would be valid. The challenged statute, which provides that out-of-state vendors must collect sales or use taxes where they use in-state residents to solicit business from New York residents through Internet Web sites, requires a substantial nexus between the vendor and the taxing state and a solicitation of business rather than mere passive advertising on the in-state residents' Web site. A program by plaintiff whereby commissions were given to in-state residents who directed business to it was not designed for the passive advertiser, but sought representatives looking to solicit business. Thus, until such time as the out-of-state vendor produced a certification from every one of its New York representatives that they had not engaged in solicitation, thereby bringing it within the &quot;safe harbor&quot; provision of the statute, the facial challenge based upon the Commerce Clause must fail. The statute would be valid where a New York representative used some form of proactive solicitation which resulted in a sale by plaintiff and a commission to the representative, and the representative had an in-state presence sufficient to satisfy the substantial nexus test.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Tax Law &sect; 1101 (b) (8) (vi), which requires out-of-state vendors to collect sales or use taxes where they use in-state residents to solicit business from New York residents through Internet Web sites, creates a not irrational presumption that in-state solicitation occurs when an in-state representative is paid a commission on a per sale basis after a New York purchaser accesses its Web site and &quot;clicks&quot; through to make a purchase at the out-of-state vendor's Web site. Solicitation in varying forms is an extremely plausible and likely avenue by which any competent businessperson would seek to improve revenues. In the event, however, the in-state representative wishes to chance success merely on luck and good fortune, without expending initiative, the statute permits it to offer proof that it did not engage in solicitation, and an implementing regulation provides that the proof can come in the form of a certification from the in-state representative that it did not engage in solicitation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Collection of Sales Tax by Out-of-State Internet Vendors -- Due Process Vagueness Claim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Tax Law &sect; 1101 (b) (8) (vi), which requires out-of-state vendors to collect sales or use taxes where they use in-state residents to solicit business from New York residents through Internet Web sites, is not unconstitutionally vague. The words &quot;or indirectly,&quot; used in referring to commissions paid by the out-of-state vendor, do not present any confusion. Since an in-state buyer can be referred by the in-state representative &quot;directly&quot; to the out-of-state vendor by a click on its Web site, the words &quot;or indirectly&quot; may mean referral by a manner other than a direct click, perhaps just by providing an e-mail address of the out-of-state vendor. In either case, the result is the same: a buyer has been routed to a seller by an intermediary. Neither are the words &quot;or other consideration&quot; in reference to commissions paid to the in-state resident vague. The statute simply provides that if there is some type of remuneration to the in-state representative other than a direct payment, the transaction will still be encompassed by the statute. Finally, the word &quot;solicitation&quot; is not so imprecise as to be unconstitutionally vague. While the Internet represents a significant change in communication, that fact does not require new definitions of terms that previously had a clear meaning: the maintenance of a Web site which the visitor must reach on his or her own initiative is not, under the statute or the advisory opinions of the Department of Taxation and Finance, a solicitation.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. A challenge to the constitutionality of Tax Law &sect; 1101 (b) (8) (vi), which requires out-of-state vendors to collect sales or use taxes where they use in-state residents to solicit business from New York residents through Internet Web sites, was ripe for judicial review where the Department of Taxation and Finance made clear its position that the statute applied to the activities of New York-based representatives of plaintiff Internet vendors taken on their behalf, and its intention to enforce the statute against them. Thus, the threat of harm to plaintiffs was &quot;direct and immediate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. A challenge to the constitutionality of Tax Law &sect; 1101 (b) (8) (vi), which requires out-of-state vendors to collect sales or use taxes where they use in-state residents to solicit business from New York residents through Internet Web sites, was not barred on the ground that plaintiffs, out-of-state Internet vendors subject to the statute, failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. There is an exception to the exhaustion requirement where a party is challenging the constitutionality or the basic applicability of a statute or regulation, and although that exception only applies where the issues are purely legal and do not require the resolution of factual issues, the circumstances herein were exigent enough to warrant review: plaintiffs were conducting an on-going business and required finality and clarity as to the extent of their present obligations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Where plaintiffs, out-of-state Internet vendors, challenged the constitutionality of Tax Law &sect; 1101 (b) (8) (vi), which requires out-of-state vendors to collect sales or use taxes where they use in-state residents to solicit business from New York residents through Internet Web sites, their claim that the statute, as applied, violated the Commerce Clause on the ground that plaintiffs' representatives did nothing more than advertise on New York-based Web sites could not be resolved because the Court could not conclude as a matter of law that plaintiffs' in-state representatives were engaged in sufficiently meaningful activity so as to implicate the State's taxing powers. Thus, given the limited, if nonexistent, discovery on the question, plaintiffs were afforded the opportunity to develop a record establishing whether their in-state representatives were soliciting business or merely advertising on their behalf. The Department of Taxation and Finance could find that plaintiffs' in-state representatives may have certified that they did not solicit business on plaintiffs' behalf, thereby coming within a &quot;safe harbor&quot; provision of the statute, yet engaged in activities that did constitute solicitation. The record did not permit a determination of whether the in-state representatives were engaged in activities which were &quot;significantly associated&quot; with the out-of-state vendors' ability to do business in New York.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. In two declaratory judgment actions challenging the constitutionality of Tax Law &sect; 1101 (b) (8) (vi), which requires out-of-state vendors to collect sales or use taxes where they use in-state residents to solicit business from New York residents through Internet Web sites, dismissal of the entire complaints was premature where plaintiffs raised an &quot;as applied&quot; due process challenge based on their contention that the statute was both irrational and irrebuttable as applied to them. Further discovery was warranted so that plaintiffs could make their record that all their in-state representatives did was advertise on New York-based Web sites. The determining factor was whether it was irrational to conclude that plaintiffs' agreements with New York-based Web sites, by which they compensated the New York-based Web sites in exchange for those Web sites' referral of customers to plaintiffs through Web links, were by their nature sufficient to establish that the New York-based Web sites would engage in other activity that went beyond mere advertising and amounted to solicitation--to such a level that would satisfy the Commerce Clause 's substantial nexus requirement--of New York business on plaintiffs' behalf. Moreover, it would be premature to find that even as applied the due process challenges were unavailing, whether because the statute created an illegal and irrebuttable presumption, or because its language was so vague that plaintiffs could not ascertain which transactions gave rise to their obligations to collect the sales tax.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. In a declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of Tax Law &sect; 1101 (b) (8) (vi), which requires out-of-state vendors to collect sales or use taxes where they use in-state residents to solicit business from New York residents through Internet Web sites, plaintiff, an out-of-state Internet vendor, failed to establish the existence of a viable as-applied equal protection claim. Plaintiff could not claim that it was being exclusively targeted since it was being treated exactly the same as another out-of-state Internet vendor which brought its own declaratory judgment action having a similar business program. Moreover, plaintiff could not claim that it was treated differently from those out-of-state retailers which do not have a business program like its own, since those retailers were not similarly situated. Thus, there was no proof that plaintiff was improperly singled out.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff owner appealed a judgment by the Suffolk County Supreme Court (New York) that, inter alia, denied his hybrid CPLR art. 78 petition to declare that the method of tax assessment imposed by defendants, town department of assessment and assessor, was invalid and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">When the department assessed the owner's property at the sum of $ 9,590 for the 2008/2009 tax year, the owner filed a grievance with the town's board of assessment review, alleging an excessive and unequal assessment, and seeking reduction of the assessment. After his grievance was denied, the owner commenced a small claims assessment review (SCAR) proceeding, which was denied for failure to prove that the assessed valuation exceeded the full value of his property. The trial court found that the owner's challenges were untimely, that a village was a necessary party, and that the determination of the hearing officer was supported by a rational basis. The appellate court found, inter alia, that the owner's challenges were timely and that the village was not a necessary party. However, the owner failed to establish that the full market value of his property, multiplied by the applicable equalization rate or residential assessment ratio, was less than the assessed valuation of his property, as required by RPTL 729(2)(a), 732(2). Therefore, the owner was not entitled to art. 78 relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment was modified by deleting the provision thereof dismissing the cause of action seeking a judgment declaring that the method of tax assessment imposed was invalid and unconstitutional; and, as so modified, the judgment was affirmed, and the matter was remitted for further proceedings on the owner's constitutional challenge to the assessor's methodology.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation--Assessment--Judicial Review.--Appellant timely commenced hybrid proceeding to review determination which denied his application to reduce tax assessment of his real property for tax year 2008/2009 and action for judgment declaring that method of tax assessment imposed was invalid and unconstitutional; court should have disregarded reference in petition/complaint to incorrect tax year as it was obvious mistake, and to disregard it would not prejudice substantial right of any party; moreover, appellant asserted timely challenges to assessment for 2008/2009 tax year at each stage of process, and then timely challenged Assessor's methodology in this proceeding; in any event, appellant also asserted claim pursuant to 42 USC &sect; 1983, which has three-year statute of limitations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties--Necessary Parties--Assessment Review.--Village was not necessary party in hybrid proceeding to review determination which denied appellant's application to reduce tax assessment of his real property and action for judgment declaring that method of tax assessment imposed was invalid and unconstitutional; appellant did not seek any relief from Village and only commenced small claims assessment review proceeding against Town Department of Assessment; in addition, no evidence was submitted to establish that Village's interest would be affected by outcome of proceeding requiring dismissal for failing to name it as party. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation--Assessment.--Court dismissed so much of petition/complaint as sought to annul hearing officer's determination in small claims assessment review proceeding; evidence, which included comparable recent sales and appellant's listing of property for sale at price in excess of full market value as determined by Assessor, provided rational basis for hearing officer's determination that appellant failed to establish that assessed valuation of his property exceeded its full value; although appellant submitted applicable residential assessment ratio (RAR), which is median percentage of value applied to residential property by assessing unit during preceding year, appellant failed to establish that full market value of his property, multiplied by applicable RAR, was less than assessed valuation of his property. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Respondent town department of public safety (the agency) appealed a judgment by the Suffolk County Supreme Court (New York) that granted petitioner owners' CPLR art. 78 petition and annulled the agency's revocation of the owners' accessory apartment permit; the owners claimed, inter alia, that the town's administrative tribunal lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After the owners obtained a permit to maintain an accessory apartment, in accordance with the permit, the agency issued them a notice of violation for the non-certified use and operation of a kennel on the premises. Following a hearing, the owners' accessory apartment permit was revoked for failure to comply with the town code, which required them to permit town officials to enter their property to determine whether the accessory apartment was in compliance with various codes. The appellate court found, inter alia, that the issue of whether the administrative tribunal had jurisdiction to adjudicate violations of the town code was a prerequisite to any additional determination as to the constitutionality of the accessory apartment law's warrantless search provisions. Since the area had been preempted by N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 3(a)(2) and Town Law &sect; 135(1), the administrative tribunal lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate a violation of the town's zoning code. Accordingly, the owners were entitled to art. 78 relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Appellate Division -- Reviewability</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In petitioners' CPLR article 78 proceeding to review the determination revoking their accessory apartment permit, in which the Supreme Court declined to reach the issue of whether the Town's Accessory Apartment Bureau (AAB) had jurisdiction to hear violations of the Town Code and elected to address the issue of whether the warrantless search provision of the Town Code's Accessory Apartment Law was unconstitutional, the issue of whether the AAB had jurisdiction to adjudicate violations of the Town Code was a prerequisite to any additional determination as to the constitutionality of the Accessory Apartment Law's warrantless search provisions which had to be addressed. Notwithstanding the contention that the issue of whether the AAB had jurisdiction to adjudicate violations of the Town Code was not properly before the Appellate Division, the Appellate Division could review petitioner's alternate basis for annulling the Hearing Officer's determination even though petitioners did not cross appeal from the judgment. Petitioners could not cross appeal from the judgment because they were not aggrieved thereby, since their petition was granted (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPLR 5511). Moreover, the Appellate Division can review the alternate ground for relief alleged in the petition as a basis for affirmance. In addition, the issue presented related to the lack of subject matter jurisdiction of the AAB, a ground for relief that could not be waived and could be raised at any stage of a proceeding.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Local Laws -- Preemption by State -- Town Administrative Tribunal Lacked Jurisdiction to Adjudicate Zoning Code Violations </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondent Town's Accessory Apartment Bureau (AAB), a quasi-judicial tribunal, lacked jurisdiction to determine whether petitioners' accessory apartment permit should be revoked due to their failure to consent to an inspection of their property for the purpose of determining whether the accessory apartment was in compliance with various codes as required by the Town's Accessory Apartment Law as a condition for the use of an accessory apartment. The administrative tribunal was an unconstitutional usurpation of the judicial function. The State has preempted local governments in municipalities of a certain size from adjudicating zoning code violations in an administrative tribunal, which would abrogate or supersede the jurisdictional framework created by the Legislature. The Legislature, acting in accordance with its constitutional authority to regulate the jurisdiction, practice and procedure of the courts (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art VI, &sect; 30) and by deeming zoning code violations to be offenses and misdemeanors (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Town Law &sect; 135 [1]), conferred jurisdiction over civil actions to enforce ordinance violations upon the District Courts (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;UDCA 203 [a]), and conferred jurisdiction over criminal enforcement actions upon the superior and local criminal courts (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 10.10 [3]; 10.20 [1]; 10.30 [1]). Furthermore, the Town, by virtue of its population, was not otherwise authorized to create its own tribunal for the purposes of code enforcement (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;General Municipal Law &sect; 380). Moreover, since the AAB was without jurisdiction to adjudicate a violation of the Town's zoning code and to revoke petitioner's accessory apartment permit, petitioners' constitutional challenge to the provision of the law requiring them to consent to warrantless searches of their property was rendered academic.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Necessary Parties -- Legislative Body Necessary Party in Proceeding Challenging Constitutionality of Legislative Act </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petitioners, whose accessory apartment permit was revoked by respondent Town's Accessory Apartment Bureau due to petitioners' failure to consent to an inspection of their property as required by the Town's Accessory Apartment Law as a condition for the use of an accessory apartment, were not entitled to declaratory relief in their CPLR article 78 declaring the provision of the law requiring warrantless searches to be unconstitutional, due to petitioners' failure to join the Town Board as a necessary party to the proceeding. In a matter seeking a declaratory judgment challenging a legislative act, the legislative body that enacted the challenged law or ordinance is a necessary party. Since the Town Board was not named as a party or joined, the Appellate Division could not exercise its authority pursuant to CPLR 103 (c) to convert the article 78 proceeding challenging the legislative act to a declaratory judgment action. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">defendant appealed an order by the Albany County Supreme Court (New York) that denied her CPL 440.10 motion to vacate her second-degree murder conviction without a hearing; defendant claimed that the conviction was obtained in violation of her due process rights, that the evidence was insufficient, and that she was entitled to retroactive application of the decisions regarding depraved indifference.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After giving birth unassisted at home in 1997, defendant put her newborn baby in a plastic bag and then placed the bag in a dumpster. She was convicted of depraved indifference murder under Penal Law &sect; 125.25(4). The appellate court found, inter alia, that at the time of defendant's trial, throughout her direct appeal, and until the time her conviction became final, the controlling case law provided that the phrase &quot;under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life&quot; constituted a &quot;factual setting&quot; in which the risk-creating conduct occurred, focusing &quot;upon an objective assessment of the degree of risk presented by defendant's reckless conduct. None changes in the depraved indifference murder standards applied as defendant's conviction became final before the changes in the law even began. In addition, the People proved all of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant's remaining contentions were considered and found to be unpersuasive. Consequently, defendant's CPL 440.10 motion to vacate was properly denied without a hearing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant's conviction for depraved indifference murder of a child became final 90 days after the Court of Appeals denied defendant's motion for leave to appeal the Appellate Division order affirming her conviction, as that was the date that defendant's time expired for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court. Defendant's application to the New York Court of Appeals for reconsideration did not extend the time in which to petition for certiorari.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Retroactive Application of Judicial Decision -- Depraved Indifference Murder </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The Court of Appeals established new law governing depraved indifference murder beginning in 2003, and while those new standards were formulated in cases involving convictions under Penal Law &sect; 125.25 (2), since the pertinent statutory language is the same in both subdivisions (2) and (4), i.e., &quot;under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life,&quot; the Court of Appeals' formulation of the new standards governing that language and its retroactivity were equally applicable to convictions under Penal Law &sect; 125.25 (4)--depraved indifference murder of a child.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Retroactive Application of Judicial Decision -- Depraved Indifference Murder</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Defendant's motion to vacate the judgment convicting her of depraved indifference murder of a child under Penal Law &sect; 125.25 (4) was properly denied. None of the changes in depraved indifference murder enunciated in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">People v Sanchez</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (98 NY2d 373, 777 NE2d 204, 748 NYS2d 312 [2002]) applied retroactively to defendant, whose conviction became final prior to those changes. The Court of Appeals has unambiguously stated that the new law should not be applied on collateral review to defendants whose convictions became final prior to the new interpretation of the law of depraved indifference murder. The language of CPL 440.10 (2) (a), which precludes collateral review of points previously determined on appeal except where there has been a retroactively effective change in the law controlling the issue, does not have a meaning independent of and greater than under common-law retroactivity principles. It is ultimately for the Court of Appeals to determine whether and to what extent a new state judicial precedent operates retroactively. Moreover, given the circumscribed purpose of the new rules, nonretroactivity posed no danger of a miscarriage of justice, and defendant did not demonstrate that federal constitutional principles required retroactive application to her case.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Murder -- Depraved Indifference Murder -- Collateral Attack on Judgment</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. On a motion to vacate the judgment convicting defendant of depraved indifference murder, the Appellate Division did not employ a deficient standard of review in affirming defendant's conviction on direct appeal. The Court determined that the People had proven all of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, notwithstanding that it did not parrot all aspects of the legal sufficiency review standards and analysis. Defendant was not entitled, in a collateral proceeding, to reargue legal sufficiency claims considered and rejected on her direct appeal under then-controlling precedents. Moreover, her challenge to Penal Law &sect; 125.25 (4) as unconstitutionally vague as applied to her was not raised before Supreme Court, was unpreserved for appellate review and lacked merit. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In a Mental Hygiene Law art. 10 proceeding brought by respondent State, following a jury verdict, the Supreme Court, Lewis County (New York), determined that respondent inmate was a dangerous sex offender requiring confinement and committed him to a secure treatment facility. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The inmate argued that he had a right to effective assistance of counsel and was denied that right. The appellate court found that, although this was a civil action, the fact that a commitment may have been indefinite and involuntary was an &quot;extraordinary circumstance&quot; affording the right to effective assistance of counsel. However, the inmate did not receive ineffective assistance. Counsel was not ineffective in stipulating that neither he nor the State's attorney would observe an exam conducted by the psychiatric examiner for the other party. The underlying issue was not resolved until after the stipulation was entered, and the inmate's attorney was not required to anticipate a change in the law. The inmate's claim that counsel failed to investigate his case was based on matters outside the record and thus was not before the appellate court. The inmate's claim that his attorney was ineffective for failing to argue that the report of the psychiatric examiner appointed for him should have remained private was meritless. Counsel was not ineffective in using a peremptory challenge to exclude a prospective juror who had known the inmate, rather than challenging him for cause.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A proceeding pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law article 10 to determine whether a respondent is a dangerous sex offender requiring confinement, although civil in nature in view of the legislative intent to treat rather than punish offenders (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mental Hygiene Law &sect;10.01), nonetheless requires that the respondent receive effective assistance of counsel. In the context of civil litigation, a contention concerning ineffective assistance of counsel will not be considered absent &quot;extraordinary circumstances.&quot; The potential of indefinite (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mental Hygiene Law &sect;10.09 [b], [f]) and involuntary civil confinement constitutes an &quot;extraordinary circumstance.&quot; Here, respondent, a repeat sex offender found by the court to be a dangerous sex offender requiring confinement in a secure facility following a jury verdict finding that he had a mental abnormality that predisposed him to commit further sex offenses (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mental Hygiene Law &sect;10.03 [i]; &sect;10.07 [d]), was not denied meaningful representation, viewing the evidence, the law and circumstances of the case as a whole and as of the time of the representation. Respondent's attorney was not ineffective in stipulating that neither party would observe any examination conducted by the other party's psychiatric examiner. The issue whether petitioner is permitted to attend the psychiatric examination of a respondent conducted on respondent's behalf in a Mental Hygiene Law article 10 proceeding was not resolved until after the subject stipulation was entered, and respondent's attorney was not required to anticipate a change in the law. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant ex-wife appealed the grant of summary judgment by the Supreme Court (Ulster County, New York) in favor of plaintiff homeowners' on their quiet title action by adverse possession or, alternatively, on res judicata and collateral estoppel grounds. The trial court found that the dismissal of the ex-wife's earlier action for failure to prosecute was entitled to res judicata and that the homeowners showed adverse possession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The ex-wife and her husband purchased the property at issue. She left without informing her husband that she was leaving or where she was going. He thereafter was granted a divorce upon her default. A subsequent action for partition of the marital residence likewise resulted in a default judgment in his favor and he was awarded fee title to the property. The following month, he conveyed the property by deed to the property owners. The ex-wife later challenged their title to the property. That action was dismissed. The homeowners continued to occupy the property and use it exclusively as their residence without interference for another 14 years. The appellate court held the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on res judicata grounds. Nevertheless, the homeowners were entitled to judgment quieting title to the land based on adverse possession. It was undisputed that they continuously possessed and exclusively occupied the property in question since the land was conveyed to them 23 years prior to the filing of the action. Throughout that time, they undertook numerous acts that were consistent with those of a property owner and sufficient to put defendant on notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Respondent town appealed and petitioner taxpayer cross-appealed an order and judgment by the Orange County Supreme Court (New York) that granted the taxpayer's motion to strike a portion of the town's trial appraisal report concerning certain easements, reduced the tax assessments for its property, and directed that any overpayments be refunded with interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The taxpayer's RPTL art. 7 petitions alleged that the town's assessments of its properties were illegal, unequal, and unconstitutional, resulting in overvaluation of its properties. The appellate court found, inter alia, that the opinion of the taxpayer's expert appraiser as to depreciation was reached by a recognized appraisal method based upon sound theory that was employed using objective data, which yielded substantial evidence of overvaluation. The taxpayer presented the testimony of a professional engineer who had the requisite knowledge with respect to analyzing reproduction cost. The trial court erred, however, in granting the taxpayer's motion to strike a portion of the town's trial appraisal report since the easements in question were not real property under RPTL 102(12) and, thus, were not separately assessable for tax purposes. While the easements were not subject to tax as real property, the costs of acquiring the easements were properly considered in calculating the reproduction cost of the subject transmission lines. The trial court also erred in assessing three tax parcels at a value less than that requested in the petition, in violation of RPTL 720(1)(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The cross-appeal was dismissed as abandoned, the appeal from the order was dismissed, the judgment was reversed, the motion to strike was denied, the order was modified accordingly, and the matter was remitted for further proceedings, and thereafter for a new determination on the petitions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation--Assessment.--In proceedings to review assessments of parcels consisting of gas and electric transmission lines, substations and switching station, petitioner rebutted presumption of validity of assessments through opinion of its expert appraiser as to depreciation, which was reached by (1) applying age-life approach using average service lives independently calculated after review of regional and national depreciation statistics databases, petitioner's own reported average services lives contained in submissions to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and opinion of expert professional engineer who inspected subject properties as to useful lives of subject properties, and (2) deducting for negative net salvage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Because defendant was upset with his former girlfriend, he stabbed her after encountering her on a street, causing her to suffer a lacerated liver and other injuries.

As a part of his plea allocution, defendant admitted that he had previously been convicted of first- and second-degree robbery. The trial court informed defendant that by entering into the plea, he was admitting his guilt to both the prior felony convictions, agreeing to a conviction as a mandatory persistent violent felony offender, and waiving his right to appeal. The appellate court found, inter alia, that defendant's valid waiver of his right to appeal precluded him from challenging the procedure used in sentencing him as a persistent violent felony offender. Defendant's contention that Penal Law &sect; 70.08(3)(c) violated the state and federal equal protection clauses was without merit.

Nonetheless, the actions were properly dismissed with prejudice because the owners failed to allege that the town took their property for public use or benefitted from the alleged invasion of their property. Accordingly, the complaint failed to state a cause of action against the town. In addition, since the town itself did not excavate or place fill in the navigable waters of the state without first obtaining the requisite permit, the owners did not have a cause of action against it to recover damages under Navigation Law &sect; 31.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner citizens brought a proceeding, pursuant to NY City Charter &sect; 1109, against respondent city council, requesting a summary judicial inquiry concerning the city council's practice of allocating funds to non-existent entities during its initial budgeting process. The Supreme Court, New York County (New York), dismissed the proceeding. The citizens appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The citizens argued that the practice of allocations to non-existent organizations, which had been publicly disclosed and discontinued, violated NY City Charter &sect; 100(c). However, the appellate court found that &sect; 1109's use of the word &quot;may&quot; gave the trial court discretion to determine when such an inquiry was called for or appropriate. Where the trial court justice declined to conduct the inquiry and articulated reasons for refusing to do so, the decision should not have been reviewed except where there was a clear abuse of discretion. The trial court furnished several legitimate reasons for denying the application. First, the practice of reserving funds in the name of non-existent organizations had been acknowledged and had received extensive publicity. Second, the trial court found that the ongoing investigation of the practice by United States Attorney's Office and the New York City Department of Investigation was sufficient to safeguard the public interest. The trial court also found that the practice of reserving funds was not the type of transgression that &sect; 1109 was designed to address. The trial court exercised its discretion appropriately in denying the application.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supreme Court did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners' request pursuant to New York City Charter &sect; 1109 that it conduct a summary judicial inquiry concerning the practice of the New York City Council of allocating funds to fictitious organizations during the initial budgeting process for the purpose of making later allocations to needy organizations. The charter provision, which states that a Justice of the Supreme Court &quot;may,&quot; upon a proper application, &quot;conduct a summary inquiry into any alleged violation or neglect of duty&quot; by government officials, vests the Supreme Court Justice with discretion to determine when such an inquiry is called for or appropriate. The decision to decline to conduct an inquiry should not be subject to judicial review unless there is a clear abuse of discretion. Here, Supreme Court furnished several legitimate reasons for denying the application, including the fact that the practice of reserving funds in the name of nonexistent organizations had been acknowledged and received extensive publicity in the media. In addition, the court found that the ongoing investigation of the practice by two governmental agencies was sufficient to safeguard the public interest. The court also found that the practice of reserving funds was not the type of municipal corruption the charter provision was designed to address. Petitioners otherwise failed to demonstrate what purpose would be served in requiring sworn testimony from past city officials about prior allocations of a small percentage of funds to legitimate community organizations. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The issue extant was whether the developers had viable claims based on the allegedly improper demands for money in lieu of parkland. The denial of the village's motion to amend the answer to assert a statute of limitations defense was proper. The alleged violations of the developers' constitutional rights were linked together and continuing, such that the statute of limitations for the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim was tolled up until the last violation, which occurred within the three-year limitations period. Further, those claims were not barred based on a failure to include them in the notice of claim. There was testimony at the hearing pursuant to General Municipal Law &sect; 50-h concerning the claims arising from the village's demands for money in lieu of parkland, which supplemented the notice. Moreover, there was no prejudice to the village's defense of the suit. The village failed to establish that there were no triable issues of fact concerning whether the developers had a constitutionally-protected property interest, and whether the village's conduct was arbitrary and irrational in the constitutional sense. However, some of the individual defendants were entitled to immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff possessor appealed a judgment by the Onondaga County Supreme Court (New York) that declared she did not have title to certain real property based on adverse possession pursuant to RPAPL art. 5; the possessor claimed that the 2008 amendments to art. 5 were unconstitutional as applied to her because they deprived her of a vested property right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The possessor claimed that she acquired title to the disputed property by adverse possession as early as 1985 in accordance with former RPAPL 501(2), CPLR 212(a). The appellate court found, inter alia, that the amendments to art. 5 became effective approximately six weeks before the possessor sought a judicial determination of her rights with respect to the disputed property, well after title to the disputed property had allegedly vested in her. Therefore, inasmuch as title to the disputed property would have vested in the possessor prior to the enactment of the 2008 amendments, application of those amendments to her was unconstitutional. Accordingly, because there were issues of fact whether the possessor acquired title to the disputed property by adverse possession prior to the effective date of the amendments, the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint on the merits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment was unanimously reversed, the declaration was vacated, the complaint was reinstated, the action for a declaratory judgment was converted to an action pursuant to art. 15, and the matter was remitted for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adverse Possession -- What Constitutes -- Actions Sufficient to Obtain Title by Adverse Possession -- Deprivation of Vested Property Rights by Application of 2008 Statutory Amendments</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supreme Court erred in applying the 2008 amendments to RPAPL article 5 (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> L 2008, ch 269, &sect;&sect; 5, 8 [eff July 7, 2008]) in declaring that plaintiff did not have title to certain real property surrounding her home based on adverse possession. The 2008 amendments, which became effective approximately six weeks before plaintiff sought a judicial determination of her rights with respect to the disputed property, abrogate the common law of adverse possession and define as &quot;permissive and non-adverse&quot; actions that, under the prior statutory law (RPAPL former 522) and long-standing principles of common law, were sufficient to obtain title by adverse possession, such as lawn mowing, landscaping and erecting sheds (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;RPAPL 543). Since, according to the facts set forth in the verified complaint and the supporting documentation submitted by plaintiff, her title to the disputed property would have vested long before the 2008 amendments to the adverse possession statute, application of those amendments to plaintiff's claim unconstitutionally deprived her of a vested property right. Where title has vested by adverse possession, it may not be disturbed retroactively by newly enacted or amended legislation. Consequently, plaintiff was entitled to the application of the version of article 5 in effect when her claim to the disputed property allegedly ripened into title. Since there were issues of fact whether plaintiff acquired title to the disputed property by adverse possession prior to July 7, 2008, Supreme Court erred in dismissing the complaint on the merits. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner State Psychiatric Association appealed an amended order by the Nassau County Supreme Court (New York) that denied its motion for summary judgment in its action for declaratory relief concerning the payment of Medicare Part B coinsurance amount for certain individuals pursuant to the 2006 amendment to Social Services Law &sect; 367-a(1)(d)(iii) and to determine that portions of the 2008 budget bill were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In 2006, the Legislature included licensed psychiatrists among the list of service providers who were entitled to receive 100% reimbursement of the Medicare deductible and coinsurance fees for dual eligible individuals in Social Services Law &sect; 367-a(1). However, the 2008 budget bill retroactively removed them from the list. The appellate court found, inter alia, that the attempt of the legislature in 2008 to modify the plain meaning of the 2006 amendment was unconstitutional as applied to the vested right of the Association's members to reimbursement, although the prospective change implemented in 2008 was permissible. Accordingly, the amended complaint/petition should have been dismissed only insofar as it concerned acts or omissions occurring more than four months before the action was commenced. The Association's art. 78 challenge was timely, its members had property rights in reimbursement at a 100% rate after March 31, 2007, and were entitled to reimbursement for claims arising between August 12, 2007, and April 11, 2008.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The principal issue was whether CPL 210.05 precluded the IDV Part of the Supreme Court from exercising jurisdiction to try misdemeanor charges absent an indictment or a superior court information. The appellate court held that it did not. Judiciary Law &sect; 211 provided the chief judge with constitutional authority to regulate the transfer of cases among the courts, and satisfied the &quot;as may be provided by law&quot; requirement of N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 19. Thus, there was no merit to the claim that a lack of legislative authority foreclosed the trial court's exercise of its removal power under the constitution. Defendant also argued that the transfer of his misdemeanor case violated CPL 210.05 because the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over the action by indictment or superior court information. However, CPL 210.05 was not intended to prohibit the Supreme Court from exercising its jurisdiction under the New York State Constitution, nor could it have. CPL 210.05 did not preclude the IDV Part of the trial court from exercising its jurisdiction under the New York State Constitution to try misdemeanor charges in the absence of an indictment or a superior court information.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Raising Issue for First Time on Appeal -- Challenge to Court's Jurisdiction</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. A challenge to the jurisdiction of the Integrated Domestic Violence Part of the Supreme Court to try misdemeanor charges against a defendant in the absence of an indictment or a superior court information may properly be raised for the first time on appeal. The preservation rule does not apply to errors that affect the organization of the court or the mode of proceedings prescribed by law. Defendant's contention that Supreme Court was not competent to entertain the action in the absence of an indictment or a superior court information as required by CPL 210.05 raised the issue of the court's jurisdiction and, thus, preservation was not required.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Removal to Superior Court -- Legislative Authority </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Judiciary Law &sect; 211, as implemented by the rules promulgated by the Chief Judge and the Chief Administrative Judge pursuant to authority derived from the New York State Constitution, provides statutory authority for the transfer of misdemeanor cases to Integrated Domestic Violence Parts of the Supreme Court pursuant to NY Constitution article VI, &sect; 19 (a), which gives the Supreme Court the authority to transfer cases to itself &quot;[a]s may be provided by law.&quot; In view of the phrase &quot;[a]s may be provided by law,&quot; the power of removal conferred by article VI, &sect; 19 (a) is not self-executing. However, Judiciary Law &sect; 211 satisfies the &quot;[a]s may be provided by law&quot; requirement of article VI, &sect; 19 (a). Therefore, the Supreme Court's exercise of its removal power under that constitutional provision was not foreclosed by a lack of legislative authority.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurisdiction of Offenses -- Trial of Misdemeanors in Supreme Court Absent Indictment or Superior Court Information </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. CPL 210.05 does not preclude the Integrated Domestic Violence (IDV) Part of the Supreme Court from exercising its jurisdiction under the New York State Constitution to try misdemeanor charges against a defendant in the absence of an indictment or a superior court information. IDV Parts were administratively created to hear and determine domestic violence cases in a single forum. CPL 210.05 merely prescribes the method and manner required for a prosecutor to prosecute an offense in a superior court, rather than imposing a limitation on the superior court's constitutional jurisdiction over such a case. Therefore it was not intended to prohibit the Supreme Court from exercising its jurisdiction under the New York State Constitution, nor could it. Once defendant's case was transferred to the IDV Part pursuant to Judiciary Law &sect; 211, as implemented by the rules promulgated by the Chief Judge and the Chief Administrative Judge pursuant to authority derived from the New York State Constitution, it was properly handled pursuant to the appropriate substantive and procedural rules of that court. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff attorneys appealed an order by the Albany County Supreme Court (New York) that dismissed their claims against defendants, Comptroller and New York State and Local Employees' Retirement System.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In April 2008, the Comptroller announced new regulations that invalidated the attorneys' memberships in the Retirement System. As a result, the attorneys sought declaratory and injunctive relief. They claimed that the defendants had no authority to investigate, reduce, or terminate their retirement benefits and that the procedures used by the defendants were contrary to statute and in violation of N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 7. The appellate court found, inter alia, that, pursuant to a prior case, the attorneys were restored all of their service credits and were guaranteed the right to a timely hearing and a predetermination of their membership status in the Retirement System even though they had not yet applied for retirement. Accordingly, the attorneys' claims pertaining to the alleged deprivation of their due process rights were rendered moot and their remaining arguments were premature. Inasmuch as the attorneys' proposed amended complaint would have been dismissed in its entirety, their challenge to the denial of their CPLR 3025(b) motion to amend was also moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The order was modified by reversing the denial of the defendants' cross-motion with respect to the causes of action that were converted into a proceeding pursuant to CPLR art. 78, and by dismissing said causes of action; and, as so modified, the order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts--Ripeness Doctrine--Right to Public Pension Benefits.--In action arising out of dispute between plaintiffs, attorneys claiming entitlement to public pension benefits for their work as counsel to municipalities while at same time maintaining private law practices, and defendants, entities investigating propriety of those claims, certain of plaintiffs' due process claims and plaintiffs' arguments that unilateral revocation of their membership in Retirement System was unconstitutional were premature since, in light of order issued in related case, plaintiffs' service credits were restored and they were guaranteed right to timely hearing and predetermination of their membership status in Retirement System even though they had not yet applied for retirement--likewise, challenges to validity of new rules insofar as they were applied to determine that plaintiffs were independent contractors instead of employees or applied to diminish earned credits, as well as cause of action protesting retroactive application of new rules to plaintiffs, were not ripe for judicial review inasmuch as result and propriety of application of new rules to these plaintiffs was not yet finally determined. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The issue on appeal was whether the establishment of the trial court by administrative decree was proper. The appellate court held that it was not. N.Y. Const. art. VI vested judicial authority in a unified court system. In transferring all cases charging a class A misdemeanor to the trial court, causing a collapse of the constitutionally created Criminal Court of the City of New York in the Bronx, the Chief Judge and Chief Administrator overstepped their authority under N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect;&sect; 19(a), 28, and Judiciary Law &sect;&sect; 211, 212, and impinged on the legislature's reserved primary power to alter and regulate jurisdiction, practice, and procedure under N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 30. The impact of the establishment of the trial court and the transfer of all Bronx County criminal cases charging class A misdemeanors under N.Y. R. Chief Admin. Off. Ct. pt. 142 far exceeded the routine operation and administration of the Unified Court System contemplated by &sect; 28(c), &sect; 211(1)(a), and &sect; 212(1)(c). Since the Chief Administrator was without authority to order the transfer, the trial court never acquired jurisdiction to try and sentence defendant under a misdemeanor information.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law--Separation of Powers--Authority of Chief Judge and Chief Administrator to Promulgate Rules to Provide for Transfer of Cases to Criminal Division of  of Bronx County.--In transferring all cases charging class A misdemeanor to newly created Criminal Division of  of Bronx County, through promulgation Rules of Chief Judge (22 NYCRR) part 42 and Rules of Chief Administrator of Courts (22 NYCRR) part 142, causing collapse of constitutionally created Criminal Court of City of New York in Bronx, Chief Judge and Chief Administrator overstepped bounds of administrative and operational authority they possess under State Constitution, article VI, &sect; 28 and &sect; 19 (a), and Judiciary Law &sect;&sect; 211 and 212, and impinged on Legislature's reserved primary power to alter and regulate jurisdiction, practice and procedure under State Constitution, article VI, &sect; 30. </SPAN></P>

The department argued that the application of &sect; 72 was restricted to situations in which an employer sought to place an employee currently working on involuntary leave. The department also argued that 4 NYCRR 21.3(e) and the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) applied, to the exclusion of &sect; 72, because the employee was already on voluntary sick leave and wanted to return to work. The appellate court agreed. Based on the plain language of &sect; 72, especially when read in juxtaposition to the language of 4 NYCRR 21.3, the former was intended to apply to active employees, whereas the latter applied to employees already on voluntary sick leave. To conclude otherwise would, among other things, have rendered portions of 4 NYCRR 21.3 and the CBA entirely superfluous.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The university sought to obtain certain property on its own and thereafter joined with the condemnor to obtain the rest. The estimated acquisition and construction cost for the project were to be funded by the university without any contribution from any municipal entity. The court found, inter alia, that the condemnor's determination of a public use, benefit, or purpose for the project was wholly unsupported by the record and precedent. The blight designation was mere sophistry. The true beneficiary of the scheme to redevelop the property was not the community that was supposedly blighted, but rather the university. The condemnor intentionally limited the administrative record by arbitrarily closing it, while simultaneously withholding documents that the owners were legally entitled to receive. As a result, the condemnor's actions deprived the owners of a reasonable opportunity to be heard under EDPL 203 and violated their due process rights under amend. XIV, and &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff owner appealed an order by the Rockland County Supreme Court (New York) that granted summary judgment to defendants, sheriff and sheriff department, in his action, inter alia, to recover damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and denied his motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability for the destruction of his weapons and shooting accessories.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Pursuant to a temporary order of protection, the owner surrendered three handguns, three rifles, a shotgun, and shooting accessories that he owned to the sheriff's department. When he subsequently returned to the sheriff's department to reclaim his property, he learned that it had been destroyed, purportedly in accordance with the applicable statutory scheme. The appellate court found, inter alia, that although the destruction of the owner's handguns was permissible and in compliance with the applicable statutes as they existed at the time, the destruction of the owner's rifles, shotgun, and shooting accessories was not authorized under Penal Law &sect; 400.05(6), as they were not &quot;firearms&quot; within the meaning of Penal Law &sect; 265.00(3). Accordingly, the owner's &sect; 1983 action was properly brought against the sheriff's department since it was acting under color of law when it deprived the owner of his protectable property interest. However, the sheriff was entitled to qualified immunity since he would not have known that disposing of the owner's rifles, shotguns, and shooting accessories violated the owner's clearly established statutory or constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The order was modified, inter alia, by granting the owner's motion for summary judgment and by denying the department's motion on the issue of liability; and, as so modified, the order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant Sheriff's Department was liable to plaintiff pursuant to 42 USC &sect; 1983 for violating plaintiff's right to procedural due process under the law by wrongfully destroying the rifles, shotgun, and shooting accessories that plaintiff had surrendered in compliance with a temporary order of protection issued pursuant to Family Court Act &sect; 842-a. The handguns that plaintiff surrendered were lawfully destroyed in accordance with the version of Penal Law &sect; 400.05 (6) then in effect, since those weapons were classified as &quot;firearms&quot; within the meaning of Penal Law &sect; 265.00 (3) that defendant was authorized to destroy because they were not reclaimed within one year of their surrender. However, the remaining items were not similarly categorized as &quot;firearms,&quot; and defendant was thus not authorized to destroy them, regardless of plaintiff's failure to reclaim them within one year. Plaintiff's claim was otherwise properly brought against the Sheriff's Department, which was acting under color of law when it deprived plaintiff of his protectable property interest in the items he surrendered. Plaintiff sufficiently demonstrated that there was a municipal policy or custom of disposing of weapons surrendered in accordance with Family Court Act &sect; 842-a, regardless of whether they fit the statutory definition of &quot;firearms.&quot; Furthermore, due process was not satisfied by Family Court Act &sect; 842-a (7), which only provided plaintiff with the right to a hearing to contest the surrender order, and did not afford him any notice that his property would be destroyed.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant Sheriff was not liable to plaintiff pursuant to 42 USC &sect; 1983 for wrongfully destroying the rifles, shotgun, and shooting accessories that plaintiff had surrendered in compliance with a temporary order of protection issued pursuant to Family Court Act &sect; 842-a. The Sheriff was entitled to qualified immunity in his individual capacity because he would not have clearly recognized that destroying plaintiff's rifles, shotgun and shooting accessories was unlawful. The items were surrendered pursuant to a Family Court order, and the version of Penal Law &sect; 400.05 (6) then in effect appeared to provide that such items could be disposed of after one year's time. A reasonable official in this circumstance would not have known that Penal Law &sect; 400.05 (6), although authorizing the destruction of plaintiff's handguns, actually excluded rifles and shotguns, and therefore would not have known that disposing of the weapons violated clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known. </SPAN></P>

The SDHR appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The SDHR sought to investigate complaints that two male students were the victims of gender discrimination in the way the school district had disciplined them for an altercation. Ultimately, the SDHR issued an initial determination that it had jurisdiction to conduct the investigations. The school district then brought this proceeding alleging that the SDHR lacked jurisdiction to investigate claims against it under Executive Law &sect; 296(4) because it was not an education corporation or association as contemplated by that statute, and sought a writ of prohibition. The appellate court found that the school district had not exhausted its administrative remedies in that the hearing process was not completed. In the context of that administrative proceeding, the school district could have challenged the applicability of &sect; 296(4) and, at the same time, mounted a defense to the discrimination charges. Once a final determination was issued, the school district, if necessary, had the opportunity to raise these issues in a challenge to SDHR's final determination. In addition, it was by no means certain that the SDHR would not find for the school district as to the discrimination charges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner residents sought to prohibit respondent candidate's name from being placed on the ballot for a town justice seat. The candidate cross-petitioned, among other things, to validate his designating petition. The Supreme Court, Suffolk County (New York), denied the residents' petition, dismissed the proceeding, and granted that branch of the cross petition which was to validate the designating petition.

The town justice was also required to serve as a member of the town board. The residents objected to the candidate on the ground that he did not meet the residency requirement. The trial court held that the person elected to the seat was required to meet the residency requirement within 30 days after the commencement of the term of office, by January 30, 2010, rather than at the time the designating petition was filed. The candidate first claimed that the residency requirement was unconstitutional. The appellate court disagreed. However, the trial court erred in finding that the candidate would not have been required to meet the constitutional and statutory requirements of the office until 30 days after the commencement of the term of office. In light of the unique dual role of the public office, requiring the office holder to serve not only as a town justice, but as a member of the town board, the earlier date provided for by Election Law &sect; 6-122(3) applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner former owner and proposed petitioner current owner appealed an order and judgment by the Westchester County Supreme Court (New York) that dismissed the former owner's proceeding insofar as asserted against respondents, city and tenants, as time-barred and for lack of standing, and denied the current owner's cross-motion to be substituted as the petitioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">While a petition for administrative review was pending, the former owner conveyed one of its buildings to the current owner. Thereafter, the former owner commenced a hybrid proceeding pursuant to CPLR art. 78 to compel the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) to render an administrative determination as to the rent regulatory status of the building and an action for a declaration that the city's resolution was arbitrary, unreasonable, and unconstitutional to the extent that it determined that the building was subject to the Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 1974, L 1974, ch. 576. The appellate court found, inter alia, that contrary to the trial court's determination, a declaratory judgment action rather than a proceeding pursuant to art. 78 was the proper vehicle for resolving the challenge to the resolution. Accordingly, the proceeding was governed by the six-year catch-all limitations period of CPLR 213(1) and was timely interposed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Upon defendant's guilty plea to attempted robbery in the second degree, the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), convicted him and imposed sentence. Later defendant moved, pursuant to CPL 440.10, 440.20, to vacate his conviction and set aside his sentence. This motion was denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">At the plea proceeding, defendant was adjudicated a second violent felony offender because of a prior Maryland conviction for abducting a child under 12 years old. Defendant admitted to the Maryland conviction, and, after conferring with counsel, answered in the negative when asked if he was making a constitutional challenge to the Maryland conviction. Defendant argued that his conviction and sentence should have been set aside because he was actually not a predicate violent felony offender, that he pleaded guilty under the mistaken belief he was, and that his guilty plea was therefore involuntary. Defendant also claimed that his attorney was ineffective for not challenging his predicate violent felony adjudication at the plea proceeding. The appellate court found that, because defendant failed, during the plea proceedings, to raise the issue of whether the statute under which he was convicted in Maryland was the equivalent of a New York violent felony, he waived that issue. Under the circumstances, the appellate court declined to set aside the plea bargain. Alternatively, the appellate court found that defendant was properly adjudicated a second violent felony offender.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Sentence--Second Violent Felony Offender.--Defendant was properly adjudicated second violent felony offender on basis of prior Maryland conviction for crime of abducting child under 12 years old, which was equivalent to New York felony kidnapping; defendant failed to preserve issue as to whether predicate felony statement was facially defective because Maryland conviction it identified occurred more than 10 years prior and it did not set forth term of incarceration that could be used to toll 10-year limitation period under Penal Law &sect; 70.04; moreover, as defendant's period of incarceration for Maryland conviction satisfied 10-year limitation period, any failure to list tolling period on predicate felony statement was harmless. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Erie County Court (New York) that convicted him of first-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance and third-degree assault; defendant claimed that because his extended detention at a roadside traffic stop was unconstitutional, the trial court erred in refusing to suppress the evidence seized as a result thereof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant's vehicle was pulled over for excessively tinted windows, in violation of Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 375(12-a)(b)(2). Even though the deputies had the information necessary for issuing a traffic ticket based on that violation, they detained defendant for further investigation based on defendant's nervous appearance, their &quot;gut&quot; feelings, and their experience as narcotics officers. Thereafter, one of the deputies allegedly observed crumbs of crack cocaine on defendant's right palm. After directing defendant to exit the vehicle, a struggle ensued, and one of the deputies was injured. A subsequent inventory search of the vehicle disclosed 8.892 ounces of cocaine. The appellate court found, inter alia, that although the initial seizure was justified, the length and circumstances of the ensuing detention were not. Defendant's alleged nervousness did not, by itself, provide the requisite reasonable suspicion of criminality to justify the extension of the traffic stop. Accordingly, because the deputies were not engaged in the performance of a lawful duty, the assault, resisting arrest, and obstructing governmental administration charges should have been dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff senators sued defendants governor, secretary of state, and nominee for the office of lieutenant-governor, challenging the governor's appointment of the nominee as lieutenant-governor. The Supreme Court, Nassau County (New York), inter alia, preliminarily enjoined the nominee from exercising the powers of the office of lieutenant-governor. The governor, secretary of state, and nominee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The governor argued that a quo warranto proceeding brought by the attorney general was the exclusive method to challenge the appointment. However, the appellate court found that nothing showed that the attorney general intended to take an active role and that the public interest required that the issues be addressed. A declaratory judgment action and injunctive relief was a proper way to challenge the appointment. The senators had standing. The governor did not have the authority to appoint a lieutenant-governor, and his purported appointment could not have been reconciled with N.Y. Const. art. IV, &sect; 6. No considerations of the state's financial difficulties or of the senate's political strife authorized the appointment. Public Officers Law &sect; 43 did not authorize the governor to fill a vacancy, but only to appoint a person to execute the duties of the office until the vacancy was filled by election. Public Officers Law &sect; 43 could not have been constitutionally applied to a vacancy in the lieutenant-governor office. As the statute could not have been reconciled with the Constitution as far as the lieutenant-governor's office, it yielded. The purported appointment was unlawful.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. An action for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief brought by members of the New York State Senate was a permissible way to challenge the constitutionality of the Governor's appointment of an individual to fill a vacancy in the office of lieutenant governor. A quo warranto proceeding brought by the Attorney General (Executive Law &sect; 63-b) was not the exclusive method by which the lawfulness of the Governor's appointment could be challenged inasmuch as there were no disputed issues of fact to be tried and only an issue of law was presented.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing -- Challenge to Governor's Appointment of Lieutenant Governor to Fill Vacancy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Plaintiffs, members of the New York State Senate, had standing to maintain an action for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief challenging the Governor's appointment of an individual to fill a vacancy in the office of lieutenant governor. Plaintiffs adequately alleged an injury-in-fact that fell within their zone of interest and showed an actual legal stake in the matter sufficient to establish their standing in view of the lieutenant governor's role as the Senate's presiding officer (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art IV, &sect; 6) and because the lieutenant governor also has a casting vote in the Senate to break a tie on certain matters.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trial -- Place of Trial -- Challenge to Governor's Appointment of Lieutenant Governor to Fill Vacancy -- Injunctive Relief </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. An action for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief challenging the Governor's appointment of an individual to fill a vacancy in the office of lieutenant governor could properly be maintained in Supreme Court, Nassau County. CPLR 6311 (1), which provides that a &quot;preliminary injunction to restrain a public officer ... from performing a statutory duty may be granted only by the supreme court at a term in the department in which the officer ... is located or in which the duty is required to be performed,&quot; did not require that the action be brought in the Supreme Court at a term in the Third Judicial Department. If the Governor's appointment was not lawful, CPLR 6311 would not apply because the appointee would not be a public officer. If the appointee was lawfully appointed, plaintiffs proffered no grounds to restrain his performance of the duties of that office.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Governor -- Powers of Governor -- Authority to Appoint Lieutenant Governor to Fill Vacancy </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. The Governor lacked authority pursuant to Public Officers Law &sect; 43 to appoint an individual to fill a vacancy in the office of lieutenant governor. NY Constitution, article IV, &sect; 6 provides that where a vacancy occurs in the office of lieutenant governor, the temporary president of the Senate shall perform all the duties of that office. Consequently, Public Officers Law &sect; 43, which authorizes the Governor to fill a vacancy in an elective office until the vacancy is filled by election, could not be constitutionally applied with respect to a vacancy in the office of lieutenant governor. The Governor's purported appointment was unlawful because no provision of the Constitution or of any statute provides for the filling of a vacancy in the office of lieutenant governor other than by election, and only the temporary president of the Senate is authorized to perform the duties of that office during the period of the vacancy. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff judges sought review of an order from the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which granted a motion by defendants, the New York Governor and other State officials, to the extent of dismissing the complaint regarding judge compensation against the Governor and dismissing a claim under N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 25(a) entirely. Defendants appealed the grant of summary judgment to the judges on a separation of powers claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judges sought declaratory and injunctive relief based on the failure to enact any enhancement in compensation for members of the state judiciary within the prior 10-year period. The lack of increase, despite multiple efforts to do so, allegedly violated &sect; 25(a). Further, the judges claimed that defendants engaged in &quot;linkage&quot; when legislatively considering judicial pay raises. The trial court dismissed all claims against the Governor, as he acted within his authority, it dismissed the claim under &sect; 25(a), and it granted summary judgment on the separation of powers claim. On appeal, the court agreed that the Governor had acted appropriately and had no liability. Further, inflation and the escalation in the cost of living did not &quot;diminish&quot; judicial compensation for purposes of &sect; 25(a) in the face of legislative inaction. Accordingly, dismissal of the Compensation Clause claim was proper. The Speech or Debate Clause, N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 11, did not shield defendants from review of the separation of power claim on the issue of linkage. The legislature's linkage of the judicial compensation issue with compensation for legislators violated the doctrine of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Governor -- Powers of Governor -- Challenge to Legislature's Failure to Increase Judicial Compensation </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Governor was not properly part of an action challenging the Legislature's failure to increase judicial compensation due to political conflicts between the executive and legislative branches of state government involving the linkage of salary increases for judges to increases for legislators. There was no evidence that the Governor exceeded his authority, or thwarted either the enactment of judicial pay raise legislation or the expenditure of appropriated funds for judicial compensation. Rather, the Governor facilitated the process by bringing the issue of judicial salaries to the Legislature by means of submitting the Judiciary's budget request to the Legislature unchanged, as he was required to do, and with his approval. The fact that the Legislature reacted by refusing to enact a judicial pay increase could not be attributed to the Governor.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Judicial Salaries -- Legislature's Failure to Increase Judicial Compensation -- Compensation Clause </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The failure of the Legislature to increase judicial compensation due to political conflicts between the executive and legislative branches of state government involving the linkage of salary increases for judges to increases for legislators did not violate the constitutional prohibition against the diminution of judicial compensation (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 25 [a]). The loss of purchasing power due to inflation since the last judicial salary adjustment did not &quot;diminish&quot; judicial compensation by reducing wages or benefits in any direct fashion within the meaning of the constitutional prohibition. The indirect impact of inflation on judicial salaries is not unique to, or targeted at, the Judiciary. The Compensation Clause neither offers complete protection of the purchasing power of judicial salaries nor mandates cost of living adjustments to offset inflation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Legislature -- Immunity from Prosecution -- Immunity under Speech or Debate Clause Not Available in Action Challenging Legislature's Failure to Increase Judicial Compensation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Legislative immunity by operation of the Speech or Debate Clause (NY Const, art III, &sect; 11) was unavailable to shield defendants from plaintiffs' separation of powers claim in an action challenging the Legislature's failure to increase judicial compensation due to political conflicts between the executive and legislative branches of state government involving the linkage of salary increases for judges to increases for legislators. While individual statements of legislators or legitimate legislative acts may be immunized, it does not automatically follow that the manner in which legislative decisions are made is similarly protected. The practice of linkage is not an inherently legislative function protected from a judicial challenge to the manner in which it is employed. Rather, linkage as applied was merely a legislative custom that served no legitimate legislative purpose other than to facilitate the personal remunerative goals of the Legislature's members. The intragovernmental dispute regarding judicial and legislative compensation went beyond the boundaries of the Legislature's internal communications, debates, committee work, investigations and other similar functions which rest within the legislative sphere. Under these circumstances, it could not be concluded that judicial review of this constitutional challenge was barred by operation of the Speech or Debate Clause.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Judicial Salaries -- Legislature's Failure to Increase Judicial Compensation -- Separation of Powers Doctrine </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The failure of the Legislature to increase judicial compensation due to political conflicts between the executive and legislative branches of state government involving the linkage of salary increases for judges to increases for legislators violated the doctrine of the separation of powers. The legislative action in making a judicial salary increase contingent on achieving a legislative pay increase threatened the independence of the judicial branch of government. The political branches of government must discharge the responsibility of considering, and acting upon, an enhancement in judicial salaries on its objective merit. Linkage, as applied in these circumstances, manifested an abandonment of any pretense to an objective consideration of judicial compensation unimpeded by extraneous political considerations. These acts and their ramifications necessarily undermined New York's constitutional framework of government, which prohibits the subordination of the judicial branch to other branches of government either in practice or in principle. Moreover, evidence of a present impairment of the judicial system was not a prerequisite to the viability of the separation of powers claim. The constitutional defect was predicated on the manner in which the linkage distorted the relationship among the branches of government.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Respondent, the birth mother of a 12-year-old child, filed an action seeking to have appellant, the mother's former same-sex partner, adjudicated a parent of the child, and an award of child support retroactive to the child's birth. A support magistrate granted the partner's motion to dismiss the action. The Family Court, Rockland County, New York, granted the mother's objections to the magistrate's order. The partner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The mother alleged that she and her partner had agreed that the mother would become impregnated by anonymous sperm donation; that they would raise the child together; that after the child was born, the partner nurtured and cared for him for a few months; that the partner then ended the parties' relationship; and that she refused all requests for child support. The appellate court noted that the family court's order was not an order of disposition and, hence, not appealable as of right; however, under the circumstances, it treated the notice of appeal as an application for leave to appeal, and granted leave. The magistrate properly granted the partner's motion to dismiss the petition on the ground that the family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the mother's application. The family court only had jurisdiction under Family Ct Act art. 5 to resolve controversies concerning a male's fatherhood of a child. As the family court had no constitutional or statutory to determine a female's paternity of a child, and had no power to grant equitable relief, it could not apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel to grant the mother the relief she sought.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Family Court -- Subject Matter Jurisdiction -- Proceeding to Have Mother's Former Same-Sex Partner Declared Parent </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the petition of a child's birth mother pursuant to the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (Family Ct Act art 5-B [UIFSA]) which sought to have her former same-sex partner, who lacked legal ties to her and lacked biological and legal ties to the child, adjudicated a parent of the child and required to pay child support. Family Court, a court of limited subject matter jurisdiction, is only competent to entertain such applications as the Constitution or a statute specifically enumerates. UIFSA authorizes a proceeding for a determination of &quot;parentage&quot; (Family Ct Act &sect; 580-301 [b] [6]; &sect; 580-701), and provides that in deciding such a proceeding, the Family Court is required to apply the procedural and substantive law generally applicable to a &quot;similar&quot; proceeding originating in this state, and may only exercise whatever &quot;powers&quot; and provide whatever &quot;remedies&quot; that are &quot;available&quot; in such a proceeding (Family Ct Act &sect; 580-303 [1]). The only proceeding in this state similar to a proceeding for a determination of parentage is a paternity proceeding pursuant to Family Court Act article 5, which only provides a vehicle for resolving controversies concerning a male's fatherhood of a child. Further, although the doctrine of equitable estoppel can be applied in a proceeding pursuant to Family Court Act article 5, Family Court lacks the power to grant equitable relief; its application of the doctrine in article 5 proceedings is merely to preclude a party from denying a certain fact because of equitable considerations. Here, petitioner demanded certain relief the Family Court was not specifically authorized by the Constitution or statute to grant, and Family Court could not apply the doctrine. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner owners of impacted property brought a proceeding pursuant to EDPL 207, seeking review of a determination of respondent New York State Urban Development Corporation, d/b/a Empire State Development Corporation (ESDC), which authorized the condemnation of real property. The owners asserted that the proposed taking of their properties violated N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 6, 7, 11, and N.Y. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ESDC initially argued that the proceeding was time barred under EDPL 207(A). However, the appellate court held that, as the owners first brought a timely federal court action, they were entitled to tolling under CPLR 205(a), and this action was timely. The federal courts' rulings did not preclude the owners' state-law claims. However, EDPL 207(C)(4) authorized the appellate court to consider whether a public use, benefit, or purpose was to have been served by the acquisition. The owners failed to show that the ESDC's determination was not rationally related to a legitimate public purpose. Over half of the project site was formally designated as blighted and in need of development more than 40 earlier. A blight study provided an adequate foundation for ESDC's conclusion that the land was substandard. The owners' argument that some of the public benefits may never actually have been realized was conclusory and speculative. Any incidental profit that may have inured to the private developer did not undercut the public purpose of the condemnation. The project's public benefits were not incidental or pretextual in comparison with benefits to particular, favored private entities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The determination was confirmed, the petition was denied, and the proceeding was dismissed on the merits.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Limitation of Actions -- Commencement of Action after Termination of Prior Action -- Judicial Review of Eminent Domain Determination </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A proceeding pursuant to EDPL 207 (A) challenging the condemnation of petitioners' properties, commenced within six months of the dismissal of petitioners' related state-law claims in a federal action, was not time-barred by the statute's 30-day time period within which to seek review of a condemnation determination. CPLR 205 (a), which provides a six-month grace period to recommence certain previously dismissed actions or proceedings, was applicable since petitioners timely asserted their state-law claims under the EDPL in the federal action, the state-law claims were dismissed by the federal court without an adjudication on the merits and the proceeding was commenced within six months after the date upon which the determination in the federal action became final. Petitioners did not forfeit their right to seek review of their state-law claims by electing to challenge the constitutionality of the condemnation in federal court rather than immediately commencing an EDPL proceeding in state court. The 30-day time period set forth in EDPL 207 (A) operates as a procedural limitation on the remedy, and not as a substantive condition precedent to judicial review which would have rendered the toll of CPLR 205 (a) inapplicable.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judgments -- Collateral Estoppel -- Judicial Review of Eminent Domain Determination -- Effect of Dismissal of State-Law Claims in Prior Federal Action </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioners were not collaterally estopped from maintaining a proceeding pursuant to EDPL 207 (A) challenging the condemnation of their properties, where their state-law claims had been raised in a federal action and dismissed without an adjudication on the merits. The only issue before the federal courts was whether petitioners were able to state a claim establishing an unconstitutional taking under the United States Constitution. The primary issue in an EDPL proceeding is whether there was a foundation in the administrative record for the determination to acquire property through condemnation. Since collateral estoppel effect will only be given to matters actually litigated and determined in a prior action, the determinations made by the federal courts did not preclude petitioners from obtaining a review of the administrative record and litigating their state-law claims, as contemplated by the condemnation review scheme.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Taking of Property -- Urban Redevelopment Project -- &quot;Public Use&quot; Requirement </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The condemnation of petitioners' homes and businesses in order to facilitate advancement of an urban redevelopment project, including the construction of a publicly-owned sports arena and the creation of new housing, in an underutilized and blighted area, did not violate the Public Use Clause of the New York Constitution (NY Const, art I, &sect; 7 [a]). The Public Use Clause, which provides that &quot;[p]rivate property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation,&quot; is not to be read restrictively to allow the State to exercise its eminent domain power only where the condemned property is to be held open for use by all members of the public. A literal interpretation of the phrase &quot;public use&quot; is inconsistent with the more expansive formulation of &quot;public use&quot; set forth in EDPL 207 (C) (4), which expressly authorizes a reviewing court to consider whether a &quot;public use, benefit or purpose will be served by the proposed acquisition.&quot; Petitioners otherwise failed to show that the challenged condemnation determination was not rationally related to a legitimate public purpose. It could not be said that the public benefits that the project was expected to yield were incidental or pretextual in comparison to the benefit that would be bestowed upon the project's private developer. Moreover, in light of evidence that much of the land to be acquired was substandard, and that the taking was rationally related to the purpose of remedying these substandard conditions, any incidental profit that might inure to the private developer from the remediation of the blighted project site would not undercut the public purpose of the condemnation of the substandard land.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Taking of Property -- Urban Redevelopment Project -- Construction of Housing Not Restricted to Persons of Low Income </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The condemnation of property in an underutilized and blighted area in order to facilitate advancement of an urban redevelopment project that would include new housing, did not contravene the Housing Article of the State Constitution (art XVIII, &sect; 6) by allowing state funds to be used for the construction of housing without restricting occupancy of the new housing units to low-income persons. Section 6 provides for both the construction of low-income housing and the clearance and rehabilitation of substandard areas. Rehabilitation of substandard land may be achieved through the exercise of eminent domain without the simultaneous construction of a public housing project restricted to low-income occupants. It is only where the power of eminent domain is to be used to implement the separate purpose of providing low-income housing that state funding must be linked to the imposition of a restriction on occupancy to low-income persons. Since the core purpose of the project was to rehabilitate substandard land through improvements, including construction of a sports arena, publicly-accessible open space and community facilities, it could not be deemed a housing project within the ambit of the constitutional provision.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Taking of Property -- Urban Redevelopment Project -- Due Process -- Equal Protection </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The condemnation of petitioners' property in order to facilitate advancement of an urban redevelopment project did not violate petitioners' due process rights. Respondent substantially complied with the necessary procedural requirements by conducting a public hearing at which those in attendance were given a reasonable opportunity to present an oral or written statement and to submit other documents concerning the proposed public project (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;EDPL 203). Although not every interested person who attended the hearing had an opportunity to speak because of the large turnout, respondent accepted written comments for more than one month after the close of the hearing, and conducted two community forums to allow area residents to express their views. Petitioners' equal protection claim similarly lacked merit in the absence of evidence that they had been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there was no rational basis for the difference in treatment. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner mother sought review of an order of the Family Court, New York County (New York), which, inter alia, denied her objection to a support magistrate's order that dismissed without prejudice the mother's petition seeking to vacate a 1992 child support agreement, to direct a new hearing, and to replace the child support agreement entered into with respondent father, whom she had never married, with a new schedule of support.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Shortly after the child's birth, the parties negotiated a child support agreement in which the father was to pay a total of $126,050 over a period of nine years to cover the child's expenses until she reached the age of 21. The agreement was submitted to the family court for approval as required by Family Ct Act &sect; 516(a). Even though the parties' financial disclosure affidavits resulted in the father's annual child support obligation under the guidelines of the Child Support Standards Act (CSSA) being calculated at $21,052, the mother waived any right to future child support under the CSSA. The examiner made a brief inquiry as to whether the parties understood their obligations under the agreement and then approved it. On appeal, the court reversed the dismissal of the mother's motion to vacate the prior order. While the father had discharged his obligations under the agreement, the examiner failed to comply with the requirements in &sect; 516(a) because an insufficient inquiry was made to protect the best interests of the child; the lump sum payment averaged out to about $6,000 a year for 21 years, and the gross disparity with the CSSA figure should have prompted further inquiry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner mother was not precluded by Family Court Act &sect; 516 from seeking to modify the terms of a completely performed 1992 negotiated child support agreement for her nonmarital child where the Hearing Examiner failed to comply with the requirements of the statute in approving the agreement without determining whether the agreement provided adequate support for the child for 21 years. The agreement required respondent father, in lieu of the support provisions required by the Child Support Standards Act (CSSA) (Family Ct Act &sect; 413), to make a lump-sum payment of $ 126,050 to be paid over a period of nine years, even though CSSA guidelines would have provided for $ 21,054 in annual basic child support, without factoring in any statutory add-ons. The gross disparity between the two figures should at least have prompted the Hearing Examiner to conduct further inquiry as to whether the agreement was in the best interests of the child. Consequently, the matter was remanded for a new hearing at which petitioner will bear the burden to establish that the 1992 support obligations no longer provide for the best interests of the child. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the County Court, Dutchess County (New York), which convicted him of vehicular assault in the second degree (two counts) under Penal Law &sect; 120.03(1) and operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (two counts) under Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192(2) and (3). A motion to suppress the results of a blood alcohol test (BAT) had previously been denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant challenged, as violative of due process, a rebuttable presumption created under &sect; 120.03(1) that proof of operation of a motor vehicle while impaired or intoxicated and proof of serious physical injury to another person gave rise to a rebuttable presumption that the serious injury was the result of such intoxication. The evidence presented at the suppression hearing indicated that defendant drove through a red light and struck a marked patrol car driven by a city police officer, who suffered head injuries as a result. While defendant was treated for possible head injuries, he allegedly gave consent at the hospital to a BAT, which revealed that his blood alcohol content was more than twice the legal limit. On appeal, the court affirmed. The rebuttable presumption in &sect; 120.03(1) was not unconstitutionally vague as it would not arise if a driver's operation of a vehicle could not be deemed a proximate cause of the accident at issue. At any rate, the People's evidence at trial, including eyewitness testimony that opposing traffic had a green light, was clearly sufficient to give rise to the rebuttable presumption.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In the prosecution of defendant for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 [2], [3]) and vehicular assault in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 120.03 [1]), the application of the rebuttable presumption in Penal Law &sect; 120.03 (1) that the serious injuries sustained by the victim were the result of defendant's intoxication did not violate defendant's due process rights. Penal Law &sect; 120.03 (1) provides that the rebuttable presumption that a defendant's intoxication caused the subject accident arises only &quot;[i]f it is established that the person operating such motor vehicle . . . caused such serious physical injury while unlawfully intoxicated or impaired by the use of alcohol or a drug.&quot; If a driver's operation of a vehicle cannot be deemed a proximate cause of the subject accident, then the rebuttable presumption would not arise, but here the evidence at trial was sufficient to give rise to the rebuttable presumption.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Vehicular Assault -- Rebuttable Presumption That Serious Injuries Were Caused by Driving while Intoxicated or Impaired</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In the prosecution of defendant for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 [2], [3]) and vehicular assault in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 120.03 [1]), the evidence at trial was sufficient to give rise to the rebuttable presumption in Penal Law &sect; 120.03 (1) that the serious injuries sustained by the victim were the result of defendant's intoxication. Defendant admitted that he had consumed a mixed alcoholic drink prior to the accident, and his blood alcohol content tested at .18% approximately two hours after the accident. Two eyewitnesses testified that defendant had a red light as he approached the intersection, and neither witness indicated that defendant slowed down as he approached the intersection. The electrician responsible for maintaining the traffic signals at the intersection testified that they were fully operational. In addition, a collision reconstructionist testified that his examination of the roadway and the two vehicles indicated that defendant did not brake prior to impact and there was no malfunction in the steering wheel or brakes of defendant's truck.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Vehicular Assault </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Not Void for Vagueness</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Penal Law &sect; 120.03 (1), which prohibits operating a vehicle in a manner that causes serious physical injury and while intoxicated and/or impaired by drugs in violation of Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 (2), (3), (4) or (4-a), is not unconstitutionally vague. The statutory language conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices. Specifically, the phrase &quot;as a result of such intoxication&quot; would be understood to mean that &quot;by virtue of&quot; or &quot;flowing from&quot; a driver's voluntary consumption of alcohol to the extent that the driver is incapable of employing the physical and mental abilities which he or she is expected to possess in order to operate a vehicle as a reasonable and prudent driver, serious physical injury occurs. Similarly, the statute provides clear guidelines to law enforcement personnel, as a person may be arrested for violating Penal Law &sect; 120.03 based upon probable cause to believe that the defendant was driving while intoxicated and in doing so, operated a vehicle in a manner that caused serious physical injury.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Vehicular Assault -- Weight of Evidence</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Defendant's conviction of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 [2], [3]) and vehicular assault in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 120.03 [1]) was not against the weight of the evidence. Defendant admitted that he had consumed a mixed alcoholic drink prior to the accident, and his blood alcohol content tested at .18% approximately two hours after the accident. Two eyewitnesses testified that defendant had a red light as he approached the intersection, and neither witness indicated that defendant slowed down as he approached the intersection. The electrician responsible for maintaining the traffic signals at the intersection testified that they were fully operational. In addition, a collision reconstructionist testified that his examination of the roadway and the two vehicles indicated that defendant did not brake prior to impact and there was no malfunction in the steering wheel or brakes of defendant's truck. The jury verdict demonstrated that the jury credited the testimony of the eyewitnesses regarding the red light, which, coupled with the electrician's testimony, supported the jury's implicit finding that the defendant disregarded a red light. Accordingly, defendant failed to rebut the presumption that his act of driving while intoxicated caused the accident.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Vehicular Assault -- Failure of Victim to Wear Seatbelt</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In the prosecution of defendant for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 [2], [3]) and vehicular assault in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 120.03 [1]), it was not error to bar defendant from contending that the failure of his victim, an on-duty police officer, to wear a seat belt was an intervening cause of the victim's serious physical injuries. Defendant's contention on that point was speculative, as he had no expert witness available who could quantify or specify which of the victim's injuries would have been mitigated had he worn his seat belt. In any event, the victim, as an operator of an authorized emergency vehicle, was exempt from the requirement that he wear a seat belt (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect;&sect; 101, 1229-c [3], [4]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor Vehicles -- Chemical Tests -- Voluntary Consent to Blood Draw</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In the prosecution of defendant for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 [2], [3]) and vehicular assault in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 120.03 [1]), the suppression court properly determined that defendant voluntarily consented to the blood draw for testing his blood alcohol content. The arresting officer had probable cause to arrest the defendant for driving while intoxicated based on the totality of the circumstances, which included the information communicated to the arresting officer by the officer who had been on the accident scene and had spoken with the defendant, the arresting officer's own observations at the hospital of defendant's bloodshot and glassy eyes and detection of alcohol on defendant's breath, and the results of the Alco-Sensor test that showed alcohol in the defendant's system. Moreover, although defendant sustained a head wound during the accident, the evidence demonstrated that defendant was conscious, coherent and capable of exercising his rights. There was no evidence that the arresting officer, in obtaining defendant's consent, engaged in coercion, illegality or deception. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In an action involving a decision by defendant, the Department of Civil Service, to recognize the parties to a same-sex marriage as spouses under certain circumstances, plaintiff taxpayers sought review of an order of the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), which, among other things, granted summary judgment in favor of the Department and other defendants and dismissed the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Department's policy, which recognized same-sex couples as spouses if their marriage was valid in the jurisdiction where it was solemnized, allowed such spouses of state employees access to the benefits provided under the state health insurance program provided by Civil Service Law &sect;&sect; 161(1), 164(1). The taxpayers sought a declaration that the Department's policy was illegal, unconstitutional, and resulted in the unlawful disbursement of public funds. The court affirmed. An out-of-state same-sex marriage could be recognized under the marriage recognition rule because while provisions of the Domestic Relations Law limited marriages solemnized in New York to opposite-sex couples, those statutes had not been read by the state's highest court as invalidating same-sex marriages solemnized in other jurisdictions. Same-sex marriage was not abhorrent to public policy as New York had not enacted legislation to deny full faith and credit to out-of-state same-sex marriages as permitted under the Defense of Marriage Act, 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1738C. Once such a marriage was recognized in New York, each party would be a party to a marriage and thus a legal spouse under Civil Service Law art. 11.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The marriage recognition rule, which recognizes as valid a marriage considered valid in the place where celebrated, was applicable in an action seeking a declaration regarding the legality of the New York State Department of Civil Service's recognition of the parties to a valid out-of-state same-sex marriage as spouses for the purpose of allowing such spouses of state employees access to health insurance benefits, and warranted dismissal of the cause of action alleging that the recognition of such marriages was an unlawful disbursement of public funds. No New York statute expressly precludes recognition of a same-sex marriage solemnized elsewhere, and although the Court of Appeals has held that the Domestic Relations Law limits marriages solemnized in New York to opposite-sex couples (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hernandez v Robles</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 7 NY3d 338, 357, 855 NE2d 1, 821 NYS2d 770 [2006]), it did not hold that same-sex marriages solemnized elsewhere would not be defined as marriages in New York. Nor does New York public policy abhor the recognition of out-of-state same-sex marriages.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The parties to a valid out-of-state same-sex marriage are spouses as defined under Civil Service Law article XI for the purpose of allowing such spouses of state employees access to the benefits provided under the New York State Health Insurance Program (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Civil Service Law &sect; 161 [1]; &sect; 164 [1]).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In recognizing the parties to a valid out-of-state same-sex marriage as spouses for the purpose of allowing such spouses of state employees access to health insurance benefits, the New York State Department of Civil Service did not usurp the Legislature's authority in violation of the separation of powers doctrine. The Department's recognition of same-sex spouses fell squarely within the scope of the policy expressed in Civil Service Law &sect;&sect; 161 and 164 to provide benefits to the spouses and dependent children of state employees. Moreover, in recognizing those marriages, the Department has not usurped the Legislature's power to subsequently determine by positive legislation that out-of-state same-sex marriages cannot be recognized in New York.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Gift of Public Funds -- Recognition by Department of Civil Service of Valid Out-of-State Same-Sex Marriage for Purposes of Spousal Health Care Benefits </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The policy of the New York State Department of Civil Service in recognizing the parties to a valid out-of-state same-sex marriage as spouses for the purpose of allowing such spouses of state employees access to health insurance benefits did not constitute the use of public funds to promote a private undertaking, the personal goal of a former Governor to create civil marriage equality in New York, in violation of NY Constitution, article VII, &sect; 8 (1). Rather, the policy furthered a valid governmental purpose to benefit public employees.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The determination of the New York State Department of Civil Service to recognize the parties to a valid out-of-state same-sex marriage as spouses for the purpose of allowing such spouses of state employees access to health insurance benefits was not invalid for the Department's failure to comply with the formal rulemaking procedures of the State Administrative Procedure Act, as the determination was an interpretative statement that was merely explanatory (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;State Administrative Procedure Act &sect; 102 [2] [b] [iv]). The Department's expansion of the definition of the term &quot;spouse&quot; was a reasonable interpretation of existing Department regulations that define the term &quot;dependent&quot; as &quot;includ[ing] the spouse of an employee or retired employee&quot; (4 NYCRR 73.1 [h]). </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner retirement community operator appealed an order of the Supreme Court, Nassau County (New York), which declared Suffolk County, N.Y., Loc. Law No. 1534 (2006), valid in all respects. The operator had brought a proceeding pursuant to CPLR art. 78 to enjoin respondent county from enforcing Local Law No. 1534, and it sought a declaration that it was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The retirement community consisted of homes owned by individuals who were age 55 and over, but situated on land leased from the operator.  Additionally, each resident had executed a residency agreement that required payment of a charge that was, in effect, a monthly land lease payment. At a public hearing, some residents complained that the common areas were in a state of disrepair and that the monthly charges were disparate and unreasonably raised when a home was sold. As a result of the hearing, Local Law No. 1534 was passed. The trial court determined that Local Law No. 1534 was valid. On appeal, the court found that as there was a rational basis for it, Local Law No. 1534 was not violative of the Equal Protection Clause. Further, there was no federal or state preemption. However, it found that several portions of Local Law No. 1534 should have been declared invalid because the county legislature lacked the constitutional or statutory power to enact those portions pursuant to NY Const. art IX, &sect; 2(c)(ii)(10) and Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 10(1)(a). Such provisions interfered with the operator's right of enjoyment of its property and were unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local Laws--Validity--Regulation of Planned Retirement Communities.--Local Law enacted in response to certain policies of petitioner's planned retirement community, which sought to comprehensively regulate operations of such communities by extending protections to residents of those communities, did not violate Equal Protection Clause; even though petitioner's development was only one of its kind in County, Local Law did not intentionally treat petitioner differently than others similarly situated; Local Law regulates planned retirement communities, and County Legislature adopted Local Law with view that as population of County aged, it was anticipated that additional planned retirement communities would be established in County; thus, County Legislature had rational basis for adopting Local Law--Local Law was not preempted by state or federal legislation--however, several portions of Local Law should have been declared invalid, as County Legislature did not have constitutional or statutory power to enact those portions of Local Law. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">General Municipal Law &sect; 33(2) and Education Law &sect; 2854(1)(c) directed the Comptroller to audit each charter school in New York State. The appellate court noted that it was undisputed that public school districts were subject to audit by the Comptroller, since they were considered political subdivisions of the State. Charter schools, while operating independently of existing school districts, retained many of the quintessential characteristics of public school districts and were part of the State's public school system. The significant public funding they received was linked to and had an impact upon public school districts. In light of the legislature's broad delegatory authority regarding the Comptroller, and the enormous public funding involved which implicated the Comptroller's fundamental duty under N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 1 to supervise state fiscal matters, as well as the strong presumption of the constitutionality of statutes, the appellate court held that General Municipal Law &sect; 33(2) and Education Law &sect; 2854(1)(c) did not violate N.Y.

Audits of charter schools are &quot;incidental&quot; to the Comptroller's authority to supervise the accounts of public school districts, and thus do not violate NY Constitution, art V, &sect; 1. That provision, in setting forth the Comptroller's broad responsibility to supervise state fiscal matters, expressly limits the Legislature's power to assign to the Comptroller any administrative duties except as may be &quot;incidental&quot; to the performance of the Comptroller's constitutionally authorized functions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Pursuant to CPLR art. 78, petitioners, an attorney and 10 nurses from the Philippines, sought a writ of prohibition against respondent district attorney to prohibit the district attorney from prosecuting them under an indictment and to prohibit respondent judge from presiding over the criminal matter. Petitioners were charged with conspiracy and endangering the welfare of a child and of a physically-disabled person.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioners' prosecution arose from the nurses simultaneously resigning from their jobs at a nursing home after their shifts ended as a result of failing to receive the pay they were promised and for other conditions of their employment that were not met. The indictment centered around the allegations that the attorney advised them to resign and that such resignations endangered the welfare of the patients at the nursing home, who were disabled children. Petitioners asserted that the prosecution violated their right against involuntary servitude as well as violated the attorney's First Amendment rights to advise his clients. The court agreed with petitioners and determined that the indictment explicitly made the nurses' conduct in resigning a component of each of the crimes charged, which impermissibly placed them in the position of being required to remain in the nursing home's employment, or be subject to criminal sanction. Furthermore, the prosecution impermissibly violated the attorney's constitutionally protect rights of expression and association in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments since he had a constitutional right to provide legal advice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A proceeding for a writ of prohibition was an appropriate vehicle in which to raise a challenge to the constitutionality of a pending criminal proceeding against petitioners, nurses indicted for various crimes in connection with their simultaneous resignations from positions at a nursing home and the attorney who provided them with legal advice. Although not all constitutional claims are cognizable by way of prohibition, the presentation of an arguable and substantial claim which implicates a fundamental constitutional right generally results in the availability of a proceeding in the nature of prohibition. Here, petitioners claimed that the prosecution contravened the Thirteenth Amendment proscription against involuntary servitude by seeking to impose criminal sanctions upon the nurses for resigning their positions, and attempting to punish their attorney for exercising his First Amendment right of free speech in providing them with legal advice. If the prosecution impermissibly infringed upon those constitutional rights, the act of prosecuting the petitioners would be an act in excess in power, rather than a mere error of law, and prohibition would be an available remedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Proceeding against Body or Officer -- Prohibition - When Remedy Available--Challenge to Constitutionality of Pending Criminal Proceeding -- Prosecution of Nurses Who Resigned</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner nurses were entitled to a writ of prohibition barring their prosecution on charges of conspiracy in the sixth degree, endangering the welfare of a child and endangering the welfare of a physically-disabled person in connection with their simultaneous resignations from their positions at a nursing home. Although the Penal Law provisions relating to endangerment of children and the physically disabled do not on their face infringe upon the Thirteenth Amendment right to be free from involuntary service by making the failure to perform labor or services an element of a crime, the indictment handed down against petitioners explicitly made their conduct in resigning their positions a component of each of the crimes charged. The prosecution had the practical effect of exposing petitioners to criminal penalty for exercising their right to leave their employment at will, and the imposition of such a limitation upon their ability to freely exercise their right to resign from the service of an employer who allegedly failed to fulfill the promises and commitments made to them was the antithesis of the free and voluntary system of labor envisioned by the framers of the Thirteenth Amendment. Although an employee's abandonment of his or her post in an &quot;extreme case&quot; may constitute an exceptional circumstance which warrants infringement upon the right to freely leave employment, respondent proffered no reason why this was an extreme case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petitioner attorney was entitled to a writ of prohibition barring his prosecution on charges of conspiracy in the sixth degree, endangering the welfare of a child, endangering the welfare of a physically-disabled person and criminal solicitation in the fifth degree in connection with his representation of 10 nurses who simultaneously resigned from their positions at a nursing home. The prosecution impermissibly violated petitioner's constitutionally protected rights of expression and association in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The indictment asserted that petitioner committed the charged offenses by counseling the nurses to resign immediately, and by filing a discrimination claim on their behalf, and it affirmatively sought to punish petitioner for providing legal advice given in good faith. Petitioner did not advise the nurses to commit a crime, as the nurses' conduct in resigning could not, under the circumstances of the case, subject them to criminal prosecution. Regardless of whether petitioner's legal assessment was accurate, it was objectively reasonable, and an attorney who advises a client to take an action that he or she, in good faith, believes to be legal does not lose the protection of the First Amendment if his or her advice is later determined to be incorrect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendants were convicted in the County Court of Schoharie County, New York, of falsifying business records in the first degree (Penal Law &sect; 175.10), petit larceny, theft of services (Penal Law &sect; 165.15(6)), and criminal tampering in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 145.15)). They appealed. The State conceded on appeal that the evidence had been insufficient to convict defendant two.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">An electric company employee found jumper cables at a meter box at defendants' home that caused 10 percent of the current to bypass the meter. Defendant one testified he had no knowledge of the cables. The appellate court held that evidence that the meter had been altered by the cables; that defendant one had the skills, tools, materials, and opportunity to open the meter box without disturbing its seal and place the cables within; and that the cables allowed him use some electricity--&quot;property&quot; under Penal Law &sect; 155.00(1)--without its being recorded, supported his larceny conviction. There was sufficient evidence that the cables were placed in the box without the company's consent to support defendant one's conviction of second degree criminal tampering. As the meter recorded the amount of electricity used, the meter itself contained the &quot;business record&quot; at issue as defined by Penal Law &sect; 175.00(2), satisfying that element of the crime of falsifying business records. The theft of services statute allowed the jury to presume that the person receiving the services did the tampering with the intent to avoid payment for the services, and those presumptions were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Larceny.--In prosecution in which it was alleged that jumper cables had diverted some of electricity around meter at defendant's home, jury could rationally conclude that defendant placed jumper cables; there was evidence that electric meter had been altered by placement of jumper cables, and that defendant had skills, tools, materials, opportunity and motive to open meter box without disturbing its seal and place cables within; there was also evidence that jumper cables allowed defendant to use 10% of electricity without it being recorded by meter--from this evidence and fact that &quot;property&quot; is defined as including electricity (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 155.00 [1]), jury could readily infer that defendant tampered with electric meter and took property to which he was not entitled with requisite intent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Criminal Tampering.--In prosecution in which it was alleged that jumper cables placed by defendant had diverted some of electricity around meter at his home, conviction of criminal tampering (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 145.15) was supported by evidence; security investigator for electric power company testified that jumper cables did not belong in meter box and that he turned over investigation of matter to police; it could be inferred from this testimony that defendant had no right to tamper with company's equipment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Falsifying Business Records.--In prosecution in which it was alleged that jumper cables placed by defendant had diverted some of electricity around meter at his home, conviction of falsifying business records was supported by evidence; business records are defined as &quot;any writing or article, including computer data or a computer program, kept or maintained by an enterprise for the purpose of evidencing or reflecting its condition or activity&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 175.00 [2]); evidence showed that meter itself recorded amount of electricity used and that presence of jumper cables caused it to record 10% less electricity than actually consumed; thus, meter itself contained business record. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Theft of Services.--In prosecution in which it was alleged that jumper cables placed by defendant had diverted some of electricity around meter at his home, application of presumptions contained in statute defining crime of theft of services (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 165.15 [6]) did not violate defendant's due process rights; presumptions that person receiving service did tampering and that his or her intent was to avoid payment for that service are not unconstitutional; defendant cited no unique circumstance that would break obvious connection between his use of electricity and inference that he intentionally caused diversion. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Gang Assault.--In prosecution of defendant for gang assault in first degree (Penal Law &sect;120.07), contention that Penal Law &sect;120.07 is unconstitutional lacked merit; phrase &quot;aided by two or more persons actually present&quot; contained in statute has plain meaning that excludes constructive presence, and statute was not vague as applied to defendant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Corroboration of Accomplice Testimony.--In prosecution for gang assault, testimony of defendant's accomplices was adequately corroborated (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 60.22 [1]) by evidence that defendant and his accomplices sought confrontation, that defendant was wounded when he returned from scene of assault and that defendant's blood was found at scene of assault. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted of assault in the second degree. She appealed, contending that the Supreme Court, Bronx County, New York, erred in permitting the complainant to give televised testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The complainant accused defendant of hitting him with a hammer and stealing his money. The trial court held that the State established by clear and convincing evidence that the elderly complainant was unable to travel from his home in California to New York without seriously endangering his health. It found him unavailable to testify and permitted the People to present his testimony by a live, two-way television conference. Defendant argued that the use of televised testimony violated her Sixth Amendment right of confrontation and was not statutorily authorized. The appellate court agreed with the latter contention and did not reach the constitutional issue. Defendant's objection to the procedure, and the trial court's ruling thereon, preserved the issue for review. CPL art. 65 authorized trial courts to admit televised testimony only by child witnesses in certain sex crime cases and under carefully specified circumstances. The trial court did not have the authority under Judiciary Law &sect; 2-b(3) to in effect revise art. 65 by expanding its scope. Separation of powers principles precluded trial courts from allowing televised testimony in circumstances not authorized by art. 65.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Witnesses -- Unauthorized Admission of Witness's Televised Testimony</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was entitled to a new trial due to the unauthorized admission at trial of the complainant's live, two-way televised testimony from outside the state. It was error to allow the televised testimony based on the finding that the People established by clear and convincing evidence that complainant was unable to travel to New York without seriously endangering his health and was thus unavailable to testify. In the absence of any express legislative authorization, the court lacked the inherent authority pursuant to Judiciary Law &sect; 2-b (3) to permit the televised testimony. The statute limits the authority of the court to adopt &quot;new process and forms of proceedings&quot; to those that are &quot;necessary to carry into effect the powers and jurisdiction possessed by it,&quot; and is only concerned with the authority of courts over matters of procedure. The receipt of the televised testimony of an absent witness in a criminal case necessarily requires a substantive policy decision that must be legislative in nature. The expanded use of televised testimony in this case was inconsistent with the comprehensive legislative scheme contained in CPL article 65 authorizing the televised testimony of a witness only in certain sex crime cases and only with respect to certain child witnesses. It could be inferred that the expression of authority to permit televised testimony under specific limited circumstances indicated an exclusion of authority under other circumstances. Consequently, even if admission of the televised testimony of defendant's principal accuser did not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment right of confrontation, the receipt of such testimony denied her a valuable component of that right and tainted the fairness of the trial.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Preservation of Issue for Review -- Unauthorized Admission of Witness's Televised Testimony</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant was entitled to a new trial due to the unauthorized admission at trial of the complainant's live, two-way televised testimony from out of state. The question of the authority of the trial court to admit the televised testimony was preserved for appellate review by defendant's timely and specific protest that the procedure sought by the People to obtain the witness's testimony at trial was not authorized, as well as by the motion court's express ruling on that protest that the inherent power of the courts pursuant to Judiciary Law &sect; 2-b (3) was sufficient to authorize it (CPL 470.05 [2]). Even though defendant did not specifically address the issue of the trial court's lack of authority on appeal, the issue presented a pure question of law that would merit review by the Court of Appeals. In any event, even if defendant's Sixth Amendment right of confrontation was not violated, she was denied a valuable component of that right. In the absence of express legislative authorization, depriving defendant of a face-to-face meeting with her principal accuser tainted the fairness of the trial. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff owner sued defendant city, seeking a judgment declaring Kingston, N.Y., Code ch. 332 unconstitutional under the New York and United States Constitutions, an injunction preventing enforcement of the law, and judgment for damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The Supreme Court, Ulster County (New York), denied the owner's motion and granted the city's cross motion for summary judgment, dismissing the complaint. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The owner argued that Kingston, N.Y., Code ch. 332 was unconstitutional because it did not require a warrant if the property owner did not consent to an inspection and because he was penalized for trying to exercise his right to refuse to consent to an inspection. The appellate court disagreed. As the plain language of Kingston, N.Y., Code ch. 332 required either the consent of the owner or a valid search warrant in order for the Building Safety Division to inspect property, it was facially constitutional. Nor was there any evidence that a refusal to consent to an inspection was considered a violation of the ordinance. Similarly, the evidence proffered by the owner did not establish the application of criminal sanctions on the basis of a refusal to consent to an inspection, as opposed to a failure to keep or cancel a scheduled inspection. Thus, on its face, the statute did not unconstitutionally penalize a property owner for refusing to consent. Since the owner's right to refuse to consent to a warrantless search was not penalized, his consent was voluntary and not vitiated under these circumstances. Further, the owner's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim for damages was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In furtherance of its interest in acquiring certain property from the United States Army pursuant to the Federal Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, the town formed a local redevelopment agency to develop a usage plan for the property. When the town chose not to purchase the property, the Army sold it to the owner. Thereafter, the town enacted the article to implement it reuse plan for the property. It created a planned residence district, which limited the number and type of homes that could be built on the property and required development of a community recreational facility. The appellate court found, inter alia, that rezoning the property to implement a specific project that the town had intended to construct if it acquired the property was not a consideration or purpose embodied in Town Law &sect;&sect; 261, 262. The article was unnecessarily and excessively restrictive. It was not enacted for legitimate zoning purposes. The district and its specific form of mixed-usage development was inconsistent with the surrounding area.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Town's enactment of a zoning ordinance in order to implement a redevelopment plan for property previously owned by the United States, which plan included a mix of single-family and senior dwellings and a community recreational facility, was ultra vires of the Town's statutory zoning authority (Town Law &sect; 261</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"> et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) and, therefore, void as a matter of law. Plaintiff purchased the property through a competitive bidding process after the Town declined to exercise its right to acquire the property and redevelop it for a public purpose. Rezoning of the property for implementation of a specific project that the Town had intended to construct if it acquired the property was not a proper consideration or purpose embodied in the enabling statutes. While those statutes empower a town to regulate and restrict lot sizes and permitted uses, they do not empower a town to create a zoning ordinance that specifies the exact number and type of dwellings allowed. Zoning ordinances may go no further than determining what may or may not be built. The fact that the ordinance herein was unnecessarily and excessively restrictive supported the conclusion that it was not enacted for legitimate zoning purposes. Moreover, the provisions of the ordinance requiring that the recreational facility be owned by a homeowners' association and that the senior citizen dwellings be cooperative units was clearly ultra vires and void. Plaintiff's knowledge of the redevelopment plan before it closed title did not preclude its challenge to the ordinance. </SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court, Albany County, New York, dismissed the complaint. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">To make phone calls, inmates had to place collect calls from a telephone system maintained by the company under its exclusive contract with DOCS. Under that contract, the company remitted over half of its revenues to DOCS, which used the commissions for programs to benefit inmates. The appellate court held the &quot;filed rate&quot; doctrine did not bar appellants' constitutional claims, as they were not challenging the reasonableness of the rate, only the commissions paid to DOCS. That the company passed on the expense of the commissions to its customers did not transform the commissions into unlawful taxes. Appellants' First Amendment rights to free speech and association were not violated, as they did not allege that the charged rates were so exorbitant as to deny them the ability to communicate with inmates by phone. As a prospective recipient of a collect call was in complete control over whether to accept the call, there was no unconstitutional taking. Appellants' equal protection claim failed because they did not demonstrate either that their fundamental rights had been infringed or that they were treated differently from any persons who were similarly situated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Respondent alleged adoptive mother sought review of an order of the Surrogate's Court, New York County (New York),  which granted petitioner alleged adoptive father's application for immediate visitation and for vacatur of a prior order, which granted the mother's application to re-adopt the minor child at issue, a Cambodian orphan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The parties were never married. Because of U.S. visa restrictions on Cambodian orphans, the parties decided that the father as a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago would legally adopt the child; the child would then be granted U.S. citizenship because the father was a U.S. citizen as well. The father was granted final approval of the adoption by the Cambodian government in 2004, and an amended birth certificate was issued. However, when Trinidad denied the father's application to re-adopt the child, the mother sought to adopt the child herself. After the father relinquished the permission granted to adopt the child, the Cambodian government granted the mother's request to adopt the child. The surrogate's court had granted a re-adoption but vacated the order because the mother failed to reveal that the father was listed on the child's birth certificate. On appeal, the court affirmed. The act of state doctrine did not apply because the case involved an adoption proceeding in the U.S., a matter of private as opposed to public interests, and a letter and a document from the Cambodian government claiming that the father's adoption was invalid did not constitute acts of state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the order of the surrogate's court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">International Law -- Act of State Doctrine -- Application of Doctrine to Foreign Adoption </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The act of state doctrine, which generally requires American courts to recognize the validity of acts of foreign sovereigns taken within their own jurisdictions and applicable there, did not apply in a proceeding seeking vacatur of an order of the Surrogate's Court granting respondent's application to readopt a Cambodian orphan, in which the parties invoked the jurisdiction of the New York courts and all of the parties including the child were New York domiciliaries. In an effort to circumvent United States visa restrictions on Cambodian orphans, the parties had agreed to have petitioner legally adopt the child and become his sole legal parent so that the child would be granted United States citizenship by virtue of petitioner's status as a United States citizen. However, the parties then brought the child to New York on a temporary medical visa where he has since resided without legal immigration status. Two documents from Cambodian governmental entities obtained ex parte by respondent, stating that she had been legally granted permission to adopt the child and that Cambodia's prior approval of petitioner's request to adopt the child was considered &quot;null and void,&quot; involved an attempt to influence the outcome of the litigation between the parties and did not constitute &quot;acts of state&quot; within the meaning of the doctrine. Moreover, the doctrine's territorial limitation precluded its application to the subject documents. Application of the doctrine to this foreign adoption would improperly allow a foreign sovereign to dictate parental rights and the legal status of New York domiciliaries. </SPAN></P>

A grand jury indictment was obtained during the four-day adjournment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court was not required to address defendant's request to proceed pro se when it was first made because the request was made in the context of dissatisfaction with defense counsel based on his trial tactics and was not unequivocal. The adjournment of the preliminary hearing was appropriate as defendant had no constitutional or statutory right to such a hearing. Defendant was not denied the opportunity to testify before the grand jury as he received notice of the time and place of the grand jury presentation under CPL 190.50(5)(b) but declined the offer to testify.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioners, current and former justices, filed a mandamus petition against respondents, New York State and various state officials. The Supreme Court, Albany County, New York, dismissed all claims against the state officials, and all other claims except the allegations that the failure to increase judicial compensation violated the New York Constitution's Compensation Clause and separation of powers principles. All parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The justices' salaries had not been increased in nine years. They sought to compel disbursement of appropriated funds and an adjustment of their salaries for inflation. They argued that the system of setting their salaries violated the New York Compensation Clause, N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 25(a), and separation of powers principles, and denied them equal protection. The appellate court held that although it was an interested party to the dispute, as no other body could decide the issue, it had to hear the appeals under the Rule of Necessity. The effect of inflation was not a sufficient basis for a claim for an increase in salaries under the Compensation Clause. As the justices did not allege mass resignations by judges, or a plan by the other branches to attack the independence of the judiciary, they failed to state a separation of powers claim. As they did not allege they were selectively treated compared with others who were similarly situated, their equal protection claim failed. As N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 7 required payment within two years after passage of an appropriation act, and over two years had passed, mandamus was not available to compel payment of appropriated funds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">To the extent the trial court denied respondents' motion to dismiss the justices' claims based on the Compensation Clause and separation of powers principles, it was reversed.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Justiciable Questions -- Constitutional Challenge to Legislature's Failure to Increase Judicial Compensation -- Rule of Necessity</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 brought by current and former justices of various courts of the Unified Court System challenging the constitutionality of the Legislature's failure to have increased judicial compensation since January 1, 1999 presented a justiciable controversy as to whether the legislative and executive branches complied with constitutional limitations placed on their authority that was not precluded by separation of powers principles. Although the State Constitution grants the Legislature and Governor the power to establish judicial compensation (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 25 [a]), and expressly grants budgetary and appropriation powers to the legislative and executive branches (NY Const, art VII, &sect; 7), the judicial branch retains the inherent power to protect itself from the impairment of its ability to function as an independent, coequal branch of government. In addition, although the Justices hearing the appeal had an interest in the outcome of the case, the rule of necessity required consideration of the constitutional challenges raised.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Judicial Salaries -- Constitutionality of Legislature's Failure to Increase Judicial Salaries under Compensation Clause of NY Constitution</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The failure of the Legislature to have provided the Judiciary with a salary increase since January 1, 1999 to offset the effects of inflation was not violative of that portion of the Compensation Clause of the State Constitution providing that the &quot;compensation of a judge ... shall not be diminished during [his or her] term of office&quot; (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 25 [a]). The New York Compensation Clause, like its federal counterpart (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;US Const, art III, &sect; 1), was intended to protect the independence of the Judiciary, consistent with the doctrine of separation of powers, by prohibiting diminution of judicial compensation while permitting the legislative body to increase judicial salaries as circumstances warranted. The Compensation Clause does not guarantee a real income level or require cost of living adjustments to offset inflation. Rather, the Compensation Clause leaves the power to increase judicial salaries to the discretion of the political branches, as constrained by separation of powers principles which mandate only that the legislative and executive branches refrain from hindering the independence and proper functioning of the judicial branch. Petitioners failed to allege sufficient facts to state a valid claim of a discriminatory attack on the judicial branch that had impaired or imminently threatened the Judiciary's independence and ability to function.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Judicial Salaries -- Constitutionality of Legislature's Failure to Increase Judicial Salaries under Separation of Powers Doctrine</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The failure of the Legislature to have provided the Judiciary with a salary increase since January 1, 1999 to offset the effects of inflation was not unconstitutional under the separation of powers doctrine. The Compensation Clause of the State Constitution (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 25 [a]) leaves the power to increase judicial salaries to the discretion of the political branches, as constrained by separation of powers principles which mandate only that the legislative and executive branches refrain from hindering the independence and proper functioning of the judicial branch. A constitutional violation would arise out of legislative failure to raise judicial salaries only if there was proof of a discriminatory attack on the Judiciary that had impaired or imminently threatened the independence of the Judiciary and the proper functioning of the judicial system. Here, petitioners' allegation that a number of judges had resigned or intended to do so for financial reasons and petitioners' speculative claim that the Legislature failed to act on the issue of judicial pay raises in retaliation for certain court decisions were insufficient to state a cause of action based upon a separation of powers violation. Petitioners' claim that the failure to enact a salary increase was designed to influence the Judiciary was undercut by the fact that legislators and senior executive branch officials had also been denied pay raises and by petitioners' assertions that respondents acted unconstitutionally in linking judicial pay raises to legislative and executive pay raises, along with other matters unrelated to judicial compensation. Moreover, the Speech or Debate Clause (NY Const, art III, &sect; 11) would bar inquiry into the motives of the Governor or members of the Legislature in failing to take action on judicial pay raises.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Judicial Salaries -- Constitutionality of Legislature's Failure to Increase Judicial Salaries under Equal Protection Analysis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The failure of the Legislature to have provided the Judiciary with a salary increase since January 1, 1999 to offset the effects of inflation did not violate petitioners' equal protection rights by placing them in the same class as legislators in terms of salary increases, thereby rendering the Judiciary a &quot;suspect class,&quot; and denying petitioners their claimed right contained in the Compensation Clause of the State Constitution (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 25 [a]) to maintain the integrity of their salary and compensation. Petitioners failed to state an equal protection claim in the absence of any allegation that they were selectively treated compared with others who were similarly situated. Furthermore, as constitutional officers granted unique salary protection under the Compensation Clause, judges do not bear any of the traditional indicia of a &quot;suspect class&quot; as to warrant extraordinary protection. Thus, a rational basis standard of review would apply to petitioners' equal protection claim, and petitioners failed to negate every conceivable rational basis for the Legislature's inaction in amending article 7-B of the Judiciary Law.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Proceeding against Body or Officer -- Mandamus -- Disbursement of State Funds Appropriated for Judicial Pay Raises</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In a proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 brought by current and former justices of various courts of the Unified Court System seeking a declaration that the State Legislature unconstitutionally deprived the Judiciary of a salary increase since 1999 and seeking to require respondents to maintain judicial salaries apace with inflation, mandamus did not lie to compel the State Comptroller to release funds appropriated in the 2006-2007 state budget &quot;to fund adjustments in the compensation of state-paid judges and justices of the unified court system&quot; in anticipation of the passage of a subsequent chapter law adjusting judicial salaries that was never enacted. Since more than two years had passed from the passage of the appropriation bill, mandamus was not an available avenue of relief to obtain funds from the state treasury (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NY Const, art VII, &sect; 7). In any event, the appropriation bill did not satisfy the constitutional requirement that judicial compensation be &quot;established by law&quot; (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 25 [a]) so as to provide a basis for the relief sought by petitioners. Rather, the &quot;dry appropriation&quot; merely reflected the legislative intent that funds be made available for an event that did not occur, and did not by implication effectively amend Judiciary Law article 7-B to provide pay raises for the Judiciary. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs, a father and his son, appealed the judgment of the Supreme Court, Monroe County (New York), which denied their motion for a judgment declaring that a curfew ordinance was unconstitutional. Plaintiffs brought suit against defendants, a city, its mayor, and its police chief, seeking the declaration. Plaintiffs also sought to enjoin defendants from enforcing the ordinance. The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The curfew ordinance provided that during designated hours, it was unlawful for a minor to be in a public place unless the minor could prove that one of the six enumerated exceptions set forth in the ordinance applied. Plaintiffs alleged that the ordinance was inconsistent with several state statutes and violated a number of rights guaranteed to plaintiffs under the New York and United States Constitutions. The court agreed and held that the ordinance was inconsistent with State law insofar as it applied to minors under the age of 16 and imposed an unconstitutional restriction upon the rights of parents and minors. The court found that, insofar as the ordinance provided that a minor under the age of 16 who violated the curfew ordinance committed a violation, the ordinance was inconsistent with Penal Law &sect; 30.00. The court further held that the ordinance violated the equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. 14, &sect; 1 and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, since the city failed to show a substantial relationship between the burdens imposed on juveniles by the curfew and the achievement of its objectives. The ordinance also violated free speech protections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the judgment. As such, the court denied defendants' motion to dismiss, reinstated the complaint, and granted plaintiffs' motion for a judgment declaring the ordinance unconstitutional.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Ordinance -- Juvenile Curfew Ordinance</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A city ordinance establishing a nighttime curfew for juveniles under the age of 17 years during certain designated hours in public places unless one of six enumerated exceptions applied, enacted in response to the violent deaths of three minors over a four-year period, was unconstitutional as inconsistent with the general laws of the state and with the State and Federal Constitutions. The ordinance was inconsistent with Family Court Act &sect; 305.2 and Penal Law &sect; 30.00 to the extent that it authorized police officers to detain and take juveniles under the age of 16 into custody for a curfew violation that did not constitute a crime. In addition, the ordinance was violative of equal protection under a strict scrutiny standard of review with respect to juveniles between the ages of 16 and 17 years old by unconstitutionally infringing upon those juveniles' right of free movement. Although a heightened level of scrutiny was appropriate in view of the fundamental nature of the right of free movement, the ordinance could not withstand even intermediate scrutiny. The City failed to demonstrate a substantial relationship between the burdens imposed on juveniles by the curfew and the achievement of the City's otherwise legitimate objectives of reducing youth victimization and crime. Furthermore, the ordinance imposed an unconstitutional burden on the First Amendment rights of juveniles, and violated the fundamental substantive due process rights of parents to direct and control the upbringing of their children without undue governmental interference. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Family Court, New York County (New York), entered orders which adjudicated appellants, juveniles, delinquent, upon determinations that they each committed an act which, if committed by an adult, would have constituted second degree criminal possession of a weapon and that they each committed the act of unlawful possession of a weapon by a person under 16. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Police found a gun in a charter bus which had been occupied by the three appellants. Although earlier in the day, the bus was used on a commuter route, after the route was completed, the bus was taken from the bus company yard by the driver to take the bus company's dispatcher home. The driver and the dispatcher then traveled around, picking up members of the dispatcher's family. Eventually the bus was driven to the scene of a shooting and then to a hospital. The appellate court found that the Penal Law &sect; 265.15(3) statutory presumption of possession was properly applied by the trial court. Although the bus was a &quot;public omnibus&quot; when it ran its route earlier, it was no longer being used as such when the gun was found. The absence of a definition of &quot;public omnibus&quot; in the Penal Law did not render &sect; 265.15 impermissibly vague, since the term was given its legal meaning as defined in New York jurisprudence. The statute was sufficiently clear to apprise a person of ordinary intelligence of the sort of conduct prohibited. The application of this permissive presumption was constitutional because there was a rational connection between the facts proved and the ultimate fact presumed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The statutory presumption of constructive possession of a firearm by the occupants of an automobile (Penal Law &sect; 265.15 [3]) was properly appL Edin a juvenile delinquency proceeding to establish weapon possession charges against three respondents, who were riding on a charter bus that was being used by two bus company employees, without authorization, to transport a group of their family and acquaintances to a private rendevous where a shootout occurred. The statute's &quot;public omnibus&quot; exclusion applies only to buses that are being used to transport passengers for hire. Consequently, the automobile presumption applied because the charter bus was no longer being used as a &quot;public omnibus&quot; when the loaded weapon was found on the floor of the bus. Furthermore, the absence of a definition of the term &quot;public omnibus&quot; in the Penal Law does not render the statute unconstitutionally vague, since the term is given its ordinary legal meaning (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect;&sect; 104, 126) so that a person of ordinary intelligence is apprised of the prohibited conduct. The evidence presented at the fact-finding hearing otherwise provided a sufficient basis for Family Court to have drawn an inference of possession in finding that each respondent was on the bus from the time it left the scene of the shooting until it arrived at the hospital where two of them were treated for gunshot wounds.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Suppression Hearing -- Reopening Hearing</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a juvenile delinquency proceeding, Family Court did not err in reopening the suppression hearing to allow a police officer to testify. In the absence of a showing of bad faith by the presentment agency or prejudice to respondent, the suppression court had discretion to reopen the suppression hearing before rendering a decision in order to allow the presentment agency to elicit additional evidence to cure a deficiency in proof.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Family Court properly denied respondent's motion to suppress his statements in a juvenile delinquency proceeding charging him with possession of a firearm. The court properly determined that despite reasonable efforts, the authorities were unable to notify a parent and acted reasonably, under all the circumstances, in interviewing respondent in the presence of a woman who identified herself as his aunt (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Family Ct Act &sect; 305.2). The evidence also supported the court's conclusion that respondent's gunshot wound and accompanying medical treatment did not undermine the voluntariness of his statement. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Police stopped the vehicle in which defendants were riding as passengers after the driver committed a traffic violation. Police recovered cocaine from the right front door pocket of the car. In asserting his standing to challenge the search of the car, defendants relied solely on Penal Law &sect; 220.25(1), which provided that, where a defendant was charged with possession solely on the basis of the statutory presumption that allowed a defendant to be convicted of possession based on his mere presence in the vehicle where the contraband was found, the defendant had automatic standing to challenge the search. However, this exception applied only where the criminal possessory charge was rooted solely in the statutory presumption. This was not the case here; thus, neither defendant had automatic standing. With respect to defendant two, the State, in proving possession, intended to rely on defendant two's statements made after his arrest. With respect to defendant one, the State intended to rely on testimony that, when officers activated the siren, defendant one looked at the police, dipped his body down so that his hands were by his feet area, and popped back up as the officers approached.</SPAN></P>

While one member who lived near the farm had standing to challenge the Board's and ESDC's SEQRA determinations, as the farm's proposed project was rationally classified as a type ch. action, the challenged determinations were exempt from review under 6 NYCRR 617.5(c)(3). Petitioners lacked common-law taxpayer standing since they were not challenging important governmental actions. But, under Public Officers Law &sect; 87 of FOIL, ESDC had to disclose portions of the finance memorandum and cost-benefit analysis that contained purely factual data regarding the farm's financial and operating history.

While the pending claims were not completely extinguished by virtue of Business Corporation Law &sect; 906(b)(3), the public policy concerns supporting the AG's authority to bring the claims no longer existed as the public interest was not involved in the NYSE as a private corporation.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In an action by the Attorney General against defendant, the former chairman and chief executive officer of the New York Stock Exchange, seeking restitution on behalf of the Exchange for alleged breaches of defendant's fiduciary duties under N-PCL 717 (a) and 720 (a) (1) for having influenced and accepted awards of excessive compensation during his tenure, Supreme Court erred in granting summary judgment to the Attorney General on liability, irrespective of whether the Attorney General's authority to prosecute the action lapsed when the Exchange became a for-profit entity. Supreme Court determined that defendant breached his fiduciary duties with respect to his participation in the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) based on its finding that the board of directors had not been &quot;fully informed&quot; about defendant's participation in that plan. However, from the deposition testimony of numerous directors and documentary evidence, a rational trier of fact could have concluded that the board was aware of the accumulated amount of defendant's SERP benefit in 2003 when it unanimously approved his 2003 employment agreement. Supreme Court further concluded with respect to defendant's participation in the Supplemental Executive Savings Plan (SESP), that &quot;an amendment to the SESP was not made&quot; as to permit pretermination payments when defendant was paid the money credited to his SESP account pursuant to his 2003 employment agreement, and that the payout of defendant's SESP money was therefore an &quot;ultra vires&quot; act by the Exchange. However, regardless of whether the 2003 employment agreement effectively amended the SESP as to defendant, the payout was not &quot;ultra vires&quot; as a matter of law, since the board was vested with &quot;absolute discretion&quot; to make modifications to the SESP &quot;at any time&quot; and &quot;in such manner&quot; as it deemed &quot;appropriate or desirable.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attorney General -- Powers -- Authority to Seek Restitution of Excessive Compensation from Officer or Director of Not-For-Profit Corporation Following Its Conversion into For-Profit Entity</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The Attorney General lacked legal authority under N-PCL 720 (b) to maintain an action against defendant, the former chairman and chief executive officer of the New York Stock Exchange, seeking restitution on behalf of the Exchange for alleged breaches of defendant's fiduciary duties in accepting awards of excessive compensation during his tenure since the Exchange ceased to be a not-for-profit corporation over which the Attorney General could exercise regulatory control and enforcement authority when it converted itself through a series of mergers into a for-profit company. While the conversion of the Exchange into a for-profit entity did not extinguish the claims asserted on behalf of the Exchange (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business Corporation Law &sect; 906 [b] [3]; N-PCL 908 [i] [A], [B]), the conversion divested the Attorney General of the authority or standing to prosecute them. N-PCL 720 (b) should not be construed to permit the Attorney General to continue prosecuting a cause of action seeking only monetary relief on behalf of a not-for-profit corporation after its conversion into a for-profit entity. The prosecution of such a postmerger cause of action would vindicate only the interests of private parties, not any public interest. Moreover, construing the statute to authorize the Attorney General's continued prosecution of a cause of action to redress an alleged wrong that was not perpetrated directly against the State would raise serious constitutional concerns as to whether such use of public funds falls within the constitutional prohibition against gifts of public funds to private entities (NY Const, art VII, &sect; 8 [1]), and would also implicate separation of powers issues.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In an action by the Attorney General against defendant, the former chairman and chief executive officer of the New York Stock Exchange, seeking restitution on behalf of the Exchange for alleged breaches of defendant's fiduciary duties under N-PCL 717 (a) and 720 (a) (1) for having influenced and accepted awards of excessive compensation during his tenure, defendant's motion to dismiss the Attorney General's cause of action seeking a judgment declaring that the Exchange &quot;made unlawful, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ultra vires</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> payments to [defendant]&quot; was properly denied. Because that cause of action was asserted solely against the Exchange, defendant had standing to seek its dismissal only if he would be bound, and therefore, aggrieved, by a determination underlying any judgment that the compensation was ultra vires. There was no basis for concluding that defendant would be bound by virtue of either the law of the case doctrine or collateral estoppel. Moreover, the absence of an actual controversy between the Attorney General and the Exchange was a reason to conclude that defendant would not be bound.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In an action by the Attorney General against defendant, the former chairman and chief executive officer of the New York Stock Exchange, seeking restitution on behalf of the Exchange for alleged breaches of defendant's fiduciary duties for having accepted awards of excessive compensation during his tenure, Supreme Court properly dismissed defendant's cross claims for breach of contract on the Exchange's motion for summary judgment in the absence of any evidence that defendant was actually terminated. Even if defendant was threatened with discharge, his resignation would not thereby have been rendered an involuntary act that was tantamount to a termination. In any event, defendant's failure to raise the claim that he was entitled to a payment under the Exchange's Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan even if he resigned prior to the Exchange's motion for summary judgment precluded him from raising such claim to avoid summary judgment.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. In an action by the Attorney General against defendant, the former chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of the New York Stock Exchange, seeking restitution on behalf of the Exchange for alleged breaches of defendant's fiduciary duties for having accepted awards of excessive compensation during his tenure, Supreme Court properly granted summary judgment dismissing defendant's cross claims for defamation and vindictive disparagement asserted against both the Exchange and defendant's successor as interim chair and CEO. Defendant failed to adduce evidence sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact with respect to whether the challenged statements made by his successor were made with &quot;actual malice,&quot; i.e., that when defendant's successor made the statements he entertained serious doubts as to their truth or had a high degree of awareness of their probable falsity. </SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the inmate's petition pursuant to Executive Law &sect; 259-j(3-a) upon determining that more than two years had elapsed since the inmate's release and that the release had not been revoked during that period of time. The trial court reasoned that, although Executive Law &sect; 259-j(3-a) required termination of certain sentences after two years of unrevoked &quot;parole,&quot; that section should not have been construed to grant presumptive releasees fewer rights than parolees. The appellate court held that this was error. Executive Law &sect; 259-j expressly treated parolees and presumptive releasees separately.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner had been convicted of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in 2003 and was sentenced to a two to six-year prison term. Petitioner was released from prison in 2004 after being granted presumptive release pursuant to Correction Law &sect; 806 and sought termination of his sentence in 2006; the chairman denied that request. In the instant proceeding, the trial court found that Executive Law &sect; 259-j(3-a) was applicable to periods of unrevoked presumptive release as well as unrevoked parole and granted the petition. On appeal, the court reversed. Based on the plain language of &sect; 259-j(3-a), it was applicable only to parolees and not to those, like petitioner, who had been released pursuant to other programs. The court noted that throughout Executive Law art. 12-B, the legislature consistently distinguished between the various forms of supervised release from prison; thus, its failure to refer to presumptive releasees in &sect; 259-j(3-a) indicated that the exclusion was intentional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner manufacturer brought a CPLR art. 78 proceeding against respondent commissioner, seeking review of a determination of respondent Tax Appeals Tribunal (New York) which sustained a sales and use tax assessment imposed under Tax Law arts. 28, 29.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The manufacturer built motor vehicles which it sold to dealers, who then sold the vehicles to consumers. Pursuant to the New Car Lemon Law (Lemon Law), General Business Law &sect; 198-a, the manufacturer accepted the return of 21 defective vehicles from consumers and provided comparable replacement vehicles that the manufacturer bought from franchised dealers. Because sales tax was paid on the purchase of the original vehicles and the replacement vehicles, the manufacturer sought a refund of the sales tax paid on the replacement vehicles. The appellate court found that the manufacturer was not the original vendor, that, while the property was returned and exchanged for a different vehicle, no direct exchange occurred, and that the manufacturer did not resell the replacement vehicles. The purchase of the replacement vehicles from the dealers constituted a second sale subject to sales tax under Tax Law &sect; 1105. Neither the Lemon Law nor the Tax Law entitled the manufacturer to a sales tax refund. The manufacturer did not overcome beyond a reasonable doubt the strong presumption of constitutionality attached to the sales tax laws as they related to compliance with Lemon Law obligations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner coalition appeal a judgment by the Suffolk County Supreme Court (New York) that, inter alia, dismissed its CPLR art. 78 petition to review a resolution by respondent village clerk limiting the public's access to files that were the subject of a hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After commencing a hybrid proceeding and action, the coalition attempted to serve the original petition/complaint, inter alia, upon respondent owners. When it realized that the title owners of the subject property were, in fact, the trusts, the coalition filed an amended petition/complaint naming the owners both individually and in their capacities as trustees. The appellate court found that, contrary to the coalition's contentions, it failed to meet the due diligence requirement for service of the original petition/complaint upon the owners, in their individual capacities under CPLR 308(4). Pursuant to CPLR 1001(b), the hybrid action and proceeding, with the exception of the eighth cause of action (concerning public access to the files), could not proceed in the absence of the actual title owners of the subject property. The trial court erred, however, in dismissing the eight cause of action since the owners did not have standing to seek its dismissal, since it sought declaratory relief only with respect to the village clerk. Accordingly, the coalitions' CPLR art. 78 petition should not have been dismissed in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Bronx County Supreme Court (New York) that convicted him of attempted first-degree coercion; defendant claimed that his conviction violated Apprendi and that Penal Law &sect; 135.65(1)&nbsp;unconstitutionally contained a mandatory presumption of &quot;heinousness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The appellate court found, inter alia, that defendant failed to preserve his claim that &quot;heinous quality&quot; was an element of first-degree coercion. On the contrary, in the situation of coercion by threat of injury to person or property, the elements of first- and second-degree coercion were the same, and the discretion to decide what was an exceptional case warranting prosecution for the lower degree was entrusted to the prosecutor. There was no Apprendi violation because the trial court did not increase the penalty for the crime of which defendant had been convicted based upon facts not found by the jury. Furthermore, the trial court did not instruct the jury that &quot;heinousness&quot; was presumed. Penal Law &sect; 135.65(1) did not shift the burden of proving any element of the crime to the defendant. Even when viewed in a light most favorable to defendant, there was no reasonable view of the evidence that would support a finding that he committed the lesser offense but not the greater offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A jury in the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), convicted defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. The trial court imposed sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The trial court excluded defendant's girlfriend from the courtroom during the trial testimony of two undercover police officers. The appellate court found that was proper. At a reopened Hinton hearing, one officer testified that he understood from what defendant had told him that the girlfriend was involved in selling drugs. The appellate court held that, because both undercovers continued to work in an undercover capacity in the same area where the sale occurred and defendant's girlfriend lived, a credible and legitimate threat existed that the girlfriend might spot the officers on the street during their operations and recognize them from court. This danger could not have been overlooked merely because neither defendant nor his associates had threatened either officer in the past. There was clear judicial error that justified the reopening of the initial Hinton hearing to introduce further evidence. The trial court also correctly excused the officers from disclosing their names due to safety concerns. Defendant's argument that the trial court erred in refusing to submit to the jury a lesser included offense instruction was unpreserved for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a prosecution for criminal sale of a controlled substance based upon defendant's sale of cocaine to an undercover police officer, in which the prosecution sought to exclude all members of the public from the courtroom during the testimony of two undercover officers, with the exception of family members, the court properly exercised its discretion in reopening the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hinton</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hearing to correct its initial error in declining to exclude defendant's girlfriend and to receive additional testimony regarding the particularized threat posed by the girlfriend because she lived with defendant in the vicinity of the instant drug sale where the undercovers were actively operating and was also allegedly involved in the drug trade. Pursuant to established case law, the girlfriend's residence in the specific area of continuing undercover operations was itself sufficient to warrant her exclusion from the courtroom during the testimony of the undercover officers. Under the circumstances, there was clear judicial error that justified the prosecution's request to reopen the hearing to introduce further evidence. The court's discretionary determination to reopen the hearing was also warranted in view of the need for greater flexibility in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hinton</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hearings to protect the safety of undercover officers and their families.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a prosecution for criminal sale of a controlled substance based upon defendant's sale of cocaine to an undercover police officer, defendant's confrontation rights were not violated by the trial court's ruling permitting two undercover officers to testify under assumed names. The prosecution's evidence at the initial </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hinton </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">hearing was sufficient to establish that the officers should be excused from disclosing their names due to safety concerns, and such concerns outweighed defendant's interest in learning the names of the officers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Preservation of Issue for Review -- Failure to Charge Lesser Included Offense </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Defendant's argument that the trial court committed reversible error in refusing to submit to the jury a lesser included offense was unpreserved for appellate review. By failing to request that the court charge the lesser included offense or by failing to object to its refusal to charge, defendant failed to preserve an issue of law for review. Nor did the prosecutor's request that the court charge the lesser included offense suffice to preserve the issue on defendant's behalf.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Lesser Included Offense -- Controlled Substances </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In a prosecution for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree based upon defendant's sale of cocaine to an undercover police officer, although the issue was unpreserved for appellate review, the trial court properly denied the prosecutor's request to charge the lesser included offense of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, in light of the weak agency defense and the substantial evidence that defendant was acting as a drug seller. There was no reasonable view of the undercover's testimony that defendant unlawfully possessed narcotics, but did not sell them. In any event, any error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner owners, and others, brought a CPLR art. 78 proceeding challenging a determination of the trustees of respondent village which authorized the village to close on the sale of a municipal parking lot to respondent buyer of the property and to enter into a purchase money mortgage with the buyer. The Supreme Court, Nassau County (New York), denied the petition and, in effect, dismissed the proceeding. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The petition asserted, inter alia, that the subject parking lot was impressed with a public trust, and therefore could not be sold by the village for private use without specific authorization from the state legislature, and that taking back the purchase money mortgage constituted an unconstitutional loan by a municipality to a private entity. The appellate court found that the owners submitted no evidence showing that the parking lot at issue had been dedicated for public use through express provisions in a deed or legislative enactment, and thus failed to carry their burden of proof. In any event, Village Law &sect; 1-102(1) empowered the village sell its property, and the owners cited no authority for the proposition that the village's power to dispose of surplus property under Village Law &sect; 1-102(1) was constrained by the public trust doctrine where the property in question was not used for park or recreational purposes. However, the purchase money mortgage entered into by the village and the buyer was a &quot;loan&quot; and therefore was impermissible under the Gift or Loan Clause, N.Y. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment was modified by granting that branch of the petition which was to annul so much of the determination as authorized the village to enter into a purchase money mortgage with the buyer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Respondents, a town supervisor and a town, appealed an amended order and judgment by the Westchester County Supreme Court (New York) that granted petitioner resident's CPLR art. 78 petition to declare that Town Law &sect; 232 prohibited the town from financing the cost of acquiring certain property for parkland by imposing a tax solely upon property owners residing in the unincorporated area of the town.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The park was purchased through the joint efforts of the town, the county, and the state. The resident, who lived in the unincorporated area of the town, claimed, and the trial court agreed, that since the park was open to all residents, its cost should be borne by all of the town's taxpayers. The appellate court found that the Finneran Law, L 1982, ch. 891, countered the effect of Town Law &sect; 232 by directing that all costs of any public park were to be raised by the levy of a tax upon the land located outside of the incorporated town. Therefore, the town followed the &quot;established procedure&quot; by requiring the cost of the park be paid solely by residents in the unincorporated portions of the town. The fact that the town effectively opened the parks to all residents was not a basis upon which the town could alter the allocation of costs mandated by the Finneran Law. In addition, the Finneran Law was not applied. Instead of burdening the taxpayers of the unincorporated area in the amount of $ 10.9 million for a restricted park, the town has chosen to require that they pay one-third of that amount for an unrestricted park. Therefore, the resident was not entitled to CPLR art. 78 relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The amended order and judgment were reversed, the petition for a judgment declaring that Town Law &sect; 232 prohibited the allocation of costs to certain residents was denied, the CPLR art. 78 petition was denied in its entirety, and it was declared that the town correctly allocated the cost of the park.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parks and Parkways -- Allocation of Cost of Park Lands </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent Town of Greenburgh properly imposed the cost of a park that is located in the unincorporated area of the Town of Greenburgh only upon the taxpayers of the Town's unincorporated area even though the park was open to use by all town residents, including those who resided in its incorporated villages. Ordinarily, the cost of parkland that was for the benefit of all the residents of a town would be borne by all of the town's taxpayers (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Town Law &sect; 232). Special legislation applicable only in the Town of Greenburgh (L 1982, ch 891 [Finnernan Law]), however, required that the cost of the park be borne only by the taxpayers of the Town's unincorporated area. The Finneran Law also provided that the park may not be used by residents of the incorporated villages that did not choose to bear their share of the park's costs. Although the Town had chosen not to deny access to the park to residents of the noncontributing villages due to state and federal subsidy considerations even though the Finnernan Law required that it do so, full compliance with the Finneran Law by restricting use of the park was not the relief sought by petitioner and was not a basis upon which the Town might alter the allocation of costs. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A police officer stopped a Mercedes Benz with a rear window that appeared to be heavily tinted. A tint meter indicated that the level of light transmittance was 10% and, thus, in violation of Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 375(12-a)(b)(4) which did not allow light transmittance of less than 70%. The vehicle had Georgia license plates, and defendant indicated that he was Georgia resident. The officer obtained information that Georgia required light transmittance of 32%; however, that statute had been held unconstitutional prior to the stop. On appeal, the court affirmed. While it was argued that the officer knew that defendant was exempt under Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 250(1) from the requirements of Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 375(12-a)(b)(4) based on the vehicle's Georgia plates, the officer did not know whether defendant was the vehicle owner or whether the vehicle was properly registered in Georgia. Thus, the officer had probable cause to make the stop as the tint appeared to violate New York law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant lessor appealed an order by the Queens County Supreme Court (New York) that denied its motion to dismiss plaintiff's personal injury complaint; the lessor claimed that the Graves Amendment, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30106, barred the plaintiff's vicarious liability action against it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The plaintiff allegedly was injured in a two-car collision involving the lessor's car. The complaint did not allege any affirmative negligence on the part of the lessor, but sought damages from it based on vicarious liability. The appellate court found that the Graves Amendment aided in the regulation of the national market for leased and rented automobiles, which were &quot;things in&quot; interstate commerce. It also regulated an economic &quot;class of activities&quot; that, taken in the aggregate, substantially affected interstate commerce. Accordingly, the statute was constitutional, and the plaintiff's cause of action against the lessor based solely on vicarious liability failed to state a cause of action. Therefore, the trial court should have the lessor's motion to dismiss the complaint.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff's tort claim against the lessor of the vehicle involved in his automobile accident based solely upon vicarious liability was dismissed as being preempted by the federal statute which preempted Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect;388 by barring vicarious liability actions against professional lessors and renters of vehicles (49 USC &sect;30106). Supreme Court erred in finding the federal statute unconstitutional as exceeding congressional power under the Commerce Clause (US Const, art I, &sect;8 [3]). The rental and lease of vehicles, and the conditions under which such transactions occur, were economic activities impacting the national market. Consequently, since the federal statute aided in the regulation of both instrumentalities of, and things in, interstate commerce, the statute was a constitutional exercise of congressional power to legislate under the Commerce Clause. The fact that the statute regulated an economic activity by preempting rules of state tort law did not make it unconstitutional.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the trial court properly found the attorney liable to the recipient for the faxes sent to the recipient and a former subtenant on the recipient's fax machine.

Additionally, under the doctrine of comity, the court made a voluntary decision to defer to the laws and policies of Louisiana, noting that the underlying events had no connection to New York. The Louisiana judgment was not a judgment within the meaning of CPLR &sect; 5402 because the statute only contemplated an actual judgment that was enforceable in the jurisdiction in which it was rendered.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judgments -- Foreign Judgment -- Full Faith and Credit -- Judgment Unenforceable in Rendering Jurisdiction Not Subject to Enforcement in New York </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A judgment obtained by plaintiffs against the Louisiana Department of Transportation in a Louisiana class action arising out of their property losses from a devastating flood could not be docketed and enforced in New York where the judgment remained unpaid due to the absence of an appropriation by the Louisiana legislature as provided by the laws and constitution of that state. The fact that the contingent award of damages to plaintiffs was denominated a &quot;judgment&quot; under Louisiana law did not render it a foreign judgment subject to enforcement pursuant to CPLR 5402. That statute contemplates a judgment that is enforceable in the rendering jurisdiction, and excludes a nominal judgment like the judgment awarded here that is unenforceable in the rendering jurisdiction. Under the Full Faith and Credit Clause (US Const, art IV, &sect; 1), New York would only be required to give the Louisiana judgment the same preclusive effect that Louisiana would give under its own law. The Louisiana judgment could not be given any greater effect in New York than it would in Louisiana. Consequently, since plaintiffs' judgment would not become &quot;payable&quot; against the State of Louisiana until the state legislature appropriated the funds for that purpose, it could not be enforced in New York in an effort to circumvent Louisiana's laws and state constitution, especially where New York had no discernible interest in the matter. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance (agency) appealed an order by the New York County Supreme Court (New York) that, inter alia, granted plaintiff legal aliens' motion for summary judgment, enjoined the agency from failing to provide assistance to the aliens and the class in Social Services Law &sect; 209(2), directed that the agency provide retroactive benefits, and certified the class.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The legal aliens were originally eligible for Federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and additional state payments (ASP), but became ineligible solely by reason of their failure to become American citizens within the allotted seven years. The court found that the Legislature intended to guarantee all legally resident aged, blind, and disabled persons, citizen and non-citizen alike, with assistance at the more generous level set forth in &sect; 209(2). The aliens were not seeking SSI or ASP; they were seeking to increase their monthly grants for safety net assistance pursuant to Social Services Law &sect; 131-a(2) to the standard of monthly need set by Social Services Law &sect; 209(2). The State could not stop paying benefits at the level it established in 1974 merely because the federal government chose to deny SSI benefits to a particular subgroup. The class certification was affirmed with the proviso that the ultimate eligibility determination would rest with the agency, provided, of course, that such determination was not based on improper factors or considerations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The local law opened eight routes traversing state forest lands for use by all-terrain vehicles (ATVs). Petitioners claimed, inter alia, that respondents' adoption of the local law failed to comply with the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA), ECL art. 8. The trial court granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment on the basis that the State owned the land underlying the routes in question and that respondents failed to submit sufficient proof to raise a question of fact as to whether the subject routes were &quot;highways by use&quot; within the meaning of Highway Law &sect; 189. On appeal, the court affirmed although for different reasons. Instead, the court held that respondents failed to comply with SEQRA as the adoption of the local law that could affect the environment constituted an &quot;action&quot; within ECL 8-0105(4) and required the town to ascertain whether the action might involve one or more other agencies. The town failed to designate the land manager for the underlying forest preserve as the lead agency or confer with the manager. Respondents also failed to take the required &quot;hard look&quot; at the various environmental impacts. Therefore, the local law had to be annulled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court rejected defendant's argument that Penal Law &sect; 490.20 was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him. Defendant could not have reasonably contended that in threatening a district attorney (DA), his family and others with murder unless the DA ceased prosecuting certain types of cases, he did not intend to influence the policy of government by intimidation or coercion or affect the conduct of government by murder, assassination or kidnapping, pursuant to Penal Law &sect; 490.20(1). Defendant also could not have reasonably claimed that he did not thereby cause a reasonable expectation of fear. It was error, however, for the trial court to deny defendant's motion to suppress his statements to a police officer because the statements were solicited when defendant was in custody and in violation of his Miranda rights. The finding that defendant's initial statement was spontaneous was not supported by the record. Defendant's warned statements were obtained as part of a single continuous chain of events and also needed to be suppressed.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In the Penal Law &sect; 490.20 prosecution of defendant for making a terroristic threat by threatening the lives of the District Attorney and several other people unless the District Attorney ceased any prosecutions involving violations of Penal Law article 490, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant. The statutory language of Penal Law &sect; 490.20 sufficiently apprises persons of ordinary intelligence of the type of conduct that is forbidden and provides law enforcement officials with clear standards for enforcement. Defendant could not reasonably contend that in threatening to murder several people unless the District Attorney ceased prosecuting certain cases, he did not intend to &quot;influence the policy of a unit of government by intimidation or coercion[ ] or affect the conduct of a unit of government by murder, assassination or kidnapping&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 490.20 [1]). Moreover, defendant, having conceded that the District Attorney could have feared that defendant would have an accomplice pursue his threats in the letter to murder an extensive list of people &quot;by the end of the year,&quot; could not reasonably claim that he did not &quot;thereby cause[ ] a reasonable expectation or fear of the imminent commission of such offense&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 490.20 [1]).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In the prosecution of defendant for making a terroristic threat in a letter to the District Attorney, statements made by defendant to a police investigator in the detention facility where defendant was being held on unrelated charges were elicited in violation of defendant's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights and should have been suppressed. The interrogation, which took place in a classroom with correction officers standing outside the door while defendant was not permitted to leave on his own, was custodial in nature, and the investigator was obligated to inform defendant of his rights. Defendant admitted to writing the letter after the investigator explained why he was there and described the questions he intended to ask defendant regarding the letter, but before the investigator read him his rights. The investigator's explanation to defendant regarding why he wanted to speak with defendant was the functional equivalent of interrogation, and defendant's statement that he &quot;wrote it&quot; was not spontaneous. Although the investigator read defendant his rights immediately after defendant admitted to writing the letter, the incriminating statements defendant made after the warnings were administered were also inadmissible, as there was not a definite, pronounced break in questioning so as to provide defendant with sufficient time to reflect upon the situation and return him to the status of one who is not under the influence of questioning.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Harmless and Prejudicial Error -- Admission of Statements Elicited in Violation of Defendant's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In the prosecution of defendant for making a terroristic threat in a letter to the District Attorney, the improper admission during trial of incriminating statements elicited in violation of defendant's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights in which defendant admitted to writing the letter in response to the District Attorney's prosecution of defendant's father was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

Although defendant admitted during his parole revocation hearing that he threatened the safety of his parole officer and a deputy sheriff in the letter, he presented evidence that he was on Lithium and Paxil at the time of that hearing. Moreover, the People highlighted defendant's confession to the police investigator in urging the jury to reject the testimony of defendant's father, and the jury had requested a read-back of the investigator's trial testimony regarding defendant's confession. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In an adoption proceeding pursuant to Domestic Relations Law art. 7, appellants, prospective adoptive parents, an adoption agency, and the nonparty birth mother, separately sought review of an order entered by the Family Court, Queens County (New York), which, after a hearing, in effect, denied the petition and dismissed the proceeding on the basis that respondent biological father's consent was required for the adoption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The birth mother, who was 14 years old at the time of the subject child's birth, had executed an extrajudicial consent to the adoption. The family court had determined that the birth mother's extrajudicial consent was invalid and that the biological father's consent was required because, inter alia, the child was under six months old at the time of placement. On appeal, the court affirmed and remitted. While the New York Court of Appeals had found Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111(1)(e), regarding a biological father's consent to adoption, unconstitutional in its entirety, judicially-created interim criteria for consent had been established. Because the evidence indicated that the biological father contacted the birth mother's family about four months prior to the child's birth and acknowledged paternity, asked to be present for the child's birth, was incorrectly told that he could not commence a paternity proceeding until after the child's birth, and actually commenced a paternity proceeding under Family Ct Act &sect; 517 and a custody proceeding within a month after the child's birth, the court held that the biological father had met the judicially-created criteria for consent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the family court's order and remitted the matter to the family court to set a date for the production of the child by the prospective adoptive parents, for a determination of where the subject child should reside pending resolution of the biological father's custody proceeding, and for a determination of the biological father's custody proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adoption--Consent.--Biological father's consent to adoption was mandated by statutory and due process requirements (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Domestic Relations Law &sect;111 [1] [e])--during relevant six-month period, biological father publicly acknowledged paternity and exhibited willingness to assume full parental responsibilities; however, those efforts were rebuffed by birth mother's family--since biological father was minor at time he had sexual relations with birth mother, his conduct could be classified as sexual misconduct on ground that birth mother was under 17 years old, but it could not be classified as statutory rape; thus, there was no basis to conclude that biological father's concerns were more penal than paternal--fact that biological father involved his own mother in process militated in his favor since it demonstrated public acknowledgment of paternity and intent to secure custody with her help--although paternity proceeding and custody proceeding were commenced after child was placed for adoption, biological father's conduct prior to child's placement for adoption was sufficient to establish that his consent was required for placement of child for adoption; since he was not informed of birth mother's plans or child's birth until after child was surrendered for adoption, his failure to immediately assume custody could not be considered waiver--because birth mother's medical expenses were paid by Medicaid, biological father's failure to contribute to those expenses was not determinative--in addition, relocation of biological father's family during birth mother's pregnancy could not be deemed to constitute waiver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adoption--Surrender of Child.--Extrajudicial surrender by birth mother, who was 14 years old at time, was invalid since she was acting under duress imposed upon her by maternal grandmother, who threatened to return her to foster care if she did not execute surrender; moreover, she did not have independent counsel, and her wishes for open adoption were not explicitly provided for.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In two child protective proceedings under Family Ct Act art. 10, appellant father sought review of so much of an order of disposition of the Family Court, Queens County (New York), which was entered upon a prior fact-finding order, entered upon his default, finding, inter alia, that he had abused the first child and had derivatively neglected the second child, and upon an order denying his motion for summary judgment dismissing the petitions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">While the father was making the bed in a bedroom adjoining the kitchen in his apartment, the first child crawled out of the bedroom and into the kitchen. When he heard the first child scream a few minutes later, the father ran to the kitchen where he observed a woman who also lived in the apartment putting water on the first child's face. The first child was treated for first and second degree burns. After a Family Ct Act &sect; 1028 hearing, the family court determined that neither the father nor the mother harmed the first child as the mother was at the laundromat when the injury occurred and the woman was alone in the room with the first child when he was injured. On appeal, the court reversed the denial of summary judgment to the father. While Family Ct Act &sect; 1046(a)(ii) permitted an inference to establish a prima facie case of abuse of neglect against the father because the first child suffered an injury which would not ordinarily occur in the absence of any act of omission of the caretakers, the evidence was sufficient to rebut the statutory inference of fault. No evidentiary proof was submitted by petitioner agency to establish the existence of a triable issue of fact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court dismissed the appeal from the order of disposition except as it brought up for review the prior order denying  summary judgment. The court reversed the order of disposition insofar as reviewed, granted the father's motion for summary judgment, dismissed the petitions as asserted against the father, modified the order denying the motion, and vacated so much of the fact-finding order and order of disposition as pertained to the father.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant civic associations challenged respondent Long Island Power Authority's (LIPA's) order adopting a findings statement under the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA), ECL art. 8, and authorizing agreements to construct and operate a dual-fuel, combined-cycle turbine generator. The Supreme Court, Nassau County (New York), denied the petition and dismissed certain causes of act. The associations appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The associations lacked standing to allege a violation of Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020-f(aa) because their status as ratepayers did not show a sufficient potential injury in fact. The LIPA's request for proposals and memorandum of understanding for a feasibility study did not trigger SEQRA review as they did not commit the LIPA to a specific project plan. The LIPA's failure to complete parts 2 and 3 of the environmental assessment form did not nullify the entire environmental review procedure where a draft and final environmental impact statement had been compiled. The LIPA satisfied its SEQRA obligations where it thoroughly analyzed the environmental impacts, and its conclusion was supported by accepted governmental guidelines and scientific authorities. Moreover, it had not engaged in improper segmentation by failing to analyze an interstate natural gas pipeline as environmental review of that pipeline was preempted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's regulatory authority. Finally, the State Finance Law &sect; 123-b claim was properly dismissed as the conclusory allegations were insufficient to show that the challenged expenditures were an illegal use of state funds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation--Environmental Quality Review.--Challenges to determinations of Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) authorizing power purchase agreement and other related agreements regarding construction and operation of turbine generator (project) were dismissed--LIPA, as lead agency, properly commenced review pursuant to State Environmental Quality Review Act ([ECL art 8] SEQRA) before &quot;any significant authorization [was] granted for a specific proposal&quot; to require filing of environmental impact statement (EIS); neither issuance of request for proposals nor memorandum of understanding entered into between LIPA and gas company pursuant to which gas company would conduct feasibility study exploring possible construction of natural gas pipeline to project site committed LIPA to &quot;specific project plan&quot; or &quot;definite course of future decisions&quot;--failure of LIPA to complete Parts 2 and 3 of full environmental assessment form (EAF) did not require nullification of entire environmental review procedure--LIPA took &quot;hard look&quot; at potential environmental impacts of project in final EIS (FEIS), and adequately analyzed reasonable range of alternatives to project--LIPA's segmentation of natural gas pipeline from environmental review of project was not improper; although project and natural gas pipeline to supply fuel to project were part of integrated and cumulative development plan, environmental review of pipeline under SEQRA was preempted by regulatory authority of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; LIPA was prohibited from engaging in &quot;concurrent site-specific environmental review&quot;--&quot;new information&quot; that appellants brought to attention of LIPA after issuance of FEIS was not of type that would require further environmental review of project. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant challenged the denial of his motion to suppress. The appellate court concluded that the hearing court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress a handgun. Defendant, by his words and conduct, consented to the limited warrantless search conducted by the detective at his house. Thus, defendant's contention regarding whether there were exigent circumstances to justify the warrantless search were rendered academic. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the appellate court found that it was legally sufficient to establish defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court was satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence. Contrary to defendant's contention, he was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Defendant's contention that CPL 270.10 was unconstitutional was unpreserved for appellate review under CPL 470.05(2), and, in any event, was not properly before the appellate court due to defendant's failure to notify the Attorney General that he was challenging the constitutionality of a state statute.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the town sought to condemn the property to preserve it as farmland and maintain open space and scenic vistas. At the public hearing the property's agricultural history was disclosed, as well as the town's unsuccessful attempts to acquire the property through a negotiated sale. The court found, inter alia, that the record fully supported the town's decision to condemn the property. The town satisfied the requirements of EDPL 202(A), which also satisfied the due process requirements of the federal and state constitutions. The developer failed to assert any significant potential for environmental harm that might result from condemnation. The town's stated reasons for acquiring the property were all legitimate public purposes. The mere fact that condemnation would provide incidental benefits to private individuals did not invalidate the town's determination since the public purpose was dominant.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The determination of respondent Town to acquire by condemnation a 39-acre parcel of land located in a 500-acre &quot;Farmland Protection Area&quot; that petitioner had purchased for residential development was confirmed. Petitioner received adequate notice of the purpose of the proposed condemnation, which was to ensure the continuation of the property as farmland, and a reasonable opportunity to testify and present evidence at the required public hearing (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;EDPL 202 [a]). The statutory scheme was not unconstitutional as applied due to the failure to afford parties adversely affected by a proposed taking the right to an adversarial hearing at which government officials could be cross-examined. The statutory procedures followed by respondent satisfied all due process requirements. Petitioner's allegations that proponents of the condemnation were biased and/or acting in bad faith did not warrant judicially transforming the public hearing required by statute into a full-fledged adversarial proceeding.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Environmental Conservation -- Environmental Quality Review -- Preservation of Farmland</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondent Town complied with the requirements of the State Environmental Quality Review Act in determining to acquire by condemnation a 39-acre parcel of land located in a 500-acre &quot;Farmland Protection Area&quot; that petitioner had purchased for residential development. Respondent's stated purpose in acquiring the property was to ensure its continuation as farmland. Since the acquistion would have a beneficial impact on the environment, respondent's issuance of a negative declaration with regard to any adverse environmental effects was appropriate, and the preparation of an environmental impact statement was unnecessary (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">6 NYCRR 617.7 [a] [2]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent Domain -- Public Use -- Preservation of Farmland</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The determination of respondent Town to acquire by condemnation a 39-acre parcel of land located in a 500-acre &quot;Farmland Protection Area&quot; that petitioner had purchased for residential development was confirmed. Respondent's acquisition of the property in order to preserve its use as farmland and maintain open space and scenic vistas served a legitimate public purpose, especially in view of the State's express public policy to &quot;promote, foster, and encourage the agricultural industry&quot; (Agriculture and Markets Law &sect; 3) and the approval by town residents of bond acts to finance the acquisition of &quot;open space, farmland and wildlife habitats.&quot; Petitioner failed to demonstrate that the proposed condemnation was merely a pretext for improperly conferring benefits upon private persons. The property had been continuously farmed for more than a century before petitioner purchased it for development purposes, with full knowledge that it had been targeted for preservation as farmland. Since allowing farming to continue on the property was fully consistent with the purpose of the condemnation, the fact that one or more individual farmers might benefit was merely incidental, and did not render the public benefit to be achieved by condemnation illusory. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The appellate court rejected the wireless telephone users' argument that the monthly surcharge on wireless telephones for, inter alia, enhanced 911 services was a taking because it was a user fee rather than a general tax, and because the State had not used the revenue effectively to implement enhanced 911 services. The surcharge assessed under County Law &sect; 309 paid for services received by, and for the benefit of, the general public. The benefits flowed to the general public because everyone, not just wireless telephone users, benefited from the enhancements to 911 service. The extension to wireless telephone users of a surcharge that was initially placed on land-line telephone users to support public safety programs could hardly be said to impose an unfair burden.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner owners of property brought a CPLR art. 78 action against respondent assessor, contending that the methodology employed during a specific tax year was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">It was undisputed that the original petition named only the assessor as a respondent and failed to name either the county or the school district as a party. By the time an amended petition adding these entities was filed, the statute of limitations had expired. The trial court dismissed the proceeding on two distinct grounds, namely, statute of limitations and failure to join necessary parties. The appellate court found that the owners' failure to timely join the county and the school district, which were clearly necessary parties, mandated dismissal of the proceeding. The failure to name the county and the school district in the first instance was a mistake of law not encompassed by the relation back doctrine. In other words, the owners were clearly &quot;fully aware&quot; of the identity and existence of both the county and the school district but, apparently, failed to appreciate that these entities were legally required to be named in proceedings of this type, which was a mistake of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs, licensed newsstand operators and a trade association, appealed an order by the New York County Supreme Court (New York) that denied their motion for a preliminary injunction and granted summary judgment to defendants, a city, its officials, and agencies, in the operators' action challenging New York City, N.Y., Loc. Laws No. 64 (2003) regarding the installation and maintenance of newsstands and the placement of advertising thereon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Pursuant to Local Law 64, all newsstands in the city were to be replaced by structures to be built, owned, and maintained by a corporate franchisee. The newly constructed newsstands were to be operated by the individual licensees who owned the newsstands that were replaced. The city would receive an annual payment from the franchisee in the form of a franchise fee and from revenue received through advertising on the newsstands. The court found, inter alia, that although the city officials had discretion in determining whether a particular newsstand was in a &quot;hazardous condition,&quot; the condition had to present a threat to public safety that was sufficiently comparable to the statutory examples. Nothing in Local Law 64 required that the advertisements it authorized be placed on the front portion of the newsstands. The operators could display a sign that they had no control over the content of the advertising panels. Neither the operators nor the trade association had standing to challenge the reimbursement requirement of Local Law 64. The plaintiffs' nonconstitutional claims were without merit or barred by the statutes of limitations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs, licensed newsstand operators within the City of New York, were not entitled to preliminary injunctive relief on First Amendment grounds preventing the City of New York from implementing a 2003 local law which required replacement of all existing newsstands with newsstands owned, constructed and maintained by a single franchisee, required that the new newsstands be designed and built in compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act (42 USC &sect; 12131 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), and imposed siting and display space requirements for new licensees (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 20-241.1). Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the local law would impermissibly infringe upon First Amendment rights by giving city officials unfettered discretion to issue and revoke licenses based upon an unconstitutionally vague criterion of avoiding &quot;hazardous conditions.&quot; Rather, the term &quot;hazardous condition&quot; was given content by the specific and nonexclusive objective examples enumerated in the statute (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Administrative Code &sect; 20-231 [d]). Moreover, any nonenumerated circumstance found by the Department of Transportation (DOT) to constitute a &quot;hazardous condition&quot; was required to present a threat to public safety that was sufficiently comparable to the statutory examples to allow courts to police DOT determinations on an &quot;as applied&quot; basis. Furthermore, plaintiffs raised only the mere and abstract possibility of constitutional injury to the exercise of their First Amendment rights with respect to the franchisee's placement of advertisement panels on the upper front portion of newsstands.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Plaintiffs, licensed newsstand operators within the City of New York, lacked standing to challenge on First Amendment grounds the implementation of portions of a 2003 local law requiring replacement of all existing newsstands with newsstands owned, constructed and maintained by a single franchisee (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 20-241.1). Plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the reimbursement requirement of the law requiring the operator of a newsstand &quot;that is not a replacement newsstand and that has been constructed and installed by the franchisee . . . [to] reimburse the franchisee for the cost of such construction and installation&quot; where the individual plaintiffs would be receiving &quot;replacement newsstands from the franchisee free of charge&quot; (Administrative Code &sect; 20-228 [e]), and thus could not show that they would actually be harmed by the reimbursement requirement for standing purposes. Furthermore, the trade association of licensed newsstand operators likewise lacked standing to challenge the reimbursement requirement as an &quot;impermissible levy&quot; on First Amendment rights, since it failed to demonstrate that any of its individual members would in fact be required to reimburse the franchisee for a &quot;replacement newsstand.&quot; Moreover, the City's failure to pursue the standing issue on appeal did not preclude dismissal of this constitutional claim on standing grounds, since the lack of standing in the context of the constitutionality of a statute cannot ordinarily be waived by the parties.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Plaintiffs, licensed newsstand operators within the City of New York, were not entitled to preliminary injunctive relief on First Amendment grounds preventing the City of New York from implementing a 2003 local law relating to the ownership, installation and maintenance of, and placement of advertisements on newsstands (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 20-241.1). The law required the replacement of all existing newsstands with newsstands owned, constructed and maintained by a single franchisee. Plaintiffs' claim that the local law would violate their First Amendment rights by compelling them to disseminate messages placed on the newsstands they would operate, over which they would have no control, lacked merit. Under the law, plaintiffs would not own the new newsstands or have any legally cognizable property rights in the exterior portions of the structures on which advertisements would be placed. Plaintiffs would thus have no right to control the advertising on the structures. The actual owner of the new newsstands, the franchisee, could not be required to display on its property only those messages with which the operators agreed. Moreover, there was nothing in the law that would prohibit the operator of a newsstand from using a portion of the available space in the front of the newsstand to display a sign making clear that the operator had no control over the content on the messages on the advertising panels. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff domestic corporation sued defendant foreign corporation in the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), to compel the foreign corporation to produce its shareholder lists under Business Corporation Law &sect; 1315(a). The trial court denied the domestic corporation's motion to compel, and it appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The trial court held the foreign corporation did not meet the heightened standard of &quot;doing business&quot; applicable to Business Corporation Law &sect; 1312. The appellate court held &quot;doing business,&quot; under Business Corporation Law art. 13, was interpreted under two standards. A heightened standard applied to statutes raising concerns about interfering with the Commerce Clause authority reserved to Congress, and a less strict standard, in CPLR 302, applied when such concerns were not present. The standard applicable to Business Corporation Law &sect; 1315 was the less strict standard because it raised no Commerce Clause concerns. Under this standard, the foreign corporation, through its wholly owned subsidiary and acting as its principal, did business in New York. The foreign corporation, a shell holding company, which functioned in New York through its sole operational subsidiary, was, thus, subject to &sect; 1315's obligation to make available its shareholder list. It was unnecessary to show, in addition to dominion and control, that the subsidiary was used as an instrumentality of wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Corporations -- Inspection of Books and Records -- Inspection of Record of Shareholders of Foreign Corporation -- Improper Application of Heightened &quot;Doing Business&quot; Standard </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff, a wholly owned New York subsidiary of a foreign corporation formed in connection with an attempt by its parent company to acquire control of defendant, a Wisconsin holding company whose sole operational subsidiary was a commercial air carrier registered to do business in New York, was entitled to relief, as a shareholder, compelling defendant to produce its current shareholder lists pursuant to Business Corporation Law &sect; 1315. Defendant was &quot;doing business&quot; in New York through the activities of its wholly owned subsidiary for purposes of the shareholder record inspection statute. Supreme Court, in denying plaintiff's motion to compel the production of defendant's shareholder lists, erred in determining that the statute required a higher level of &quot;doing business&quot; than the traditional jurisdictional standard for &quot;doing business&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPLR 302) in order to avoid an unconstitutional infringement on interstate commerce. In view of the long-standing precedent requiring that the statute be liberally construed in favor of the stockholder, there was no basis for Supreme Court to apply the heightened &quot;doing business&quot; standard of Business Corporation Law &sect; 1312 to Business Corporation Law &sect; 1315, which merely provided an in-state procedural device for New York residents to obtain a shareholder list and in no way imposed an unjustified burden on interstate commerce. Supreme Court also erred in considering the availability of similar relief in Wisconsin and whether other means of communication with defendant's shareholders were available to plaintiff. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In an action, inter alia, to recover damages for false arrest and malicious prosecution, plaintiff sought review of an order of the Supreme Court, Kings County (New York), which granted those branches of a cross-motion pursuant to CPLR &sect; 3211(a)(5) to dismiss, as time barred, the fifth cause of action of the amended complaint, a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim, insofar as asserted against defendants, a city and its police department (the city).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff also sought review of the dismissal of so much of the &sect; 1983 claim as was predicated upon claims of false arrest and false imprisonment insofar as asserted against defendant detective. Plaintiff had been arrested on, inter alia, a second degree murder charge and was incarcerated for over a year before the charges against him were dismissed. After filing an initial complaint that asserted that the city had failed to properly train and supervise its officers, plaintiff was permitted to amend to allege, inter alia, the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim that his constitutional rights were violated as a result of the city's policies and customs. The &sect; 1983 claim against the city should not have been dismissed because the amended complaint related back under CPLR &sect; 203(f) to the negligent hiring and training allegations in the original complaint. While the state law claims for false arrest and imprisonment had been dismissed, that did not vitiate the related allegations in the original complaint, and notice of claim requirements under General Municipal Law &sect; 50-e did not apply to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims. Thus, the fifth cause of action was improperly dismissed as to the detective.</SPAN></P>

In order to qualify for resentencing on his A-II conviction, defendant requested reinstatement of his original sentence on the A-I conviction. The appellate court found that defendant received the minimum sentence allowed under the 2004 DLRA, L 2004, ch. 738, which was precisely the sentence that he requested. Defendant failed to meet the &quot;eligibility requirements&quot; for receiving merit time set forth in Correction Law &sect; 803(1)(d) because he committed two serious disciplinary infractions while incarcerated. Consequently, he did not qualify for resentencing under the 2005 DLRA, L 2005, ch. 643. Defendant's other contentions were without merit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant, having been resentenced in July 2005 on his 2002 class A-I felony drug conviction to the minimum sentence allowed under the 2004 Drug Law Reform Act (DLRA) (L 2004, ch 738, &sect; 23; Penal Law &sect; 70.71), was not entitled to have the resentence vacated on the ground that the resentencing court did not &quot;specify and inform&quot; him of the proposed sentence as required by the 2004 DLRA so that he could obtain the temporary reinstatement of his original sentence on his class A-I felony for the purpose of becoming eligible for resentencing on his class A-II felony conviction under the 2005 DLRA (L 2005, ch 643) to the same sentence previously imposed by the resentencing court. Where, as here, the resentencing court imposes a sentence that is more favorable than the one originally imposed, the imposition of that sentence without first &quot;specifying and informing&quot; the defendant of the proposed sentence, even if a technical violation of the statute, does not entitle the defendant to any relief on appeal.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Drug Law Reform Act -- &quot;Eligibility Requirements&quot; for Resentencing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant, who was convicted in October 2002 of both class A-I and A-II drug felonies and was resentenced on the class A-I felony to the minimum sentence allowed under the 2004 Drug Law Reform Act (DLRA) (L 2004, ch 738, &sect; 23; Penal Law &sect; 70.71), was properly denied resentencing on his A-II conviction under the 2005 DLRA (L 2005, ch 643), since he did not meet the &quot;eligibility requirements&quot; for resentencing under that statute (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correction Law &sect; 851 [2]). Although defendant was more than three years from being parole eligible at the time he filed his second resentencing motion, he failed to meet a second prerequisite for resentencing since he was disqualified from obtaining a merit time allowance by virtue of having committed two serious disciplinary infractions while incarcerated (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Correction Law &sect; 803 [1] [d]; 7 NYCRR 280.2 [b] [3]). Defendant's argument that the phrase &quot;eligibility requirements&quot; referred only to the requirements for earning a merit time allowance, and not also to those for being granted one, lacked merit. Further more, application of the statutory scheme did not violate defendant's equal protection or due process rights. The disparate treatment of A-II felons depending on their disciplinary record and other behavior while incarcerated is rationally related to the valid state objective of granting early release from prison and early termination of parole supervision to those defendants best prepared for reentry into society. Nor was the statutory scheme rendered irrational because certain defendants, like defendant, would be able to petition the courts to convert their indeterminate sentences to a determinate term on their class A-I convictions, but unable to obtain relief from their lifetime terms on their class A-II felony convictions. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioners, four villages and two residents, appealed the judgment of the Supreme Court, Westchester County (New York), which granted the cross-motions to dismiss filed by respondents, a town, its town board, planning board, and board of appeals (the town). Petitioners had brought suit, pursuant to CPLR art. 78, challenging the town's approval of a resolution and a site plan permitting adult student housing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The litigation arose from the town's amendment of its zoning code to permit adult student living facilities. Only four sites in the town were at issue, with each adjacent or near one or more of the villages. The court held that the villages had standing to assert their claims and that the bar to judicial review of zoning changes by adjoining municipalities established by Town Law &sect; 264(4) did not apply to challenges under the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA), ECL 8-0101 et seq. The court held that the right of a municipality, such as the four villages, to challenge the acts of its neighbors must be determined on the basis of the same rules of standing that applied to other litigants. The court held that the residents also had standing to make similar challenges, but had no standing to challenge the town's approval of a site plan for the construction of one of the adult student housing developments. However, the residents did have standing to challenge the town's alleged failure to comply with the procedural particulars required for a zoning change since they owned property in close proximity to the area subject to the zoning change, but the four villages did not.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court modified the judgment granting respondents' cross-motions to dismiss and held that the four villages had standing to sue on the claims asserted except the challenges to the alleged procedural irregularities. Likewise, the residents had standing to assert some, but not all, of their claims. The court reinstated the case and remitted it to the trial court for a determination, on the merits, of the claims that the court reinstated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Capacity to Sue -- Challenge by Adjoining Municipalities to Zoning Change Adopted by Town by Local Law </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Petitioner Villages had the legal capacity in a hybrid CPLR article 78 proceeding and declaratory judgment action to challenge on environmental and certain other grounds respondent Town's adoption of a local law that permitted adult student living facilities as a conditional use in certain residential zones. Petitioners were expressly authorized &quot;to sue and be sued&quot; in &quot;any action or proceeding in any court&quot; (Village Law &sect; 1-102 [5]) and needed no other specific authorization to challenge the adoption of the adult student housing law. Petitioners' ability to sue was not limited by the rule that a municipality, as a creature of the State, may not sue the State, since that rule did not bar an action by one creature of the State against another. Furthermore, Town Law &sect; 264 (4), which provided that a village, although entitled to be heard at a public hearing held by a neighboring town with respect to a proposed zoning change, had no right to seek judicial review of the town's zoning decision, did not otherwise deprive petitioners of the capacity to sue, since the challenged zoning change was the product of a local law, not a zoning enactment. The bar to judicial review of zoning changes by adjoining municipalities did not preclude all statutory claims by a municipality with respect to a zoning enactment of a neighboring municipality, without regard to the source of the authority by which the action was taken. Nor did the statutory bar apply to challenges under the State Environmental Quality Review Act, which contemplated that an adjoining municipality that had a concern about an action had the same right to judicial review as any other &quot;interested&quot; party (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;6 NYCRR 617.2 [s], [t]).   </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Petitioners, as owners of property in close proximity to the area subject to a zoning change, had standing in a hybrid CPLR article 78 proceeding and declaratory judgment action to challenge on environmental and certain other grounds respondent Town's adoption of a local law and revised comprehensive zoning law that permitted adult student living facilities as a conditional use in certain residential zones. Petitioners had an interest in assuring that respondent complied with notice, hearing, voting, filing and publication requirements for the enactment of a local law (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 20). Petitioners also had standing to challenge the adult student housing law as being inconsistent with the Town's comprehensive zoning plan, thereby constituting impermissible spot zoning, and also to assert that respondent failed to comply with statutory regional land use review requirements (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;General Municipal Law &sect; 239-m). Furthermore, petitioners had standing to challenge the adoption of the local law as being violative of the State Environmental Quality Review Act, since it could be inferred from their close proximity to the proposed site of an adult student living facility that they would suffer environmental injury different from that of the public at large. However, petitioners, a married couple, lacked standing to raise equal protection or due process claims based upon the exclusion of unmarried adult student housing from the new zoning district.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Petitioner Villages lacked standing in a hybrid CPLR article 78 proceeding and declaratory judgment action to challenge respondent Town's adoption of a local law and revised comprehensive zoning law that permitted adult student living facilities as a conditional use in certain residential zones on the ground that respondent failed to comply with notice, hearing, voting, filing and publication requirements for the enactment of a local law (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 20). Petitioners had no interest in the respondent's compliance with either its comprehensive plan or the procedural requirements regarding the enactment of a local law. Since petitioners exercised their own zoning authority with respect to property located within their geographical jurisdiction (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Village Law &sect; 7-700), they were beyond the bounds of the mutuality of restriction and benefit underlying the comprehensive plan requirement. Petitioners also lacked standing to raise equal protection or due process claims based upon the exclusion of unmarried adult student housing from the new zoning district. However, petitioners, as adjoining municipalities, had standing to assert that respondent failed to comply with statutory regional land use review requirements (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Municipal Law &sect; 239-m). Furthermore, petitioners established standing to seek judicial review of the negative declaration under the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) that resulted in the law's adoption, where they sufficiently demonstrated that the development permitted by the adult student housing law could have a substantial detrimental effect on the character of their communities, protected by SEQRA, which specifically defined &quot;environment&quot; as including &quot;existing community or neighborhood character&quot; (ECL 8-0105 [6]; 6 NYCRR 617.7 [c] [1] [iv], [v]). </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The purpose of the enabling legislation was for the commission to examine the current supply of hospital and nursing home facilities and to reconfigure the supply to align with the demand or need. The hospital commenced an action seeking injunctive, declaratory, and other relief to prevent its closure. The appellate court found that although the hospital had a protected property interest in its operating certificate, the enabling legislation satisfied the minimum procedural and substantive due process requirements. The hospital was given the opportunity to appear at a public hearing and to submit various documents. The commission's recommendation was not without legal justification, nor was it outrageously arbitrary. Even if the legislative veto provision was unconstitutional, it was severable. The hospital failed to raise an issue of fact whether the enabling legislation was an unreasonable interference with religious freedom. In addition, the enabling legislation did not violate the Federal Contract Clause or the state Presentment Clause, N.Y. Const. art. IV, &sect; 7.

Plaintiffs were afforded procedural due process by having been given the opportunity to appear before the Commission's regional advisory committee at a public hearing and to submit unlimited documents. Furthermore, the Commission's recommendation to close plaintiffs' health care facility did not deprive plaintiffs of their right to substantive due process.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The association lacked standing to bring the action. Where no member of the association had the substantive right to bring suit against the State (local governmental corporate entities and their officers lacked capacity to mount constitutional challenges to acts of the State and State legislation), the association could not rely on its interests to predicate its right to bring the action. Also, the allegations of under funding in the complaint fell outside the scope of State Finance Law &sect; 123-b. Additionally, the individual school board members failed to assert &quot;proof of special harm different in kind or degree from the community in general&quot; and, thus, they were not eligible for common-law taxpayer standing.

The trial court sentenced defendant, as a persistent felony offender, to a term of 15 years to life. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The evidence showed that defendant pushed the victim down as he stole money from the victim's pocket. Defendant then fled into a nearby hotel where, while still in possession of the victim's property, he struggled with other persons. On appeal, the court found that the prosecutor did not add a new theory of robbery when he argued in summation that defendant's use of force included his efforts to forcibly retain the property immediately after taking it, and the prosecutor was entitled to argue that the requisite element of physical force was established as the two uses of force by defendant constituted an unbroken chain of events in the robbery. Further, the trial court properly (1) declined to submit petit larceny as a lesser included offense; (2) declined to reopen the suppression hearing, under CPL 710.40(4), based upon trial testimony by a hotel security guard that allegedly conflicted with hearing testimony by the police; and (3) sentenced defendant as a persistent felony offender, under CPL 400.20(9), as the court based the sentence solely on prior convictions, facts found by the jury, and the court's discretionary evaluation of the seriousness of defendant's criminal history.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Monroe County Court (New York), which convicted defendant, upon a jury verdict, of murder in the first degree, murder in the second degree, and attempted murder in the first degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress certain physical evidence seized from a kennel behind his residence, as the record established that defendant's mother freely and repeatedly consented to a search of the residence and the area around the house. Also, defendant's statements to the police were properly admitted in evidence at trial, as defendant was not placed under arrest until after he was identified as the perpetrator by two of the surviving victims at the hospital, at which time the police had probable cause to arrest him. However, the court agreed with defendant that the second degree felony murder convictions had to be reversed, and those counts of the indictment had to be dismissed pursuant to CPL 300.40(3)(b), because defendant was also convicted of first degree intentional felony murder, and felony murder (pursuant to Penal Law &sect; 125.25(3)) was a lesser-included crime under intentional felony murder. Also, defendant's sentences for first degree murder had to be vacated on the ground that they were imposed after the court gave the deadlock instruction contained in CPL 400.27(10), which was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment was modified on the law by reversing those parts convicting defendant of murder in the second degree and dismissing those counts of the indictment, and by vacating the sentences imposed for murder in the first degree. As modified the judgment was affirmed, and the matter was remitted to the trial court for resentencing on the murder in the first degree counts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Unlawful Search and Seizure--Consent to Search.--Court properly refused to suppress evidence seized from kennel behind defendant's residence--defendant's mother consented to search of residence, and told officers that they could search area around house, but that they could not enter outdoor kennel because dog confined there could be controlled only by defendant; officers waited until Animal Control officers arrived and secured dog before searching that area--defendant's mother gave comprehensive consent to search house and areas surrounding it, and her indication that police could not enter kennel based on presence of dog was insufficient to impose limitation on or constitute revocation of consent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Arrest--Probable Cause.--Defendant's statements to police were admissible; defendant was not placed under arrest until after he was identified as perpetrator by two of surviving victims at hospital, at which time police had probable cause to arrest him; fact that he was placed in handcuffs prior to showup identification at hospital did not transform otherwise valid detention of defendant for showup purposes into full-blown arrest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Confession.--Defendant's contention that his statements to police should have been suppressed because, before he was advised of his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights, he told them that he had previously sold drugs, was rejected; that statement did not require suppression of post-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> statements because it was nonresponsive to officer's question that immediately preceded statement concerning drugs and thus was spontaneous; officer's question was permissible because its purpose was to determine whether defendant was under influence of drugs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Lesser Included Offense--Murder </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Sentence--First Degree Murder--Deadlock Instruction.--Sentences imposed for first degree murder were vacated since they were imposed after court gave deadlock instruction contained in CPL 400.27 (10)--instruction at issue violated NY Constitution because vote for life imprisonment or death, driven by fear that defendant might be parole-eligible if jurors fail to reach unanimity, does not satisfy heightened standard of reliability required by State Constitution. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Jurors--Selection of Jury.--Defendant failed to make requisite prima facie showing of discrimination by prosecutor with respect to prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges against female prospective jurors--although prosecutor exercised majority of his peremptory challenges against female prospective jurors, he peremptorily excused less than 50% of women in jury pool from which petit jury was chosen; consequently, because no showing was made beyond disproportionate number of strikes against women, defendant's claims fell short of requisite burden. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After the Madison County Court (New York) denied defendant's motion to dismiss the charges in the interests of justice, he was convicted of making a terroristic threat (Penal Law &sect; 490.20) and was sentenced to 15 years to life imprisonment. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant told an employee of the county department of social services (DSS) he was going to get a gun and &quot;take care of&quot; a his girlfriend's DSS caseworker and the caseworker's supervisor since &quot;he had nothing to lose&quot;-- he had terminal liver disease. The appellate court held the testimony established that he threatened to kill DSS employees, that he thereby intended to coerce them to influence DSS policy, that he intended through murder to interfere with the DSS's enforcement of its policy, and that his words and conduct caused reasonable fear of the imminent commission of such a murder. Denial of his motion for dismissal in the interest of justice, due to his poor health, was not an abuse of discretion. His counsel was not ineffective for failing to move to disqualify the district attorney, as there was no basis for such a motion. He was properly restrained by leg shackles during trial due to his prior assault conviction, the serious nature of the charges, his threats to witnesses, and his statement that he had nothing to lose because he was dying. As he was a persistent felony offender under Penal Law &sect; 70.10(1), the sentence of 15 years to life was the minimum permissible one.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law--Validity of Statute.--Although issue was unpreserved for review, Penal Law &sect; 490.20 was not unconstitutional as applied--statutory language sufficiently apprises persons of ordinary intelligence of type of conduct that is forbidden and provides law enforcement officials with clear standards for enforcement--defendant claimed that his conduct was not what Legislature had in mind when it enacted statute after terroristic attacks of September 11, 2001 and he should not be labeled terrorist--regardless of Legislature's intent, plain words of Penal Law &sect; 490.20 clearly inform public and law enforcement officials of conduct forbidden by statute.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Making Terroristic Threat.--Evidence was sufficient to support conviction of making terroristic threat--testimony of Department of Social Services (DSS) employees, investigator and other witnesses established that defendant threatened to kill DSS employees, threat was intended to intimidate or coerce public employees to influence DSS's policy regarding contact between children and sex offenders, defendant intended through such murder to interfere with DSS's conduct of enforcing this policy, and his words and conduct caused reasonable fear of imminent commission of such murder; statute eliminates as defenses lack of intent or capability of committing murders, and that threat was made to someone other than person subject to threat (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 490.20 [2])--prosecution's witnesses established each element of offense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Indictment--Dismissal in Interest of Justice.--Dismissal of indictment charging making terroristic threat was not warranted in interest of justice; despite defendant's poor health and his argument that his actions did not fit typical definition of terrorism so as to subject him to these charges, no injustice was likely to result from prosecuting him for threatening lives of public servants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Right to Counsel--Effective Representation </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Fair Trial.--Defendant was not deprived of fair trial due to court's order that he be restrained during trial--court instructed jury three separate times that use of restraints was ordinary security measure and could not be used as any indication of guilt--court articulated reasons for requiring restraints and took efforts to avoid any prejudice to defendant. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Supreme Court, New York County, New York, convicted defendant, after a jury trial, of sexual abuse in the first degree, under Penal Law &sect; 130.65(3), and sentenced him to a term of 5 years. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The instant court found that the verdict was based on legally sufficient evidence. The trial court properly found that the child victim was capable of giving unsworn testimony, and her account of the crime was consistent with defendant's statements to the police. Moreover, there was additional evidence establishing defendant's opportunity to commit the crime, and connecting him to it. Defendant's therapist reported to law enforcement authorities the substance of statements defendant had made relating to an act of sexual abuse of the victim. Even if the therapist's testimony was improper, the error was harmless because defendant waived any privilege when he spoke to the police and gave them the same information he provided to his therapist. Nor was defendant entitled to a new trial on account of his claim premised on the rule of completeness. The trial court correctly determined that an endangering the welfare of a child charge was not a lesser included offense of the sexual abuse charge. Thus, the trial court was not required to submit the endangering charge to the jury. Defendant's claim that the sentence was unconstitutional as applied to him was unpreserved and without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Corroboration as to Sex Offenses.--Verdict was based on sufficient evidence; child victim's account of crime was consistent with defendant's statements to police, and child victim's account and defendant's statements properly corroborated each other; moreover, there was additional evidence establishing defendant's opportunity to commit crime, and connecting him to it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Witnesses--Testimony of Therapist in Sex Case.--In prosecution for sexual abuse, in which defendant's therapist was permitted to testify about statements defendant had made relating to act of sexual abuse of child victim, defendant waived any privilege regarding such testimony when he spoke to police and gave them same information he had provided to therapist. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Appeal--Preservation of Issue for Review </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Harmless and Prejudicial Error.--Although defendant failed to preserve issue for review, any error in precluding testimony that defendant told his therapist that he was &quot;revulsed&quot; by child's presence was harmless; defendant admitted he had rubbed child's &quot;chest and vaginal area&quot; and that he had &quot;played with the little girl,&quot; and statement about defendant's revulsion did not indicate when he became revolted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Lesser Included Offense.--Endangering welfare of child was not lesser included offense of sexual abuse, since it was possible for defendant to have touched victim in manner constituting sexual abuse without requisite mens rea necessary for endangering offense. </SPAN></P>

The New York legislature's finding that registration of sex offenders would allow local law enforcement officials to resolve incidents involving sexual abuse and exploitation promptly and to alert the community when necessary applied equally to child abductors. Since unlawful imprisonment and kidnapping involved either the restraint or abduction of the victim and such conduct was a frequent precursor to a sex offense, the legislature could reasonably have found that kidnappers should be required to register. The legislature found that the policies effectuated in SORA brought New York into compliance with the federal crime control act, now codified at 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 14071. Finally, whether in common parlance defendant was a sex offender, or his offense was a sex offense, was of no legal significance as the legislature had rationally chosen to categorize defendant or the offense as such.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The order of the trial court was reversed. Defendant's motion to be excluded from the classification and registration requirements of Correction Law art. 6-C was denied. The matter was remitted to the trial court for a new SORA risk level assessment hearing and a new determination thereafter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Application of Sex Offender Registration Act to Convicted Child Kidnapper</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's 1976 conviction of kidnapping in the first degree (Penal Law &sect; 135.25 [1]) involving a person less than 17 years old required him to register as a &quot;sex offender&quot; under the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) (Correction Law &sect; 168-a [1], [2] [a] [i]), even though there was no apparent sexual component to his crime. SORA's application to defendant was constitutionally permissible, and did not violate his substantive due process right to be free from arbitrary, capricious and irrational legislation. In light of the facts of defendant's particular crime, it was not irrational to classify him a &quot;sex offender&quot; and subject him to the registration requirements of SORA. The protection of children from the dangers of sexual predators constitutes a legitimate and compelling, governmental purpose. The Legislature could reasonably have concluded in furtherance of that purpose that child kidnappers should be required to register as &quot;sex offenders,&quot; even in the absence of sexual contact, because such conduct is a frequent precursor to a sex offense. Furthermore, the inclusion of defendant's crime as &quot;sex offense&quot; in the State's registration program was necessary to comply with federal standards so that the State would remain eligible to receive federal aid (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;42 USC &sect; 14071 [a] [3] [A] [i]). The Legislature could rationally have determined that it was in the public interest to establish a registration program in compliance with federal law, and, on that basis, have also concluded rationally that requiring the registration of convicted kidnappers furthered the legitimate purposes of the statute, even in the absence of a sexual component to the kidnapping. </SPAN></P>

He was sentenced as a second felony offender under Penal Law &sect; 70.02 to a prison term with post-release supervision. The trial court, without a hearing, entered an order denying defendant's motion under CPL 440.10 and 440.20 to vacate the judgment and set aside the sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The victim testified that she was alone in her apartment during the day and, upon hearing noises, she came out of her bedroom and found defendant and another man in her living room holding large garbage bags. They were hunched over her television disconnecting the electronic components, and complied when she ordered them to leave. Shortly thereafter, defendant and another man were apprehended a few blocks away and the victim identified defendant as one of the intruders. On appeal, the court found that the weight of the credible evidence amply supported the verdict. Additionally, defendant neither overcame the presumption of constitutionality attached to the legislative classification of the crime as a violent felony offense under Penal Law &sect; 70.02(1)(b), nor established any due process deprivation resulting from it. Further, a factual determination that defendant engaged in violence was not a prerequisite to classifying the crime under Penal Law &sect; 70.02, as the conviction alone qualified defendant for the enhanced sentencing that statute provided.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Over the course of two days, defendant committed two armed robberies. The indictments arising from both incidents were consolidated but did not include an assault charge arising from the first robbery. Defendant entered into a plea agreement in full satisfaction of both indictments, including an agreement to waive indictment and be prosecuted by a superior court information charging him with assault in the first degree and to plead guilty thereto. Defendant raised an excessive sentence claim on direct appeal, which was denied. With respect to defendant's motion to vacate, the trial court agreed that the information was jurisdictionally defective. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that the failure to comply with the statutory requirements for waiving indictment did not need to be addressed based on the language of CPL 440.10. CPL 440.10(2)(c) mandated that defendant's motion to vacate be denied because the issue regarding any jurisdictional defect relating to the information could have been raised on direct appeal but was not.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs, a City Councilman and his campaign committee (Councilman), filed suit against defendant New York City Campaign Finance Board. The Supreme Court, New York County (New York), granted the Councilman's motion for a preliminary injunction such that it restrained the Board from conducting a hearing on certain alleged violations and any further adjudication of several alleged violations, and denied the Board's cross-motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Board appealed. The Board issued a violation notice claiming that the Councilman violated the New York City Campaign Finance Act. The appellate court held that the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine was not always inapplicable in proceedings seeking a writ of prohibition or mandamus. The Councilman's claim that his due process rights were violated because the allegations were not specific enough did not allege the type of unconstitutional agency action that was excepted from the exhaustion doctrine. The Councilman had an adequate remedy at law by way of a CPLR art. 78 proceeding. It was within the Board's discretion whether to publicize the names of those who violated the Act. There was no basis to presume that any adverse findings would be made against the Councilman, that such adverse findings would result from inadequate notice, or that the Board intended to publish such findings prior to completion of an art. 78 review. Thus, the type of reputational harm that was alleged by the Councilman did not qualify as irreparable injury since any individual who was the subject of an administrative proceeding faced the possibility of reputational harm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The order was reversed. The motion for injunctive relief was denied and the cross-motion to dismiss was granted. The Clerk was directed to enter judgment in favor of the Board dismissing the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Law--Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies.--In action arising from postelection audit by defendant city campaign finance board, in which plaintiffs sought injunction restraining defendant from conducting administrative hearing regarding alleged violations of Campaign Finance Law, court erred when it found that exhaustion requirement was inapplicable because plaintiffs were seeking relief in nature of mandamus to compel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Law--Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies.--Plaintiffs, who accused defendant city campaign finance board of providing constitutionally deficient notice of alleged violations of Campaign Finance Law, did not establish exception to exhaustion requirement based on alleged violation of due process; exception is limited to situations where statute or administrative scheme itself is alleged to be unconstitutional, thus undermining legality of entire proceeding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Law--Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies.--Court erred when it found that plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury in absence of injunctive relief restraining defendant city campaign finance board from conducting hearing regarding alleged violations of Campaign Finance Law, and that therefore, exception to exhaustion requirement was applicable; potential harm to plaintiff's reputation was based on speculation, since it was within defendant's discretion whether to publicize its findings; in any event, type of reputational harm alleged did not, in that specific administrative context, qualify as irreparable injury. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Commissioner received complaints that the pubs were permitting smoking in their establishments. An inspector visited the pubs, for less than 30 minutes, observed patrons smoking but did not see the bartenders take any action to prevent or stop the individuals from smoking. Each owner testified that staff members were directed to inform patrons of the law prohibiting smoking and to request that they extinguish their cigarettes. In two of the pubs, several &quot;No Smoking&quot; signs were prominently displayed, as required by Public Health Law &sect;&nbsp;1399-p. In the third pub, there was conflicting testimony about whether the required &quot;No Smoking&quot; signs were displayed. The appellate court concluded, based on the record before it, that there was not substantial evidence to support the Commissioner's determination as to the two pubs with the necessary signs displayed. Among other things, the appellate court noted that Public Health Law &sect; 1399-o did not inform the proprietors of what affirmative steps needed to be taken to insure that smoking was not permitted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner new justice appealed a judgment by the Delaware County Supreme Court (New York) that dismissed his CPLR art. 78 application seeking to compel respondent town board to pay him a higher annual salary; the justice claimed that the board violated U.S. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, NY Const. art. VI, &sect; 25(a) in determining his salary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The voters approved a resolution by the town board to reduce the number of town justices from two to one. After the new justice was elected, but before he took office, the board set the salaries for the two town justices by raising the incumbent's salary from $ 5,000 to $ 7,500 annually and setting the justice's salary at $ 500 annually. The appellate court found that the board violated public policy and the constitutional principals of separation of powers in setting the justice's exceedingly meager salary. Although the board could approve different salary amounts for its two justices under Town Law &sect; 27(1), it had no legitimate reason to set the new justice's salary at such a low amount. As the board acted in a manner likely to affect or impinge upon the independence of the judiciary, its action in setting the new justice's salary at $ 500 per year violated the U.S. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, NY Const. art. VI, &sect; 25(a). Consequently, the trial court erred in dismissing the new justice's CPLR art. 78 application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff, property owners, sought a declaration that defendant, the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, improperly assessed a real estate transfer tax pursuant to Tax Law &sect; 1400 et seq. on certain transfers of property. The Supreme Court, Westchester County, New York, granted the Department's motion to dismiss the first two counts of the complaint while denying the owners' cross-motion for summary judgment. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The owners came into ownership of two natural gas pipelines, together with the easements in which the pipelines were located. The Department determined that the acquisition of the easements was subject to the real estate transfer tax. Because, in their first cause of action, the owners claimed that the easements did not constitute an interest in real property within the meaning of the Tax Law, the declaratory judgment action for a determination of that claim was proper. Thus, the supreme court should not have dismissed the owners' first cause of action, but should have determined the owner's cross motion for summary judgment on the merits. The cross-motion should have been denied on the merits, however, because the easements provided the owners with the right to use the property for the purpose of constructing a pipeline, and thus constituted an interest in real property for purposes of the real estate transfer tax. The owners' second cause of action involved the proper application of the real estate transfer tax statute to persons and property within the Department's jurisdiction, and thus was properly dismissed due to the owners' failure to exhaust their administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The order was modified to deny the motion to dismiss the owners' first cause of action, and the Department was granted summary judgment on that cause of action.

On appeal, the court found that the Council was authorized to enact the local laws because they were not prohibited by the New York Taylor Law, Civil Service Law &sect;&sect; 204(2) and 212. Further, the local laws were not invalid under separation of powers principles. Furthermore, because the local laws were enacted in accordance with the authority conferred by Civil Service Law &sect; 212, they were not subject to the referendum requirement of Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 23. Finally, NY City Charter &sect; 38(5) did not make the local law subject to a mandatory referendum, because state statutes provided that the local laws were not subject to a mandatory referendum.</SPAN></P>

The challenged local laws were not invalid as &quot;inconsistent&quot; with and &quot;unauthorized and prohibited&quot; by the Taylor Law. The City Council was not prohibited by the Taylor Law from exercising its constitutional and statutory authority (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Civil Service Law &sect;206 [1]; &sect; 212) to curtail the scope of the authority the Mayor previously enjoyed without otherwise impairing the Mayor's exclusive authority under the Taylor Law to bargain and negotiate over the terms and conditions of employment with employee organizations. The right to bargain and negotiate is not itself a term or condition of employment over which the Mayor's authority is exclusive under the Taylor Law. Furthermore, the Taylor Law does not authorize the Mayor or any local government not to negotiate with a union representing a group of municipal employees and thereby impose upon them terms and conditions of employment to which they have not acceded.  </SPAN></P>

Even though the subject laws curtailed the authority the Mayor previously enjoyed under the Collective Bargaining Law to negotiate and enter into collective bargaining agreements that bound the affected Fire Department employees without the participation of their respective unions, not every local law that curtails mayoral power is subject to a mandatory referendum. A local legislative body may by local law curtail a power of an elective officer if its acts &quot;under the authority of a state statute.&quot; Consequently, since the City Council was acting under its authority under the Taylor Law to enact substantive and procedural provisions governing labor relations that are &quot;substantially equivalent&quot; to the Taylor Law (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Civil Service Law &sect; 212), a referendum was not required. </SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that there was no other reasonable explanation for defendant's conduct other than a sexual motive. Therefore, the underlying unlawful imprisonment case clearly had a sexual aspect. In addition, defendant has two prior convictions for sex crimes. As a result, the record supported the hearing court's finding that defendant should be designated a level three sex offender. Consequently, &sect; 168-a(2)(a)(I) was constitutional as applied to defendant. The various mitigating factors argued by defendant were outweighed by the danger of future recidivism, and did not warrant a downward departure from the presumptive risk level.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed a judgment by the County Court of Broome County (New York) that convicted him of second-degree murder under Penal Law &sect; 125.25(2); defendant claimed that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the conviction and that the depraved indifference murder statute was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After defendant and his companion were involved in an altercation during a pool game, the companion struck at least one bar patron an aluminum bat, smashed the front picture window of the bar, and left. Defendant and his companion then obtained a shotgun from the companion's residence and returned to the bar where defendant fired a single shotgun blast through the open front door into a crowd of approximately 30 bar patrons, killing a patron seated at the bar. The appellate court found that defendant failed to preserve his argument regarding legal insufficiency of the evidence. In any event, defendant's written confession and the evidence introduced at trial provided the jury an adequate basis upon which to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was, in fact, the individual who discharged the shotgun into the bar. That action constituted the type of morally reprehensible conduct without regard to human life that established the requisite depravity under &sect; 125.25(2). The statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it clearly apprised defendant of the forbidden conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The business owner entered into contracts to perform electrical work for two municipalities, and hired two men to assist him. He paid them $15.70 per hour with no additional benefits. The Department found that the business owner violated the prevailing wage rate laws by not paying his employees journeyman electrician wages of $25 per hour plus supplemental benefits and that the underpayment was willful. The court concluded that the classification of the employees as journeymen electricians was supported by substantial evidence because they performed the same work designated for journeyman electricians under a collective bargaining agreement between the Albany Electrical Contractors Association and the local union of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Substantial evidence also supported the finding of willfulness. While the projects constituted the first time the business owner hired others on a public works project, he had previously worked on such projects and knew that the wage rates were higher. He also discussed the federal prevailing wage statutes with one employee and stated that he would not pay prevailing wages because no person deserved such a salary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court rejected defendant's contention that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the conviction of attempted murder in the first degree. The People presented evidence that defendant had the specific intent to commit murder and engaged in conduct to carry out that intent. There was evidence that showed that defendant pointed a loaded revolver at close range at the chest of a police officer who was pursuing him, but during a struggle the officer grabbed the revolver and prevented defendant from firing it. Defendant failed to preserve for the court's review his contention that a jury charge related to the weapons possession charge was misleading or confusing. Defendant also failed to preserve for review his contention that the People failed to establish his knowledge that the revolver was defaced as required for the conviction of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree under Penal Law &sect; 265.02(3). There was no dispute that defendant possessed the defaced revolver on his person and that its condition was visible as he pointed it to police in a shooter's stance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Respondent mental hygiene legal service, on behalf of an adult mentally retarded daughter, objected to the appointment by the Surrogate's Court, New York County (New York), of petitioner mother as guardian of the person of the daughter under the New York Surrogate's Court Procedure Act (NYSCPA), specifically SCPA 1750, to the extent that the guardianship extended to decisions concerning life-sustaining treatment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The daughter argued that she objected to granting her mother the power to terminate life-sustaining medical care. The appellate court held that treating the daughter differently from a competent person did not violate the Equal Protection Clause as the State had a legitimate interest in advancing the right of mentally retarded persons to be free from prolonged suffering. There was no opportunity to show that a mentally retarded person would have elected to terminate life-sustaining measures under circumstances providing no hope for recover. The NYSCPA did not offend equal protection by failing to redress the plight of all similarly situated persons who were never competent to make an informed decision. The daughter's claim that the failure of the NYSCPA to require a hearing violated her due process rights did not provide a basis for appellate review as the daughter received a hearing before the appointment of a guardian. Finally, no opinion was offered on whether the extraordinary burden standard for the withholding or withdrawal of life support was unconstitutionally vague as the daughter might never be the subject of any procedure, determination, or action under SCPA 1750-b.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The order of the trial court, which appointed the mother the guardian of the daughter's person with authority to make decisions concerning life-sustaining treatment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Incapacitated and Mentally Disabled Persons -- Guardian for Mentally Retarded and Developmentally Disabled Persons -- Health Care Decisions for Mentally Retarded Persons</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Petitioner, the mother of a &quot;moderately retarded&quot; 26-year-old daughter not currently suffering from any condition requiring medical treatment, was properly appointed, following a hearing, as guardian of her daughter's person with authority to make decisions concerning life-sustaining treatment pursuant to SCPA 1750. The statutory scheme authorizing the appointment of guardians to make health care decisions for mentally retarded persons is not violative of equal protection for treating mentally retarded persons differently from persons who were once competent. The disparate treatment of mentally retarded persons and once-competent persons with regard to the procedures for terminating life-sustaining treatment is rationally related to a legitimate government interest in advancing the right of mentally retarded persons to be free from prolonged suffering. The Equal Protection Clause only prohibits the government from treating persons differently from others who are similarly situated, and mentally retarded persons are not similarly situated to those who were once competent. Furthermore, respondent could not challenge the constitutionality of the statute on due process grounds because the statute does not require a hearing where, as here, both parents consented to the appointment of a guardian (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">SCPA 1754). Since respondent sought and received a hearing, she was not aggrieved by the order of Surrogate's Court (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPLR 5511). In addition, since respondent might never require life-sustaining measures, her challenge to the statute as being unconstitutionally vague under the &quot;extraordinary burden&quot; criterion (SCPA 1750-b [4] [b] [ii]) did not present a justiciable controversy. </SPAN></P>

Respondents, Commissioners of the New York State Board of Elections, invalidated the petition for signature deficiencies under N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 6-130 on respondent individual's objection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Board found that 259 of the 1,175 signatures on the candidate's petition were deficient, leaving the candidate with fewer than the 1,000 required signatures. In the candidate's proceeding under N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 16-102, the trial court found that the failure of signers to correctly list their town or city was a fatal defect requiring dismissal. The appellate court affirmed the judgment. The requirement for setting forth the town or city served legitimate purposes of facilitating the discovery of fraud and allowing rapid, efficient verification of signatures. Failure to include the town or city with a signature resulted in the signature's invalidation. The establishment of a statewide voter database under the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (Act), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 15483, did not change the result because states had discretion to determine the manner of compliance with the Act. Any finding that the information required by N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 6-130 was no longer necessary was to be made by the legislature and not by the courts. The town and city requirement did not restrict access to the ballot or place unconstitutional burdens on the candidate's 1st or 14th Amendment rights to associate.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that New York's sentencing scheme for persistent felony offenders violated defendant's Sixth Amendment rights.

The validity of both deficiency notices was sustained during a 2002 conciliation conference and again at a tax appeals hearing. The administration law judge (ALJ) also imposed a frivolous position penalty against petitioner. The Tribunal upheld the decisions of the ALJ. The court rejected petitioner's assertion that the Tribunal and the ALJ could not rely upon documentation from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) because under N.Y.

The statute on its face prohibited all expenditures in aid of candidates for a primary election, and as such, the statute prohibited core First Amendment activity. The court rejected the argument that a compelling state interest to protect against corruption did not justify a complete prohibition on spending.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Petitioner voters had standing to commence a proceeding seeking an order declaring that respondent political party violated Election Law &sect; 2-126 by spending party funds to aid the campaign of a particular candidate in another party's primary election for District Attorney in petitioners' county. Election Law &sect; 16-114 (3) states that &quot;any five qualified voters&quot; may commence a proceeding in Supreme Court to &quot;compel by order any person who has failed to comply ... with any of the provisions of this chapter.&quot; Therefore, petitioners, as five voters registered to vote in the political subdivision conducting the election at issue, had standing.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Academic and Moot Questions -- Election Law Challenge to Expenditure of Party Funds </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Although the proceeding brought by petitioners, five registered voters, seeking an order declaring that respondent political party violated Election Law &sect;2-126 by spending party funds to aid the campaign of a particular candidate in another party's primary election for District Attorney in petitioners' county was initiated after the primary election had concluded, thereby rendering the proceeding moot because Supreme Court could no longer compel compliance with Election Law &sect;2-126, the exception to the mootness doctrine was applicable. The issue raised was important and novel, likely to recur and, most notably, will typically evade judicial review in light of the fact that the challenged expenditures are often made immediately before the primary election, as they were here, and may not be disclosed in campaign finance records until after the primary election has concluded.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Elections -- Primary Elections -- Challenge to Expenditure of Party Funds </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Respondent political party violated Election Law &sect; 2-126 by spending party funds to aid the campaign of a particular candidate in another party's primary election for a county District Attorney. Election Law &sect; 2-126 prevents the expenditure of party funds &quot;in aid of the designation or nomination of any person to be voted for at a primary election.&quot; The statute is not directed solely at intraparty spending by party leadership on its own endorsed candidate; it also prohibits a party's use of its funds to support a candidate in a primary election of another political party, as was done here. The vast majority of the funds spent by respondent were spent prior to the primary election. Although respondent maintained that its expenditures related to only the general election, the mailings sent out by respondent prior to the primary election specifically referenced the other party's primary election instead of the general election and compared the candidate it supported only to the other party's nominee, without mentioning any other candidates running in the general election.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Elections - Primary Elections -- Challenge to Expenditure of Party Funds -- Constitutionality of Election Law &sect; 2-126 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Although respondent political party violated Election Law &sect; 2-126 by spending party funds to aid the campaign of a particular candidate in another party's primary election for a county District Attorney, Election Law &sect; 2-126, as applied here, unconstitutionally burdened respondent's First Amendment rights of political expression and association. Since the time that the statute was enacted, the case law of the United States Supreme Court regarding the First Amendment implications of legislation regulating expenditures in connection with elections has evolved significantly, and expenditures by political parties in elections are now understood to constitute &quot;core&quot; First Amendment activities entitled to substantial protection. By prohibiting all expenditures by political parties in aid of candidates to be voted for at a primary election, Election Law &sect; 2-126 prohibits &quot;core&quot; First Amendment activity. Regulations that impact a political party's capacity to communicate with the public will not survive constitutional scrutiny unless they are narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. Here, the state's interest in avoiding corruption and the appearance thereof in electoral politics was not a sufficiently compelling interest, standing alone, to support expenditure limits. Nor did the unsupported assertions that permitting a political party to spend money in communicating with the public regarding candidates running in primary elections will lead to interparty manipulation and the control of the primary process by party machines constitute a sufficiently compelling state interest. </SPAN></P>

The court held that respondents satisfied their obligations under the New York State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA), N.Y. Envtl. Conserv.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondents' determination and findings approving the acquisition by condemnation of petitioners' real property and/or easements thereto in furtherance of a proposed subway extension/rezoning and redevelopment project in Midtown Manhattan were confirmed in consolidated proceedings pursuant to EDPL 207 as being in compliance with the substantive requirements of the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA). Respondents satisfied their obligations under SEQRA by taking a &quot;hard look&quot; at the anticipated areas of environmental concern of the proposed project and making a &quot;reasoned elaboration&quot; of the basis for their determination. During the extensive review process, the lead agencies held scoping sessions, accepted both the draft and final generic environmental impact statements and reviewed input from the community and experts. The elimination of a proposed multiuse stadium and convention center expansion from the project did not render respondents' reliance on the final environmental impact statement improper. </SPAN></P>

The statute only requires that the approximate location and the reasons for the location selection for the proposed project be set forth.

In New York, the term &quot;public use&quot; broadly encompasses any use, including urban renewal, which contributes to the health, safety and general welfare of the public. Judicial review is limited to ascertaining whether the proposed project is rationally related to a conceivable public purpose. Moreover, the fact that a private party might benefit from the condemnation of property to be used for a public purpose is an insufficient basis to reject a condemnation. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The offenders argued that they should have been committed under the New York Correction Law. The appellate court held that the Correction Law was inapplicable as two offenders' applications were submitted on the date of their release and there was no possibility that the other offenders would be returned to the custody of the New York Department of Correctional Services (DOCS). Further, a few hours or days remaining in the sentence when the application was filed did not render offenders &quot;persons serving a sentence of imprisonment.&quot; The New York Mental Hygiene Law applied as each offender was committed on the date of his release from prison. Under both the New York Mental Hygiene Law and the New York Correction Law, retention was properly sought under N.Y. Mental. Hyg. Law art. 9. DOCS had standing to make the applications. Article 9 did not deprive the offenders of their due process rights. It was error to file the habeas proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 70 as N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 33.15 was the more specific habeas provision.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioners, convicted sex offenders who were certified as being dangerously mentally ill by two Office of Mental Health (OMH) physicians immediately prior to their scheduled release from prison, were not entitled to a precommitment hearing pursuant to Correction Law &sect; 402 before their transfers to an OMH psychiatric facility for involuntary commitment at the conclusion of their prison terms upon the required certification of a third physician in accordance with Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 9.27. The procedures of Correction Law &sect; 402 for mentally ill inmates did not govern petitioners' commitment, since petitioners were no longer prisoners at the time of their commitment. The Mental Hygiene Law commitment procedures control where a hospitalized inmate no longer serving a sentence becomes a free individual (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Correction Law &sect; 404 [1]). The Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) had standing to make the applications for petitioners' involuntary commitment as &quot;an officer of any public or well recognized charitable institution or agency or home in whose institution the person alleged to be mentally ill resides&quot; (Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 9.27 [b] [4]). As used in the statute, the word &quot;public&quot; has an independent meaning, modifying institution, agency and home, and DOCS thus qualified as a &quot;public&quot; agency. Finally, while Supreme Court properly determined that the habeas corpus petition should have been brought pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 33.15, it erred by conditionally releasing petitioners without conducting its own review as to the state of each individual's mental disability. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), convicting him, after a nonjury trial, of attempted assault in the second degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, criminal mischief in the third degree, assault in the third degree (three counts), endangering the welfare of a child (three counts), and aggravated cruelty to animals, and imposing sentence as a second violent felony offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant claimed his &quot;stomping&quot; on a pet goldfish was a misdemeanor (N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 353) and not a felony under N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 353-a(1) because a fish was not a &quot;companion animal&quot; and his actions did not constitute aggravated cruelty. The appeals court found the Legislature did not require a reciprocity of affection in the definition of &quot;companion animal.&quot; The statute's language was consistent with the People's claim that &quot;domesticated&quot; was commonly understood to mean &quot;to adapt (an animal or plant) to life in intimate association with and to the advantage of humans.&quot; Thus, a goldfish was a domesticated rather than a wild animal under the common meaning. Section 353-a was sufficiently clear to apprise a person of ordinary intelligence that the sort of conduct in which defendant engaged came within its prohibition. The trial court improperly exercised discretion in considering attempted assault in the second degree as a lesser-included offense of first-degree attempted assault. It was not until after summations that the court indicated it would consider attempted second-degree assault, a significant departure from the prosecution's theory of the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment was modified, on the law, to the extent of vacating the conviction for attempted assault in the second degree, and replacing the second violent felony offender adjudication with a second felony offender adjudication, reducing the aggregate sentence to 5 1/2 to 11 years, and otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Aggravated Cruelty to Animals -- Stomping of &quot;Pet&quot; Goldfish </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was lawfully convicted of the felony of aggravated cruelty to animals (Agriculture and Markets Law &sect; 353-a [1]) for having stomped to death three &quot;pet&quot; goldfish kept by his girlfriend's nine-year-old son following an altercation with his girlfriend in the apartment they shared. The statute, which proscribes intentionally killing or intentionally causing &quot;serious physical injury to a companion animal with aggravated cruelty,&quot; is not unconstitutionally vague. A &quot;companion animal,&quot; in addition to any dog or cat, includes &quot;any other domesticated animal normally maintained in or near the household of the owner or person who cares&quot; for the animal (Agriculture and Markets Law &sect; 350 [5]). A &quot;pet&quot; goldfish is a &quot;domesticated animal&quot; that falls within the statutory definition of &quot;companion animal,&quot; and defendant's &quot;stomping&quot; constituted &quot;aggravated cruelty&quot; within the meaning of the statute. The statute is sufficiently clear to apprise a person of ordinary intelligence that the sort of conduct in which the defendant engaged comes within its prohibition.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Lesser Included Offense -- Attempted Second Degree Assault </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In defendant's prosecution for assault and related charges arising from an altercation with his girlfriend in the apartment they shared, the trial court in the bench trial improperly exercised its discretion pursuant to CPL 300.50 in considering, sua sponte, the charge of attempted assault in the second degree as a lesser included offense of first degree assault and finding defendant guilty of that charge based upon defendant's use of his hand to injure his girlfriend during the altercation. The prosecution tried its case on the theory that defendant's use of a knife in the struggle against his girlfriend established the necessary element of attempt to cause serious physical injury. The court's consideration of attempted assault in the second degree without the use of a weapon as a lesser included offense represented a significant departure from the prosecution's case against defendant, requiring a reversal of the conviction. When the People have limited the theory of the prosecution, the court is obliged to observe that limitation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Criminal Mischief -- Proof of Amount of Damage to Property -- Photographic Evidence</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant was properly convicted of criminal mischief in the third degree (Penal Law &sect; 145.05 [2]) for damaging his girlfriend's property in the apartment they shared in an amount exceeding $ 250, even though there was no expert testimony or documentation as to repair costs. The photographic evidence of the damage to the television screen and a glass wall unit, coupled with complainant's testimony as to what she paid for those items and her claim that the repair cost would be $ 500 for the wall unit and $ 700 for the television, were sufficient to establish repair cost in excess of $ 250 beyond a reasonable doubt.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Second Violent Felony Offender</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Although defendant's adjudication as a second violent felony offender was necessarily vacated because he was not convicted of any violent felony in this case, there was no need for resentencing since the sentences imposed were all lawful for a nonviolent second felony offender and the trial court stated its intention to sentence defendant to the maximum possible term. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendants, the State of New York and others, appealed the order of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), granting plaintiffs' motion to confirm the referees' report, denying the cross motion of the State and other defendants to reject the report in part, and directing the State and others to implement a plan to provide the New York City School District with a minimum amount of additional annual operating and capital improvement funds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In previous litigation in the instant case, the state high court found that schoolchildren in the New York City School District were not receiving the opportunity for the constitutional sound basic education as required under N.Y. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1 and that there was a causal link between the state's funding system and the constitutional failure. The New York State Governor and Legislature were unable to agree on an amount of funding required to remedy the constitutional failure. At a hearing before referees appointed by the trial court, the State and other defendants submitted a plan that proposed $ 4.7 billion in additional funds for the District. The referees recommended additional annual funds of $ 5.63 billion and capital improvements of $ 9.179 billion. The separation of powers doctrine made it erroneous for the trial court to adopt the referees' recommendations. Under N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect;&sect; 1-7, budgeting was for the Governor and Legislature. Furthermore, N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1 required the Legislature to provide for the maintenance of the public education system. Lastly, the courts were ill equipped to determine the appropriate amount of funding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The order was modified insofar as the confirmation of the referees' report was vacated and the New York State Governor and Legislature were directed, in part, in enacting a budget, to consider an amount in between $ 4.7 billion and $ 5.63 billion for annual operating funds and that they implement a capital improvement plan of $ 9.179 billion over five years or otherwise meet the District's capital needs. The order was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- State Aid to School Districts -- Remedy for Failure to Provide &quot;Sound Basic Education&quot; -- Separation of Powers Doctrine </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supreme Court, in implementing the directive of the Court of Appeals that the State reform the current system of school funding for the New York City public school system to ensure that the City's schoolchildren receive a &quot;sound basic education&quot; as required by the Education Article of the State Constitution (NY Const, art XI, &sect; 1), erred in confirming the report of the Referees and directing that the State appropriate at least $ 5.63 billion in additional annual operating funds for the 2006 fiscal year. Although the State can be directed to appropriate the necessary funding to meet its educational mandate, it is for the Governor and the Legislature, not the courts, to adopt a dollar-specific budget. Under the separation of powers doctrine, the courts cannot usurp the budgetary and educational powers of the Governor and the Legislature and substitute their own budgetary calculations for those of the other branches. The record established that a range of between $ 4.7 billion and $ 5.63 billion phased in over four years would satisfy the State's constitutional education funding obligations, and respondents were directed to consider a funding plan within that range in enacting a budget. Supreme Court did not, however, err in confirming the Referees' recommendation that the State expend a minimum of $ 9.179 billion on capital improvements over the next five years in view of the State's failure to refute or offer an alternative to plaintiffs' proposed capital improvement plan that was adopted by the Referees. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant placed a video camera in the bedroom of his girlfriend's 12-year-old daughter in order to record the girl undressing. He was indicted on five counts, and as part of an agreement, he entered a guilty plea to one count of unlawful surveillance. The trial court sentenced defendant as an admitted second felony offender to a term of imprisonment. On appeal, the court initially noted that defendant did not effect a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of his right to appeal as part of his agreement, as there was no mention of the waiver during the plea recitation. However, his claims lacked merit. His challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 250.45(3) was not preserved and the court declined to review it in the interest of justice. Defendant also failed to preserve the issue as to the sufficiency of his plea allocution. However, the colloquy unequivocally established that defendant had intentionally used or installed the video camera in the victim's bedroom without her knowledge or consent, and that he was guilty as charged. The allocution was not fatally deficient, as defendant was not required to expressly admit that he had &quot;no legitimate purpose&quot; for his conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff same-sex couples challenged an order of the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), which dismissed their complaint seeking a judgment declaring the New York Domestic Relations Law unconstitutional to the extent that it prohibited marriage licenses from being issued to same-sex couples. Plaintiffs had requested marriage licenses under N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 15 and were informed that such licenses would not be issued to same-sex couples.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs asserted that the restriction violated the due process, equal protection, and free speech provisions of the state constitution. The court found that the case was not simply about the right to marry the person of one's choice, but represented a significant expansion into new territory which was, in reality, a redefinition of marriage. The court was not persuaded that plaintiffs had established beyond a reasonable doubt that it was irrational for the legislature to preserve the historic legal and cultural understanding of marriage. The court was also unpersuaded by plaintiffs' argument that the relevant restrictions placed by New York on the issuing of marriage licenses violated their constitutional right to free speech; the state's laws defining marriage were general in nature and did not target any speech or expressive conduct. The legislature acted consistent with its constitutional role, and the parameters that it placed on marriage were undergirded by sufficient governmental interests to uphold marriage as historically understood and defined. The court concluded that the legislature was where changes to marriage of the nature urged by plaintiffs should be addressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Marriage -- Same Sex Marriage -- Constitutionality of Marriage Laws </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. New York's marriage laws are not unconstitutional to the extent that they prohibit marriage licenses from being issued to same-sex couples (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Domestic Relations Law &sect; 15). Substantive due process under the State Constitution (NY Const, art I, &sect; 6) is not violated by limiting marriage to heterosexual couples. While traditional marriage is a fundamental right, that right does not encompass same-sex marriages. Furthermore, New York's marriage laws are not violative of equal protection under the rational basis standard. The otherwise facially neutral marriage laws do not create an unconstitutional gender-based discriminatory scheme. Rather, permitting only opposite-sex couples to marry is rationally based on the State's legitimate interest in preserving the historic legal and cultural understanding of heterosexual marriage as a social institution in which procreation occurs. Any changes to the marriage laws require legislative action, and cannot be accomplished by a judicial redefinition of marriage to include same-sex couples. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Marriage -- Same Sex Marriage -- Constitutionality of Marriage Laws </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. New York's marriage laws prohibiting marriage licenses from being issued to same-sex couples do not violate plaintiffs' constitutional right to free speech. Even if it is assumed that the Legislature's actions in fulfilling its long-established duty of defining the parameters of marriage implicated plaintiffs' free speech rights, when speech and nonspeech elements are combined a sufficiently important governmental interest in regulating the nonspeech element can justify incidental limitations on First Amendment freedoms. The State's laws defining marriage are general in nature and do not target any speech or expressive conduct. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff owners appealed a judgment by the Nassau County Supreme Court (New York) that granted defendant village's motion for summary judgment in the owners' action to declare that a village law was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The owners lived in a home that was constructed as part of a six-home subdivision on a cul-de-sac. The newer section of the cul-de-sac was divided from the older section by the presence of stone pillars on each side of the road at the entrance of the cul-de-sac. A homeowners association that represented the newer, northern section of the cul-de-sac petitioned the village to ban all on-street parking on that section of the street due to numerous complaints that the owners habitually parked their vehicles near the stone pillars. The appellate court found that the village's decision to ban parking in the northern section of the cul-de-sac had a rational basis, to wit: to ensure emergency and service vehicles access and maneuverability and unobstructed views when exiting and entering driveways. The southern section of the cul-de-sac did not necessarily have the same issues. Consequently, because the parking ban was not unconstitutional, the trial court did not err in granting the village's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment was modified by adding a provision declaring that the local law was constitutional; as so modified, the grant of summary judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed a judgment on jury verdict of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), convicting him of third-degree robbery and sentencing him as a persistent felony offender, and also appealed an order of the same court that denied his N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant had a long history, over decades, of committing violent acts in the course of snatching purses from, primarily, elderly women victims. The incident giving rise to his robbery prosecution had occurred shortly after his release from a previous long incarceration. The evidence indicated that he blocked the victim's exit while demanding money from her and threatening her with a bottle. This was sufficient to supply the &quot;force&quot; element needed to prove third-degree robbery, even though the jury had not found that the bottle was a &quot;dangerous instrumentality&quot; so as to prove first-degree robbery. While defendant's appeal was pending, the state's highest court had determined that the practice, used in defendant's case, of having a judge decide whether persistent felony offender sentencing was appropriate, based on facts originally found by the jury, did not violation constitutional safeguards. For this reason, and because the record showed that the public could best be protected by imposition of a long sentence, relief from that sentence was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Sentence--Persistent Felony Offender.--Defendant's sentence as persistent felony offender after conviction of third degree robbery was not disturbed given his lengthy and serious criminal record which included many violent acts against women; court carefully considered defendant's troubled childhood, his drug addiction and his affliction with AIDS. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The employers' constitutional challenges to the Women's Health and Wellness Act (Act) all fell within the religion clauses of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. Within the Act, the legislature provided an exemption from the contraceptive coverage mandate which generally included religious institutions in their capacity as ecclesiastical bodies, but which might not include religious institutions in their capacity as ministries. The contraceptive coverage mandate burdened the employers' right to freely exercise their religious beliefs. However, despite this burden, the Act did not offend the constitutional or statutory provisions the employers invoked. Moreover, while an exemption could give rise to entanglement problems if a court or agency were asked to determine what types of religious activity constituted the inculcation of religious values, such an inquiry was not presented in light of the employers' concessions that their primary focus was not the inculcation of religious values. To the extent that any of the arguments asserted by the employers were not explicitly addressed, they were considered and found to be lacking in merit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Religion -- Contraception Coverage Mandate -- &quot;Religious Employer&quot; Exemption </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Women's Health and Wellness Act (WHWA) (L 2002, ch 554), which requires employers that provide group insurance coverage for prescriptions to include prescription contraceptives in that coverage, is not unconstitutional to the extent that the &quot;religious employer&quot; exemption from the contraceptive coverage for religious institutions in their capacity as ecclesiastical bodies (Insurance Law &sect; 3221 [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">l</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] [16] [A]; &sect; 4303 [cc] [1]) does not extend to faith-based entities like plaintiffs that operate ministries in areas of human service whose primary purpose is not the inculcation of religious values. The incidental burdens imposed by the WHWA's contraceptive coverage mandate upon plaintiffs' sincerely held religious beliefs do not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The WHWA is facially neutral and its object, to increase women's access to health care, does not target religious practices. Furthermore, the Free Exercise Clause of the State Constitution (NY Const, art I, &sect; 3) does not afford plaintiffs any greater protection. The State's important conjoined interests in gender equity and health care addressed in the WHWA outweigh plaintiffs' free exercise rights. Moreover, plaintiffs failed to rebut the presumption that the Legislature conducted adequate fact-finding to support its enactment of the WHWA. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Contraception Coverage Mandate -- &quot;Religious Employer&quot; Exemption </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Women's Health and Wellness Act (L 2002, ch 554), which requires employers that provide group insurance coverage for prescriptions to include prescription contraceptives in that coverage, is not unconstitutional under the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause to the extent that the &quot;religious employer&quot; exemption from the contraceptive coverage for religious institutions in their capacity as ecclesiastical bodies (Insurance Law &sect; 3221 [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">l</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] [16] [A]; &sect; 4303 [cc] [1]) does not extend to faith-based entities like plaintiffs that operate ministries in areas of human service whose primary purpose is not the inculcation of religious values. Plaintiffs failed to state a &quot;hybrid&quot; constitutional claim deriving from the rights of expressive association and conduct as speech. The provision of group health insurance coverage for prescription contraceptives is not constitutionally protected expressive conduct. Consequently, the statute cannot be deemed to compel plaintiffs to communicate a particularized message endorsing contraceptive use that is contrary to their sincerely held religious beliefs.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Establishment of Religion -- Contraception Coverage Mandate -- &quot;Religious Employer&quot; Exemption </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Women's Health and Wellness Act (L 2002, ch 554), which requires employers that provide group insurance coverage for prescriptions to include prescription contraceptives in that coverage, is not violative of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the extent that the &quot;religious employer&quot; exemption from the contraceptive coverage for religious institutions in their capacity as ecclesiastical bodies (Insurance Law &sect; 3221 [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">l</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] [16] [A]; &sect; 4303 [cc] [1]) does not extend to faith-based entities like plaintiffs that operate ministries in areas of human service whose primary purpose is not the inculcation of religious values. The exemption's distinction between religious and secular activities does not constitute a prohibited gerrymander, since it does not distinguish between religions or sects. The statute on its face does not give rise to excessive entanglement between church and state. Furthermore, the contraception coverage mandate does not impermissibly interfere with &quot;church autonomy.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Rights -- Discrimination in Employment -- Contraception Coverage Mandate -- &quot;Religious Employer&quot; Exemption </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Women's Health and Wellness Act (L 2002, ch 554), which requires employers that provide group insurance coverage for prescriptions to include prescription contraceptives in that coverage, is not invalid for being contrary to the Human Rights Law to the extent that the &quot;religious employer&quot; exemption from the contraceptive coverage for religious institutions in their capacity as ecclesiastical bodies (Insurance Law &sect; 3221 [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">l</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] [16] [A]; &sect; 4303 [cc] [1]) does not extend to faith-based entities like plaintiffs that operate ministries in areas of human service whose primary purpose is not the inculcation of religious values. The doctrine of preemption does not apply to conflicts between two provisions of state law. In any event, the Human Rights Law exemption for religious-related employers (Executive Law &sect; 296 [11]) merely excuses such employers from compliance with Executive Law &sect; 296 and does not otherwise restrict the power of the Legislature to otherwise impose affirmative requirements upon religious-related employers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Establishment of Religion -- Contraception Coverage Mandate</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In an action challenging the constitutionality of the Women's Health and Wellness Act (WHWA) (L 2002, ch 554) insofar as it requires employers that provide group insurance coverage for prescriptions to include prescription contraceptive coverage, to the extent that plaintiffs are religious corporations, their argument that certain provisions of the Religious Corporations Law explicitly subordinated the WHWA to the governance of religious denominations, thus barring the Legislature from imposing the contraceptive coverage mandate upon them, lacks merit. There is nothing in the provisions cited by plaintiffs that would insulate them from a generally applicable law such as the WHWA. </SPAN></P>

Executive Law &sect; 632-a, (Son of Sam Law), plaintiff crime victim sued defendant inmate, seeking to reach proceeds of the inmate's medical malpractice settlement. The inmate moved to dismiss the complaint on grounds that &sect; 632-a was unconstitutional; the Westchester County Supreme Court (New York) denied the motion. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The victim, a transit police officer, was shot with his own revolver by the inmate. While incarcerated for his crimes, the inmate settled a medical malpractice action brought against the State of New York. Learning of the settlement, the victim filed the instant suit. The inmate argued that the Son of Sam Law violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 9, by affording crime victims new rights to sue that did not exist at the time of his conviction, and violated the Contracts Clause, U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10, by impairing an existing contract between himself and the State. The appellate court disagreed. The Son of Sam Law did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause because it was a civil law that was not punitive in intent or affect, it advanced the State's compelling interest in ensuring that crime victims were compensated by the perpetrators, and it was rationally connected to that objective. Nor did it violate the Contracts Clause, as it did not operate upon the contract itself, but only against the property that was the subject of the stipulation settling the inmate's malpractice claim. The law merely exposed that malpractice recovery to the victim.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff, a New York City Transit Authority police officer who was severely injured in a line-of-duty shooting by defendant in 1974, stated a claim under the Son of Sam Law (Executive Law &sect; 632-a) against the medical malpractice settlement received by defendant from the State in 2001 during his incarceration. The Son of Sam Law, which permits a crime victim to recover damages from the convicted perpetrator of the crime, does not unconstitutionally impose further punishment upon convicted criminals in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 9 [3]). The statute was intended to provide the opportunity for restitution to crime victims, not to impose additional punishment upon convicted criminals. Furthermore, the statute is not punitive in effect. The statute does not impose any affirmative disabilities or restraints upon a convicted criminal, nor does the statute serve a retributive or deterrent effect. Rather, the statute merely enables a crime victim to pursue compensation for an injury, a remedy that has not historically been regarded as punishment.  </SPAN></P>

The law does not operate upon the contract (the stipulation between defendant and the State settling his malpractice claim) itself, but only against the property that was the subject of the stipulation, and therefore does not impair the performance of the contract (where the contract was performed by depositing the money in the inmate's account), but merely exposes the malpractice recovery to plaintiff. In any event, if there were an impairment, it was to accomplish the legitimate public purpose of the recompense of crime victims. </SPAN></P>

The definition of marriage in the DRL expressed an important, long-recognized public policy supporting, among other things, procreation, child welfare, and social stability--all legitimate state interests. The motion court's revision of statutory language impermissibly replaced the legislative intent with that of the court. The DRL provisions regarding marriage did not violate the due process and equal protection provisions of N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 6, 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The grant of summary judgment was vacated, the same sex couples' motion for summary judgment was denied, the city clerk's cross-motion for summary judgment was granted, and a declaration was issued that the relevant sections of the Domestic Relations Law were constitutional and valid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York's marriage laws (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Domestic Relations Law &sect;&sect; 10, 12, 15 [1] [a]) are not unconstitutional to the extent that they do not permit same-sex marriages and do not violate the due process and equal protection provisions of the New York State Constitution. Supreme Court thus erred in declaring the statutory scheme unconstitutional and creating a new constitutional right to same-sex marriage, thereby impermissibly intruding upon the legislative domain. The power to regulate marriage and make policy decisions as to which type of family unit works best for society lies with the Legislature, not the judiciary. Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the reservation of marriage to heterosexual couples violates their rights to due process and equal protection. New York's marriage laws are rationally related to the legitimate state interest in fostering traditional heterosexual marriage as the social institution that best forges a linkage between sex, procreation and child rearing. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant, an Indian Tribe, sought review of an order from the Family Court, New York County (New York), which adopted the &quot;existing Indian family&quot; (EIF) exception to the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1901 et seq., and then denied the Tribe's motion to intervene in an adoption proceeding. The family court directed the adoption in favor of respondent adoptive parents to proceed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The child's mother was a member of the Tribe, and she and the father executed consents in Arizona for termination of their parental rights and to adoption by the qualified adoptive parents. The Tribe sought to intervene in the adoption proceeding. The family court denied intervention under the Act and adopted the judicially created EIF exception, based on its finding that the child was not part of an EIF. The family court determined that the EIF exception was necessary in order to uphold the constitutionality of the Act where the child and his family lacked significant ties to a particular tribe. On appeal, the court held that the EIF exception was in direct conflict with the express language and purpose of the Act, as well as the rationale of the U.S. Supreme Court's judicial precedent. Accordingly, it declined to accept that exception as the law in New York. The court also held that although the Act was generally applicable to the proceeding, intervention by the Tribe was not expressly authorized in adoption proceedings as a matter of right under 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1911(c). However, due to the Tribe's significant interest, permission to intervene was proper under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 1013.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the order of the family court by holding that the EIF exception was not the applicable law of New York, and it granted the Tribe's motion to intervene in the proceeding. The matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Private Placement Adoption -- Adoption of &quot;Indian Child&quot; -- Applicability of Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978--Rejection of &quot;Existing Indian Family&quot; Exception </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA) (25 USC &sect; 1901 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) generally applied to a private placement adoption proceeding involving an &quot;Indian child&quot; born of a one-half Native American Indian mother and a non-Indian father, irrespective of whether the child or his parents had significant connections to his mother's tribe. Family Court, in declining to apply the ICWA and rejecting the tribe's motion to intervene as a matter of right, erred in adopting the judicially created &quot;existing Indian family&quot; (EIF) exception to the ICWA. That exception precludes application of the ICWA when an Indian child is not being removed from an existing Indian family or environment. Acceptance of the EIF exception would be fundamentally inconsistent with both the plain language of the ICWA (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;25 USC &sect; 1903 [1]), and its goal of preserving and protecting the interests of Indian tribes in their children. Furthermore, application of the ICWA without the EIF exception abridges no fundamental constitutional right, especially in view of the statutory &quot;good cause&quot; exception (25 USC &sect; 1915) that provides state courts with the flexibility to deviate from the statute's placement preferences in circumstances where the interests of the parent or child outweigh the tribe's interest in the strict application of those preferences.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Intervention -- Right of Indian Tribe to Intervene in Adoption Proceeding Involving &quot;Indian Child&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA) (25 USC &sect; 1901 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) applied to a private placement adoption proceeding involving an &quot;Indian child&quot; born of a one-half Native American Indian mother and a non-Indian father, irrespective of whether the child or his parents had significant connections to his mother's tribe, the statute did not afford the tribe standing to intervene in the proceeding as a matter of right. The ICWA expressly permits tribal intervention in foster care placement and of termination of parental rights proceedings, but does not similarly authorize tribal intervention in adoption and preadoptive placement proceedings (25 USC &sect; 1911 [c]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Intervention -- Right of Indian Tribe to Intervene in Adoption Proceeding Involving &quot;Indian Child&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Although an Indian tribe was not entitled to intervene as of right in an adoption proceeding involving an &quot;Indian child&quot; under the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA) (25 USC &sect; 1901 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), Family Court erred in denying the tribe's motion to intervene pursuant to CPLR 1013. The tribe should have been permitted to intervene pursuant to CPLR 1013 since it had a valid interest in presenting its placement preferences (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;25 USC &sect; 1915 [a]), and otherwise assuring that the adoption proceeding was conducted in accordance with the ICWA.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Private Placement Adoption -- Adoption of &quot;Indian Child&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a private placement adoption proceeding involving an &quot;Indian child&quot;, Family Court's error in applying an &quot;existing Indian family&quot; (EIF) exception to the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA) (25 USC &sect; 1901</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) to deny intervention could not be considered harmless where the tribe was permitted to intervene only for the limited purpose of the EIF hearing. Application of the ICWA would not have been &quot;useless&quot; merely because the mother threatened to revoke her consent and retain custody if the adoption by the prospective adoptive parents failed, since a parent might ultimately change his or her mind and since application of ICWA protects the important interests of the child and tribe during pendency of the proceeding. </SPAN></P>

The appeals court disagreed. The jury was entitled to discredit defendant's testimony that intruders entered his home and shot the victim, who was defendant's close friend, particularly in view of the fact that defendant admitted to the police that he owned the gun used in the shooting. Defendant further contended that the Supreme Court erred in failing to charge manslaughter in the second degree as a lesser included offense of murder in the second degree, but defendant failed to preserve his contention for review. The appeals court agreed with defendant that the trial court erred in permitting the People to impeach their own witness on redirect examination of that witness. However, that error was harmless. The trial court did not err in refusing to suppress statements defendant made to the police before receiving his Miranda warnings.

C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceedings in the Supreme Court, Ulster County (New York), to enjoin appellants, the village mayor and two village marriage officers, from solemnizing marriages without duly issued marriage licenses. The trial court denied the mayor's motion to dismiss one proceeding, issued a temporary restraining order in one proceeding, and granted the applications.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">When same-sex couples requested marriage licenses from the town clerk, under N.Y. Dom. Rel.

The mayor then drafted his own affidavit of marriage and contract of marriage, and used those documents instead of duly issued licenses to solemnize the couples' marriages in a ceremony. The mayor also had the marriage officers appointed to solemnize same-sex marriages. The resident asserted that the mayor and the marriage officers could not violate the New York Domestic Relations Law and legally marry a couple without a license duly issued by the town clerk. On appeal, the court found that (1) the mayor, under N.Y.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing -- Enjoining Performance of Same Sex Marriages -- Public Significance of Local Official's Actions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner had standing, as a village resident and a member of the village's Board of Trustees, to maintain CPLR article 78 proceedings seeking to permanently enjoin respondent Mayor or any designated marriage officer from performing unlicensed marriages. Respondent, after determining that he was &quot;constitutionally prohibited&quot; from refusing to solemnize same-sex marriages, drafted his own set of documents for licensing marriages. Petitioner had standing to seek preventive relief in view of the public significance of respondent's unprecedented action, and the fact that respondent's conduct was &quot;in contravention of a clear mandate of law&quot; that a marriage be performed only where a marriage license has been issued (Domestic Relations Law &sect; 17). The controlling statutes afford a local official no discretion in determining whether a marriage license should be issued or in solemnizing a marriage in which no valid license has been issued. Rather, the law unequivocally provides that it is unlawful to knowingly solemnize a marriage where no proper license has been issued.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Marriage -- Same Sex Marriage -- Village Mayor's Improper Solemnization of Same Sex Marriages</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent Mayor was permanently enjoined from performing same-sex marriages. Respondent clearly exceeded his role as a village mayor and violated the separation of powers doctrine by determining that he was &quot;constitutionally prohibited&quot; from refusing to solemnize same-sex marriages and then drafting his own set of documents for licensing marriages. The controlling statutes (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Domestic Relations Law &sect;&sect; 13-15, 17) afford a local official no discretion in determining whether a marriage license should be issued or in solemnizing a marriage in which no valid license has been issued. Moreover, respondent's acts did not fall within the scope of his constitutional oath of office (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art XIII, &sect; 1). A local official generally does not have the authority to refuse to comply with a ministerial duty imposed by statute on the basis of the official's opinion that the statute is unconstitutional.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant hospital appealed an order of the Supreme Court, Nassau County (New York), which denied that the hospital's motion to dismiss a wrongful death suit filed by plaintiff same-sex partner, and granted the partner's cross-motion for summary judgment as to his standing to recover damages for wrongful death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The partner argued that he and the decedent had entered into a civil union in Vermont and that precluding same-sex spouses as potential wrongful death distributees violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the federal and state constitutions. The appellate court held that the partner failed to show that the denial of wrongful death benefits to same-sex couples did not serve a legitimate governmental purpose. Confining marriage and all laws pertaining to the marital relationship to heterosexual couples did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of either the federal or state constitutions. The fact that since the perfection of the appeal, Massachusetts had judicially created such a right for its citizens was of no moment since the partner and the decedent were married in Vermont. Neither Vermont nor the couple equated civil union relationships with heterosexual marriage. The decedent did not state that he was married when he entered the hospital. Moreover, the partner did not state that he was married in the probate papers. The Full Faith and Credit and comity theories did not apply. Only the legislature was empowered to act on the issue of same-sex marriages.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Death -- Wrongful Death -- Standing of Same-Sex Life Partner to Maintain Wrongful Death Action</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff, the same-sex life partner of decedent pursuant to a civil union formalized under the laws of Vermont, lacked standing to maintain an action to recover damages for decedent's wrongful death. Under New York law, plaintiff was not a &quot;surviving spouse&quot; entitled to maintain a wrongful death action. Plaintiff failed to establish that application of the wrongful death statute (EPTL 5-4.1) in such a manner as to preclude same-sex spouses as potential distributees is violative of equal protection. Plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the denial of wrongful death benefits to same-sex couples serves no legitimate governmental purpose. Judicial precedent has established that confining marriage and all laws pertaining either directly or indirectly to the marital relationship to different sex couples is not violative of equal protection under either the state or federal constitutions. Furthermore, the theories of full faith and credit and comity were inapplicable to grant plaintiff standing to maintain the wrongful death action. Vermont law, although affording same-sex couples in a civil union relationship the same rights as those afforded married couples, did not equate civil union relationships with traditional heterosexual marriage, and thus did not alter traditional concepts of marriage. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The applicant was denied a pistol permit on the ground that the revocation of his prior pistol permit posed an automatic bar to reissuance pursuant to N.Y.

Since the applicant sought a declaration on the constitutionality of the statute, the court converted the proceeding into a declaratory judgment action under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 103(c). As to the statute, the court found that as long as the applicant had an opportunity for a hearing on the prior revocation, the statute did not violate due process. Moreover, the State had a legitimate governmental interest in preventing an applicant whose previous permit was revoked from receiving a new one and the statute bore a rational relationship to that legitimate governmental interest.</SPAN></P>

Tax Law &sect; 1202-u and Warren County, N.Y., Local Law 4, sought review of a judgment from the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), which, inter alia, converted the proprietors' application into an action for a declaratory judgment (DJ), and thereafter dismissed causes of action. The action was brought against defendant county board of supervisors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The board made a municipal home rule request for enactment of a state law, authorizing a tax on the rental proceeds of hotel and motel rooms. In response, the state legislature passed &sect; 1202-u, and the county enacted Warren County, N.Y., Local Law 4, which imposed such tax. The proprietors brought an action under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 which challenged the constitutionality of the enabling and the local legislation. The board sought dismissal and the proprietors sought a preliminary injunction to prohibit imposition of the tax. The trial court converted the matter into a DJ action, struck a provision in the local law, and dismissed the remainder of the matter. On appeal, the court found that the payment of the tax due or an undertaking in order to seek judicial review did not render the local law unconstitutional, the Ex Post Facto Clause was inapplicable, and the Contracts Clause of U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10 was not violated. Further, there was no violation of the dormant Commerce Clause, nor of the due process clause or the equal protection clause, based on the similar treatment to in-state and out-of-state tourists.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Taxation--Hotel and Motel Occupancy Tax--Judicial Review--Condition Precedent.--In action challenging local law imposing hotel and motel occupancy tax, provisions of local law requiring undertaking or payment of tax due as condition precedent to judicial review were constitutional. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statutes--Repeal by Implication--Hotel and Motel Occupancy Tax.--There was no evidence that Legislature, by enacting law authorizing occupancy tax for one county, intended to repeal identical authorization for another county and each of laws could be given effect without conflicting with one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law--Ex Post Facto Law--Hotel and Motel Occupancy Tax.--Contention that local law imposing hotel and motel occupancy tax could be retroactively applied in contravention of Ex Post Facto Clause of US Constitution was rejected--Ex Post Facto Clause prohibits legislation that makes criminal act not criminal when committed or increases punishment for previously committed offenses and, thus, had no applicability to legislation at issue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law--Contract Clause--Hotel and Motel Occupancy Tax.--Local law imposing hotel and motel occupancy tax did not impair obligation of contracts within meaning of Contract Clause of US Constitution (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> US Const, art I, &sect; 10)--Contract Clause does not prevent enactment of legislation that is reasonably necessary to further important public purpose even where such legislation may incidentally affect existing contractual obligations--purpose of legislation was to provide funds for promotion of tourism in county, recognizable public interest benefitting all of citizens of county. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties--Standing.--Plaintiffs lacked standing to assert claim that local law imposing hotel and motel occupancy tax was void for failure to exempt Indian tribes from its coverage in violation of Tax Law &sect; 1116 since they failed to demonstrate any injury that they, as owners and operators of nontribal accommodations, would suffer as result of failure of local law to exempt Indian tribes from its reach. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation--Hotel and Motel Occupancy Tax--Impermissible Tax on Real Estate.--Local law imposing hotel and motel occupancy tax did not constitute impermissible tax on real estate in violation of NY Constitution; tax on use of real estate is not to be tax on real estate itself. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation--Hotel and Motel Occupancy Tax--Due Process--Equal Protection.--Contention that local law imposing hotel and motel occupancy tax was violative of due process and equal protection because time limits regarding when taxpayers may seek refund were insufficient was rejected since all taxpayers seeking refund or subject to assessment of additional taxes were subject to same time limitations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law--Commerce Clause--Hotel and Motel Occupancy tax.--Contention that local law imposing hotel and motel occupancy tax violated dormant Commerce Clause, which prohibits state taxation that discriminates or unduly burdens interstate commerce, was rejected; local law was nondiscriminatory on its face and did not accord differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefitted former and burdened latter; local law impacted in-state and out-of-state tourists in same way and did not operate to disadvantage of any identifiable interstate market. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation--Hotel and Motel Occupancy Tax--Applicability of CPL.--Contention that local law imposing hotel and motel occupancy tax was unconstitutional with respect to penalties it imposed upon those found to be in violation of law, in that it did not expressly provide for application of Criminal Procedure Law in enforcement and imposition of criminal sanctions provided therein, was reject; provision of Criminal Procedure Law are exclusively applicable to any and all criminal actions prosecuted in state. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The County Court of Chemung County, New York, convicted defendant of three counts of burglary in the second degree and three counts of petit larceny. Two prior felony convictions were proved at a hearing. The trial court adjudicated defendant a persistent felony offender, and he was sentenced as such to concurrent prison terms of 15 years to life. The trial court denied defendant's motion to set aside the sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant argued that the statute pursuant to which he was adjudicated a persistent felony offender, N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law art. 400.20, was unconstitutional because it permitted enhancement of a sentence based on facts not found by a jury. Any fact, other than a prior conviction, that increased the penalty for a crime beyond the statutorily prescribed maximum had to be found by a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt, absent a waiver by a defendant. The instant court found that this rule was not violated in New York because a defendant's prior felony convictions were the sole determinant of whether a defendant was subject to enhanced sentencing as a persistent felony offender. Although the trial court had discretion not to impose a sentence within the enhanced range, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.10(2), it was the prior convictions rather than the trial court's finding that the history and character of defendant and the circumstances of his criminal conduct warranted extended incarceration that initially subjected defendant to enhanced sentencing. Defendant failed to show that his sentence was unconstitutional. Defendant's remaining arguments were unpersuasive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Supreme Court, Bronx County, New York, in a dispute over attorney fees in plaintiff's medical malpractice action, (1) denied appellant law firm's motion and cross-appellant lawyer's motion for relief, (2) continued a prior order directing that the fee be deposited with a county clerk pending further court order, and (3) pursuant to N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 22, pt. 130, imposed financial sanctions on them. The firm and lawyer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The lower court's order was not an unconstitutional attachment or other improper restraint on the payment of the firm's fee. The firm attempted to appropriate the entire fee through the subterfuge of a proposed compromise order that did not disclose the lawyer's claim to half of the fee and that such claim was then being actively litigated before another justice. Once the court learned of the lawyer's claim shortly after signing the compromise, it appropriately exercised its discretion to grant relief from an improperly obtained order, under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 5015(a)(3), by temporarily staying payment of attorney fees and disbursements. The record did not support the firm's claim that the lawyer was not entitled to share in the fee because he violated N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 478 by engaging in the unauthorized practice of law in New York. The award of sanctions against the lawyer was vacated since he did nothing to impair or impede payment of the settlement funds to plaintiff. Under N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 475, the lawyer was to receive 50 percent of the legal fee deposited with the clerk since the fee-sharing agreement clearly provided for an equal split of the legal fee recovered in the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The appeals court modified the order (1) by vacating the sanctions and vacating the award of interest on the amount deposited to plaintiff and (2) by ordering that 50 percent of the deposited fee and accrued interest was to be paid to the lawyer. The court remanded the case to the lower court for further proceedings and to decide whether sanctions were to imposed and interest awarded against the firm and affirmed the remainder of the order.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney and Client--Compensation.--Appellant's claim that orders on appeal constituted unconstitutional attachment or other improper restraint on payment of its fee was rejected--appellant attempted to appropriate entire fee in medical malpractice action through subterfuge of proposed infant's compromise order that did not disclose cross appellant's claim to half of fee and fact that such claim was being litigated before another justice; once court learned of cross appellant's claim shortly after signing infant's compromise, it granted relief from improperly obtained order by temporarily staying payment of portion of infant's compromise constituting attorneys' fees and disbursements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney and Client--Unauthorized Practice of Law.--In connection with dispute between attorneys over division of fee earned in medical malpractice action, record did not support appellant's claim that cross appellant was not entitled to share in fee because he engaged in unauthorized practice of law in New York, in violation of Judiciary Law &sect; 478; at no time did cross appellant ever appear in court, conduct deposition or hold himself out as entitled to practice in New York, and retainer agreement was clear that New York attorney would have to be retained in event of litigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney and Client--Division of Fees.--Cross appellant was entitled to receive 50% of legal fee at issue--fee-sharing agreement between appellant and cross appellant clearly provided for 50/50 split of legal fee recovered in action; there was no evidence to support appellant's contention that division of fee depended on nature and extent of services performed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The New York Workers' Compensation Board (Board) affirmed an order granting death benefits to appellee, decedent's domestic partner, after the attacks of September 11, 2001, pursuant to then pending legislation related to N.Y. Workers' Comp. Law &sect;&nbsp;4. However, the Board declined to reach the constitutional issues raised by the other appellants, the daughter's mother, the employer, and its carrier. This appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The mother challenged the judgment entered. However, although the appeals court agreed with the mother that N.Y. Workers' Comp. Law &sect; 4 created an inequity in the law, such disparate treatment did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Second, &sect; 4 did not violate N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 18, as the legislature was within its discretion to include domestic partners in the class of persons entitled to share in a decedent's workers' compensation death benefit. Third, because the reduction in benefits was prospective only, nothing that the mother's daughter already possessed was taken from her. Moreover, even if the mother were correct that her daughter had a vested property interest in the continued receipt of the decedent's death benefits in a specified amount, due process required nothing more than that a claimant be given notice and an opportunity to be heard, which was provided. Fourth, because nothing more than an expectancy interest was at issue, no unconstitutional taking occurred. Finally, the mother's assertion that N.Y. Workers' Comp. Law &sect; 4 constituted an invalid delegation of legislative power lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Workers' Compensation Death Benefits Resulting from Employee's Death in September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 4, which afforded the domestic partners of employees killed in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks the same death benefits available to surviving spouses, was not unconstitutional as applied to claimant, whose daughter's workers' compensation death benefit resulting from decedent's death in the terrorist attacks had to be shared with decedent's domestic partner. The disparate treatment of dependent children based upon whether their fathers were killed in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks was not violative of equal protection under the &quot;rational basis&quot; test. The challenged statutory classification bears a rational relationship to the State's legitimate governmental interest in aiding its citizens in a time of crisis and preventing further inflation of the welfare rolls. Nor was the inclusion of domestic partners in the statute violative of the &quot;trade off&quot; underlying the workers' compensation provisions of the State Constitution. New York Constitution, article I, &sect; 18 grants the Legislature the power to create an exclusive system of compensation for injuries sustained by employees, including the power to define who should be entitled to relief for damages. Furthermore, the prospective reduction in the benefits awarded to claimant's daughter did not result in either a due process violation or a Takings Clause violation. </SPAN></P>
