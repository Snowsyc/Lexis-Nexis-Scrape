<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which denied defendant's motion to vacate his conviction for carrying a concealed weapon. Defendant had contended that Wisconsin's concealed weapon statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.23 (1999-2000), violated Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 25. The lower appellate court certified the matter to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted after police found two concealed weapons within the vehicle in which defendant was riding. The court held that the presumption of constitutionality applied, even though the statute predated the constitutional amendment. Although Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 25 created a fundamental right, the right was still subject to reasonable restriction. The correct test was whether the statute was a reasonable exercise of the State's inherent police powers. The court concluded that the statute was a reasonable regulation on the time, place, and manner in which the right to bear arms could be exercised. It did not unreasonably infringe upon a citizen's ability to exercise the right. The statute was facially valid, in light of the plain language of the amendment, legislative intent, and public opinion polls. The court stressed the compelling state interest in protecting the public from the hazards involved with certain types of weapons, such as guns. Even if defendant had not waived the opportunity to challenge the constitutionality of the statute as applied to him by pleading guilty, defendant presented no evidence of any threat against him at or near the time he was arrested.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.23 (1999-2000). The case came before the court on bypass from the Court of Appeals. Defendant asked the court to determine the effect of a new constitutional amendment, Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 25, on the State's ability to prosecute the carrying of concealed weapons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant owned a grocery store that had been robbed several times. Officers entered the store to conduct a license check and asked defendant if he kept a gun in the store. Defendant removed a gun from the front pocket of his pants. Following his conviction for carrying a concealed weapon (CWW), defendant argued that his conviction impaired his constitutional rights under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 25. The court agreed. Strict application of the CWW statute disallowed the reasonable exercise of defendant's constitutional right to keep and bear arms for the lawful purpose of security. Defendant's interests in maintaining a concealed weapon in his store substantially outweighed the State's interest in enforcing the CWW statute. Moreover, defendant had no reasonable means of keeping the weapon in his store except to conceal it. Defendant's conviction was not proper because he was not allowed to raise as a defense his right to keep and bear arms for security; that right, when exercised within one's own business and supported by a factual determination that one did not have an unlawful purpose, would usually provide a constitutional defense to the charge of violating the CWW statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded with directions that the case should be dismissed unless the State could show probable cause that defendant had an unlawful purpose when he was carrying the concealed weapon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate sought review of an unpublished decision of a court of appeals (Wisconsin), which affirmed a circuit court order that denied the inmate's pro se post-conviction Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06 (1999-2000) motion. The circuit court ruled that the inmate's motion was barred under the Escalano-Narajno rule because it made claims that were barred because the issues could and should have been raised on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted on charges of attempted first-degree intentional homicide and first-degree reckless endangerment while armed after he shot a gang member. The inmate claimed self-defense. The inmate's post-conviction motions and his direct appeal were denied. He then attempted his &sect;974.06 motion, wherein he reasserted many of his prior claims of error. On appeal of the denial of that motion, the inmate asked the court to overrule the Escalona-Narajno rule that any claim that could have been raised on direct appeal or in a previous &sect; 974.06 motion was barred from being raised in a subsequent &sect; 974.06 motion. The court refused to do so. Reiterating the need for finality in litigation, the court reaffirmed its previous decision. The court also declined to apply the Head rule retroactively to cases on collateral review. That rule clarified the fact that in cases where a defendant asserted an imperfect self-defense claim, the State was required to prove that the defendant had no actual, rather than no reasonable, belief that he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm. The &quot;new rule&quot; announced in Head did not fit any of the Teague criteria for retroactivity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the Escalona-Narajno rule and held that the Head rule would not be applied retroactively to cases on collateral review. It affirmed the decision of the court of appeals, thus affirming the inmate's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which affirmed her 7-month jail sentence under Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(a) (1999-2000) for operating a vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant (OWI), fourth offense, and the denial of her postconviction motion and held that the use of the Fifth Judicial District OWI Sentencing Guidelines did not violate her due process and equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant failed field sobriety tests, after she was found asleep in the driver's seat of her vehicle, which was in a ditch. A jury found defendant guilty of OWI, Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(a) (1999-2000), and of operating a motor vehicle while having a prohibited blood alcohol concentration, Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(b). The court agreed with the court of appeals that the district-by-district guidelines were constitutional, as they fulfilled the rational basis test by reducing sentence disparity within judicial districts. The court concluded that the guidelines, which matched up appropriate sentences within the statutory ranges to aggravating and mitigating factors, were authorized by Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.65(2m)(a) (1999-2000). The court held that, while the guidelines only applied to Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(b), defendant's sentencing under &sect; 346.63(1)(a) did not deprive her of standing to challenge the constitutionality of the guidelines on which the circuit court properly relied in the exercise of discretion. The court declined to utilize its supervisory powers over the state courts to abrogate use of the guidelines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner may have desired to resign as judge and run for county executive, and if elected, hold office. The court interpreted the phrase &quot;during the term for which elected&quot; as used in Wis. Const. art. VII, &sect; 10(1). It considered whether that provision prohibited a judge or justice of a court of record in Wisconsin from holding a nonjudicial position of public trust during the entire period of time for which he was elected and entitled to serve as a judge or justice, even if the person resigned from the judicial position before the term would otherwise expire. Second, if such a prohibition existed, it considered whether it deprived a resigned judge or justice of liberty and equal protection. The court held that Wis. Const. art. VII, &sect; 10(1) was more than a dual office holding provision and did prohibit a judge or justice from holding a nonjudicial position of public trust during the entire term for which he or she was originally elected, not simply during the judge or justice's actual time of service. Such a restriction did not violate petitioner's constitutional rights because state interests such as maintaining the integrity of its judicial system outweighed any burden.</SPAN></P>

The proposed ordinance at issue, initiated by a group of citizens, would have required the village to hold a binding referendum prior to the start of construction on any new village building project requiring a capital expenditure of $ 1 million or more. The board neither adopted the proposed ordinance nor referred it for a vote. The citizens then sought a writ of mandamus to compel action on the petition under &sect; 9.20. The circuit court denied the writ but the appellate court reversed. The supreme court affirmed the appellate court's decision, stating that the proposed ordinance was legislative in nature, did not repeal any existing ordinance, fell within the powers of the board, and did not modify statutory procedures.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a negotiated guilty plea, defendant was convicted of aggravated battery, Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.19(6) (1999-2000), and special circumstances battery (battery by prisoner), Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.20(1) (1999-2000). The circuit court denied multiplicity and double jeopardy claims under U.S. Const. amend. V and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 8(1), finding that his plea waived the issue. The court of appeals (Wisconsin) reversed, and the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an inmate, assaulted his wife over a 45 minute period. In reversing the finding of multiplicity, the court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.66(2m) (1999-2000) was not intended to prohibit cumulative punishments from convictions under the special circumstances statute. The court noted that there was no dispute that the offense of aggravated battery was not identical in law to the offense of battery by prisoner. Consequently, there was not a double jeopardy violation involving &quot;the same offense,&quot; and a presumption arose that the legislature intended to permit cumulative punishments. In finding that the presumption was not rebutted by a clear legislative intent to the contrary, the court reasoned that the literal language of &sect; 939.66(2m) was ambiguous. The presumption was supported by (1) the marked difference in the elements of the two offenses; (2) the legislative history, from which the court inferred an intent to apply &sect; 939.66(2m) only to Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.19; (3) the nature of the proscribed conduct; and (4) the difference in the protected interests. Because the multiplicity objection failed, the court did not decide whether, by pleading guilty, defendant waived his claim.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. The State listed several acceptable race-neutral reasons for its strike of the juror and provided a detailed police report of contacts at his address in support of its reasons for the strike. Although the State did not individually question the juror further, such questioning was not necessary. The record supported the State's explanations for the peremptory strike. The State relied on the detailed police report of contacts at the juror's address, along with personal knowledge of prosecutions against other persons with the same name, and observations of the juror and his answers during voir dire. Based on the race-neutral reasons offered by the State for the peremptory strike, defendant did not meet the burden of proof required to show that the State's reasons were not race-neutral.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals concluded that the inmate's constitutional right to due process was violated when the trial court dismissed the petition sua sponte without giving the inmate prior notice of its intent to do so and an additional opportunity to be heard. The court, in reversing, held that the circuit court's dismissal of the petition did not violate the inmate's constitutional right to due process because Wis. Stat. &sect; 802.05(3) provided constructive notice of the potential for a sua sponte dismissal for failure to state a claim. Moreover, there were procedural safeguards that protected a prisoner against erroneous sua sponte dismissals, such as a request for reconsideration or a motion for relief from the order. The inmate also had the option of filing an amended petition after a dismissal without prejudice. The sua sponte dismissal of the inmate's petition did not violate the inmate's constitutional right to equal protection of the law because the classification created by the Wisconsin Prisoner Litigation Reform Act, which recognized that prisoners accounted for a disproportionate amount of meritless litigation, bore a rational relation to a legitimate end.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Wisconsin sought review of a decision of the Winnebago County Circuit Court of Appeals, Wisconsin, which granted habeas corpus relief and ordered the release of petitioner inmate who was a sexually violent person, from commitment as a remedy for the failure of respondent, the Department of Health and Family Services, to conduct a timely post-commitment initial reexamination under Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was committed as a sexually violent person. According to Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.07(1), the department was required to reexamine the inmate's mental condition within six months of his initial commitment. The department failed to do so. The court of appeals found that the six-month time frame in Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.07(1) for an initial reexamination was mandatory and that the inmate was entitled to release from commitment under Wis. Stat. ch. 980 as a remedy. The state supreme court found that, although it agreed with the court of appeals' conclusion that the initial reexamination specified in Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.07 was mandatory rather than directory, it did not follow that the extraordinary remedy of release pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus was proper. Habeas corpus relief was warranted only when no other remedies were adequate. The inmate had not demonstrated that other available remedies, including a petition for supervised release pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.08, or mandamus and contempt, were inadequate. Because there were adequate alternative remedies, habeas corpus relief in the form of discharge and release from commitment was unwarranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sexual assault, child sexual exploitation, delivery of a controlled substance, and two counts of child enticement. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison for assault and to probation on the remaining counts. The court of appeals (Wisconsin) found the enticement counts multiplicitous and vacated all sentences.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court justified the sentence increase on the basis that defendant remained in denial and untreated four years into his prison term. In reversing the appeals court decision, the court applied the Pearce presumption that the sentence was vindictive and in violation of defendant's right to due process. The presumption was triggered by circumstances indicating a likelihood of vindictiveness including the longer sentence, an appeal that posed a direct challenge to the circuit court decision, and the fact that the circuit court was doing over what it thought it had already done correctly. The circuit court's justification regarding lack of treatment was not sufficient to overcome the presumption where treatment was not available. The fact that defendant was in denial was a continuation of the status quo ante, and to premise the sentence on that denial of responsibility came too close to punishing him for using his right to appeal. The court also held that resentencing was unnecessary because the invalidation of the one count on double jeopardy grounds had no impact at all on the overall sentence structure. The court noted, however, that defendant requested resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court concluded that the trial court did have jurisdiction to conduct the ch. 980 proceedings to commit defendant since the conduct at the heart of ch. 980, both past and potential future conduct, was prohibited and not merely regulated; therefore, the State of Wisconsin had jurisdiction pursuant to Pub. L. 83-280. The supreme court also found there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that defendant was a &quot;sexually violent person&quot; for purposes of civil commitment under ch. 980.

The trial court declared the rule void and the Wisconsin Court of Appeals reversed. The president appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rule at issue provided that the board could engage a hearing examiner to conduct the initial hearing and the continuing evidentiary hearings when disciplinary action was taken against a city police officer or firefighter under Wis. Stat. &sect; 62.13(5) (1999-2000). On review, the president contended the board exceeded its statutory authority in promulgating the rule. The supreme court disagreed, finding that the rule plainly came within the board's express authority to promulgate rules for the administration of &sect; 62.13(5), and was consistent with the legislature's express authorization that the board could make rules for that purpose. Further, the board remained the ultimate decision-making authority under the rule, and, therefore, did not impermissibly abdicate its duties to a hearing examiner. The rule was based upon a proper delegation of power by the legislature, and did not constitute administrative action in excess of that statutorily conferred authority. As such, the appellate court properly reversed the trial court's holding that the rule was void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband filed a combined response and cross-appellant's brief. The wife's counsel advised the intermediate appellate court by letter that the wife did not intend to file a response brief to the cross-appeal. The intermediate appellate court then ordered the wife to file either a responsive brief or a letter stating that she had decided not to file the brief. The wife's counsel responded to this order by another letter. The intermediate appellate court then found that the wife violated the rules of appellate procedure by not filing a response brief, and summarily reversed the trial court's order on the issues raised in the husband's cross-appeal. The appellate court ruled that to dismiss an appeal under the sanction provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.83(2) (1999-2000), there needed to be a showing that an appellant or an attorney had shown bad faith or egregious conduct, or there must have been a common sense finding that the appeal was abandoned. The intermediate appellate court did not make any of these findings. This was clearly erroneous.

The court of appeals certified the issues to the state supreme court due to its concerns as to whether it had jurisdiction to issue a supervisory writ to a judge presiding over a John Doe proceeding. The state supreme court held that: (1) the court of appeals had jurisdiction to issue a supervisory writ to a John Doe judge; (2) that a John Doe judge had the authority to disqualify counsel for a witness in a John Doe proceeding, but had to ensure that there was a record of that decision for review; and (3) that when documents were submitted under seal in connection with a petition for supervisory writ that stemmed from a secret John Doe proceeding, the court of appeals had to conduct an in camera review of those documents prior to issuing an order that continued the sealing of such documents.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 236 (1999-2000) authorized the city to reject a preliminary plat under its extraterritorial jurisdictional authority based on a subdivision ordinance that considered the plat's proposed use. The appellate court held that Wis. Stat. ch. 236 did authorize a municipality to reject a preliminary plat under its extraterritorial jurisdictional authority based upon a subdivision ordinance that considers the plat's proposed use. Because prior case law declared otherwise, the court found the prior case was in error. The court also concluded that the standards set forth in the subdivision ordinance were neither vague nor applied in an arbitrary, unreasonable, or discriminatory manner. Accordingly, The city acted within its authority in rejecting the owners' plat.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police found cocaine, a gun, and bullets in the apartment that belonged to defendant and her boyfriend. Defendant, after being given a Miranda warning, admitted that the drugs were hers. The boyfriend, in a subsequent interview with police, responded &quot;yeah right&quot; when asked if the drugs were his. At trial, the judge, over defense counsel's objections, stated it was his practice to use numbers over names for the jurors, as it was a drug case. Defendant appealed the use of numbers instead of the jurors' names and the exclusion of the boyfriend's statement. The state supreme court held: (1) this was not a true anonymous jury, as the parties had access to the jurors names, but the trial court erred in restricting the information, as it failed to make an individualized determination that the jury needed protection and failed to take reasonable precautions to minimize prejudice to defendant; (2) the error was harmless, given the substantial amount of evidence regarding defendant's guilt; (3) the trial court did not err in excluding the boyfriend's statement, as it was not clearly a statement against penal interest; and (4) defendant was not denied a right to a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the court of appeals (Wisconsin), which affirmed the judgment of the trial court convicting defendant of repeated acts of sexual assault of the same child, in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.025(1) (1997-1998), and convicting him of being a persistent repeater under Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.62(2m)(a)1m., (b)2., and (c) (1997-1998), known as Wisconsin's &quot;two strikes&quot; law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was of convicted of Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.025(1) (1997-1998), and he was also convicted under Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.62(2m)(a)1m., (b)2., and (c) (1997-1998). He was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole and appealed, but the court affirmed. The question raised was whether the &quot;two strikes&quot; law violated the Due Process Clauses of the United States or Wisconsin Constitutions because it required a greater penalty to be imposed on an offender convicted of a second Class B non-fatal child sexual assault than the statutes required to be imposed on an offender convicted of a second Class A felony homicide offense. The court concluded that defendant's constitutional challenge to the &quot;two strikes&quot; law failed. The legislature's interest in protecting the public from child sexual assault offenders, a particular subset of offenders with a perceived high rate of recidivism who victimized an especially vulnerable segment of the population, made it rational for the legislature to impose a greater penalty on an offender convicted of a second Class B non-fatal child sexual assault than on an offender convicted of a second Class A homicide offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of repeated sexual assault of a child, placed on probation, and ordered into sex offender treatment. After refusing to admit to the offense during the treatment program, he was terminated from the program. His motion to modify the conditions of probation was denied and his probation was revoked for failure to cooperate with treatment. The Court of Appeals, Wisconsin affirmed. Defendant sought certiorari review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on review was whether the State could constitutionally revoke defendant's probation because he refused, during court-ordered sex offender treatment, and before the time for a direct appeal had expired or an appeal had been denied, to admit to the crime of which he was convicted. The supreme court determined that revocation of defendant's probation was premised on a legitimate assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, and was therefore unconstitutional. Defendant's failure to appeal the denial of his motion to delay sex offender treatment did not constitute a waiver of his right to challenge his probation revocation on Fifth Amendment grounds. Applying the Evans immunity rule as expanded by Thompson, the supreme court held that defendant could not be subjected to probation revocation for refusing to admit to the crime of conviction, unless he was first offered the protection of use and derivative use immunity for what were otherwise compulsory self-incriminatory statements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Revocation of defendant's probation was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a 13-year-old girl died from complications arising out of an appendectomy, plaintiffs filed a wrongful death action. The appellate court reversed the judgment of the circuit court, which had entered judgment for plaintiffs. The circuit court concluded that the legislature's retroactive increase of the cap on damage for loss of society and companionship in wrongful death cases, from $ 150,000 to $ 500,000 was constitutional. The issue was whether the retroactive increase of the cap for damages for loss of society and companionship enacted by 1997 Wis. Laws 89 (Act) violated a tortfeasor's constitutional right to due process. The court held that it did. At the time of death, Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.04(4) (1995-96) placed a cap on damages in wrongful death actions for loss of society and companionship at $ 150,000. On April 13, 1998, the legislature adopted the Act, which increased the cap to $ 500,000. The Act stated that it applied to actions commenced on the effective date of the amendment. That provision resulted in the increased cap applying retroactively to causes of action that accrued prior to April, 28, 1998, which was impermissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant subject's father, psychiatrist, and case manager filed a three-party petition seeking to commit him pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 51.20(1)(a) (1999-2000). He moved to dismiss, arguing that the fifth standard of dangerousness, Wis. Stat. &sect; 51.20(1)(a)2.e., was unconstitutional. The motion was denied, a jury found him dangerous under the fifth standard, and he was committed. He appealed. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals certified the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subject had schizophrenia. The three petitioners thought that he was exhibiting behavior that had previously led to his hospitalization in critical condition for kidney failure. He argued that &sect; 51.20(1)(a)2.e. was constitutionally infirm because it lacked a requirement of imminent dangerousness to self or others, and because it allowed commitment upon a finding of a substantial probability of something less than physical harm, to wit, mental or emotional harm. The supreme court found that &sect; 51.20(1)(a)2.e. did not allow involuntary commitment upon a finding of mental illness alone, and contained an ascertainable standard of commitment, and was therefore not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. It did not create a class of persons who could be involuntarily committed upon a finding of mere mental or emotional harm, and therefore did not violate equal protection. It did not violate substantive due process because the constitution did not require proof of imminent physical harm prior to commitment for treatment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurer filed a declaratory relief action against defendant insured to determine its rights under a liability policy of insurance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured was rendered a quadriplegic while riding in the car of a friend. The friend's insurance policy had a limit of $ 100,000. The insured made a claim with his own policy under the underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage. The insurer applied the reducing provision of the policy to reduce the UIM payments by the $ 100,000 paid by the friend's insurer. The appellate court reversed the decision of the court of appeals and held that while the reducing clause in the insurer's policy complied with the provision in Wis. Stat. &sect; 632.32(5)(i) (1999-2000), its limitation on UIM coverage was ambiguous in the context of the entire policy. The court held that a reasonable insured would not realize or expect that the insured's recovery under the UIM provision of the policy would be reduced by the payments received from the underinsured motorist. Thus, in the context of the entire policy, the reducing clause was ambiguous and rendered the UIM coverage illusory. When the policy as a whole failed to set forth a clear, understandable description of the UIM coverage being purchased, the reducing clause was ambiguous within the context of the insurance contract.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the court of appeals erred by allowing the evidence of his blood test because the forcible blood draw, in light of his consent to a breath test instead, violated his constitutional right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures. The supreme court disagreed. The rapid dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream created an exigency that justified the nonconsensual test of the blood of defendant for OWI. Specifically, the blood draw was taken to obtain evidence of intoxication from defendant who was lawfully arrested for OWI, there was a clear indication that the blood draw would produce evidence of intoxication, the blood sample was taken by a reasonable method, in a reasonable manner, and defendant presented no reasonable objection to the blood draw. Defendant's agreement to submit to a breath test did not negate the exigency, nor render unconstitutional the nonconsensual test of the officer's choice. Therefore, the court of appeals did not err.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, four of the five members sitting on the case found the respondents' motion frivolous and awarded fees, costs, and attorney fees. The award of sanctions was mandatory under Wisconsin statutes. Every single reported case in the last 20 years involving a finding of frivolousness resulted in the award of attorney fees and costs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to deliver. A penalty enhancer was applicable if the offense was committed within 1,000 feet of protected places. At trial the State introduced no evidence to show the status of the park in question qualified for penalty enhancement purposes, but, after the close of the evidence the court took judicial notice that the park was a city park that qualified for penalty enhancement purposes and instructed the jury to accept the status of the park as found by the court as true. On review defendant challenged the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 902.01(7) (1997-98) as applied to the &quot;protected place&quot; element of Wis. Stat. &sect; 961.49(1)(b) (1997-1998), the penalty enhancer in his criminal case. The supreme court held that the circuit court's jury instruction regarding the status of the park had the effect of eliminating the jury's opportunity to reach an independent, beyond-a-reasonable-doubt decision on that element, and was therefore constitutional error. However, the court held the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the elemental fact on which the jury was improperly instructed was undisputed and indisputable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a petition seeking to commit respondent as a sexually violent person under Wis. Stat. ch. 980 (1997-98). After a trial, the jury found respondent was a sexually violent person. Respondent's postconviction motion challenging the jury instructions was denied, and respondent was committed. The Court of Appeals, District I (Wisconsin), summarily affirmed the circuit court and respondent petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review the parties were instructed to address whether respondent's due process rights were violated because there was no jury determination regarding respondent's level of volitional control. The supreme court denied respondent's substantive due process challenge, and held that Wis. Stat. ch. 980, (1997-98) was constitutional. The supreme court found that the evidence required for commitment, namely, that the person's mental disorder predisposed such individual to engage in acts of sexual violence, and that there was a substantial probability that such person would again commit such acts, necessarily and implicitly included proof that such person's mental disorder involved serious difficulty in controlling his or her behavior. Such evidence, the supreme court held, served to distinguished such a person from the dangerous but typical recidivist. The supreme court further held that the jury instruction at respondent's trial on the meaning of sexually violent offenses was proper, and rejected respondent's contention that grounds existed for a discretionary reversal, finding that the real controversy between the parties had been fully and fairly tried.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State petitioned to have respondent involuntarily committed to institutional care under Wis. Stat. ch. 980 (1999-2000). The Circuit Court for Kenosha County, Wisconsin, denied respondent's motion challenging the constitutionality of ch. 980. After a trial, respondent was found to be a sexually violent person under ch. 980 and ordered committed to institutional care. The Court of Appeals (Wisconsin) certified respondent's appeal for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While respondent awaited trial, the legislature amended Wis. Stat. ch. 980 (1997-98) to limit a ch. 980 respondent's ability to seek supervised release as an alternative to institutional commitment and to require a person committed to institutional care to wait 18 months, rather than 6, to petition the committing court for supervised release. Respondent contended the changes rendered ch. 980 unconstitutional on its face. The court held the Hudson intent-effects test was the proper test to determine if a statute was punitive for purposes of the Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto Clauses of the Wisconsin Constitution, Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, para. 1 and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, as well as of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Const. amend. V and U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. Under that test, the court held that Wis. Stat. ch. 980 (1999-2000) was not a criminal, punitive statute, and thus did not violate the Double Jeopardy or Ex Post Facto Clauses. The court also held that ch. 980 served compelling state interests of treatment of the dangerously mentally ill and protection of the public, and it was narrowly tailored to meet those interests. Thus, it did not violate substantive due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the circuit court's denial of respondent's motion challenging the constitutionality of the sexually violent person involuntary commitment statute, its finding that respondent was a sexually violent person, and its order committing respondent to institutional care.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant farmers challenged the validity of respondent Department of Revenue's emergency rule under Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.40(1) (1999-2000). Intervenor farming organizations joined the action. After the department's summary judgment motion was granted, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals certified the question of whether the department exceeded its authority under Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.32(2r) (1999-2000) when it promulgated Wis. Admin. Code &sect; Tax 18.08.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department used its authority under Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.24(1) (1999-2000) to promulgate an emergency rule that would assess agricultural land at full use-value as of January 1, 2000. Prior to the expiration of the emergency rule, the department promulgated a new rule that would replace the emergency rule upon its expiration. The farmers argued that the department exceeded its authority in promulgating the emergency rule and eliminating 8 years of the 10 year phase-in of the use-value assessment as required by &sect; Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.32(2r)(b) (1999-2000). The appellate court concluded that Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.32 (1999-2000) was unambiguous and gave the department authority to promulgate the rules. The court noted that Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.32(2r)(b) (1999-2000) provided that the mixed-use assessment for land value ended no later than December 31, 2008. The court noted however, that as the legislature did not specify a mandatory 10 year period, the department was within its authority to end the mixed use assessment earlier.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Law enforcement ran an internet sting operation in which an agent posed online as a 13-year-old boy. Defendant began online conversations with the &quot;boy.&quot; The &quot;boy&quot; told defendant he was 13, they discussed sexually explicit matters, and defendant set up a meeting, acknowledging that it was illegal. The &quot;boy&quot; gave defendant his phone number, another agent impersonated the &quot;boy&quot; to defendant over the phone, surveillance followed defendant from his home to the meeting place, and he was arrested there. Defendant admitted to the above and to setting up the meeting to have sex with the &quot;boy.&quot; The supreme court found that Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.07 (1999-2000), attempted child enticement, could be charged, where the intervening extraneous factor that made the offense an attempted rather than completed crime was the fact that, unbeknownst to defendant, the &quot;victim&quot; was not a child, but an adult posing as a child. Legal impossibility was not a defense to the crime of attempt, absent the defendant's &quot;mistake.&quot; A fact of which defendant had no knowledge could not form the basis for the defense of mistake. The statute regulated conduct rather than expression. The First Amendment was not implicated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's post-conviction motion seeking to vacate his conviction for carrying a concealed weapon under Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.23 (1999-2000) was denied. Defendant appealed and the Wisconsin Court of Appeals certified to the instant court the question of whether the prohibition against going armed with a concealed and dangerous weapon as set forth in &sect; 941.23 was unconstitutional in light of the adoption of Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 25.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On November 6, 1998, defendant created a disturbance and was arrested with a gun on his person. The question arose whether Wis. Const. art.

Stat. &sect; 941.23 (1999-2000). The constitutional amendment was on the ballot in the general election on November 3, 1998, and was ratified that day by 74 percent of the vote cast.  Wisconsin Stat. &sect; 7.70(3)(h) (1999-2000) set forth the effective date of a constitutional amendment as the time the chairperson of the state elections board certified that the amendment was approved. The supreme court held the legislature had the authority under Wis. Const. art. XII, &sect; 1, to adopt reasonable election laws such as Wis. Stat. &sect; 7.70(3)(h) (1999-2000), to provide that state constitutional amendments were effective after canvass and certification. Further, pursuant to &sect; 7.70(3)(h), Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 25, was not in effect on November 6, 1998, when the offense was committed. Accordingly, defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant gave a 17 year-old nude pictures of himself. Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by denying his motion to withdraw his no contest plea, as it was not knowingly and voluntarily entered. The supreme court disagreed. In order for defendant's plea to have been knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, he needed to be aware of the nature of the offense to which he was pleading. Based on the record, including both the signed plea questionnaire and the plea colloquy, he was aware and understood the elements of Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.11(2) (1997-1998) to which he pleaded. The elements of &sect; 948.11(2) were clearly laid out on the plea questionnaire. Furthermore, during the plea colloquy, defendant acknowledged that he understood the plea form, and that the information in the form was truthful. Moreover, at the postconviction hearing, defendant testified that he understood the elements of the offense, and that he knew the photos were harmful and were totally inappropriate for children.

The agent appealed and the Wisconsin Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court's order. The principal sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principal refused to pay commissions on orders prior to August 6, 1999, and the agent alleged that the refusal to pay constituted a breach of contract and violated the Wisconsin Sales Representative Act, specifically Wis.

Stat. &sect; 134.93(1)(b) (1999-2000) included a corporation. The Wisconsin Supreme Court held that based on the unambiguous language of Wis. Stat. &sect; 134.93(1)(b) (1999-2000), the common and ordinary meaning of the term person, and the relevant language of the entire statute, it agreed with the court of appeals, and concluded that the term &quot;person&quot; included a corporation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant argued, inter alia, that the circuit court erred by denying his motion for a new trial, because it excluded the testimony of an expert witness who was qualified, and that exclusion deprived the defendant of his constitutional right to present a defense. The supreme court agreed. The expert was to testify regarding how the statistics about recanters returning to their original accusation did not help determine the truthfulness of a victim in a particular case. The expert's testimony was admissible, the testimony was relevant and necessary to the defendant's case, and the probative value of the testimony outweighed its prejudicial effect. In exercising its discretion to exclude the testimony of the defendant's expert witness, the circuit court failed to take into account, as the defendant requested, whether the defendant was denied his constitutional right to present a defense. In applying the two-part inquiry, the exclusion of the testimony of the expert witness about recantation and interview techniques denied the defendant his constitutional right to present evidence clearly central to his defense. Therefore, the circuit court erred.</SPAN></P>

The defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress because the warrant was insufficient to establish probable cause. The supreme court disagreed. The thrust of the affidavit was that the defendant murdered four women, retained various mementos to remind him of the murders, and the items were likely to be found in his house because serial killers retained such items indefinitely. Because the affidavit established particular instances in which the defendant exhibited patterns of behavior typical of a serial homicide offender, it was reasonable for the warrant judge to infer that the defendant would exhibit other characteristics that an investigator indicated were associated with serial homicide offenders. Thus, the judge could have reasonably inferred that the defendant had taken the missing personal items from the victims and would have retained those items. Therefore, the trial court did not err by denying the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. It concluded that the motion to vacate, coming as it did almost two years after the public disclosure of the information pertinent to the movants' claims and shortly before oral argument in a similar United States Supreme Court case, was filed in bad faith for an improper purpose, to undermine the public's confidence in the legitimacy of the supreme court's decision and the integrity of the supreme court as an institution. The only reasonable inference that could have been drawn from the untimeliness and suspect timing of the motion was that it was brought in bad faith for an improper purpose.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant struck the victim, and the victim suffered a severe brain injury. The State and the defendant entered into a negotiated plea agreement. The State amended the information to reduce the original count of aggravated battery to one count of recklessly endangering safety, retained the original count of recklessly endangering safety, and eliminated the repeat offender allegations. The defendant's exposure was reduced from 27 years in state prison to 10 years. The defendant was sentenced to consecutive five year terms in prison on each count of recklessly endangering safety. The defendant filed a post-conviction motion for relief alleging that the two counts of recklessly endangering safety were multiplicitous and violated the double jeopardy clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The appellate court held that the defendant's motion to vacate a conviction on one count and withdraw his plea of no contest to one of the two counts of the amended information constituted a repudiation of the plea agreement and that the parties should be restored to the same positions they respectively held before the defective plea agreement was entered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant moved to suppress evidence seized from her home because the State failed to make a contemporaneous record of the telephonic search warrant application in accordance with Wis. Stat. &sect; 968.12(3)(d) (1997-1998). The appellate court upheld the reconstruction of the application as there was no evidence of police misconduct in failing to record the search warrant application, the time between the application and the reconstruction only 18 hours, only one witness was needed to reconstruct the warrant, and the testimony of that witness was corroborated by other evidence submitted simultaneously by other police officers during the original telephonic application. A criminal defendant was not entitled to the right to counsel during a reconstruction hearing for a search warrant as technically no defendant existed. When a warrant application was reconstructed, the trial court had to find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the reconstruction adequately replaced the missing portion of the record. As the warrant was properly reconstructed, probable cause existed to support the warrant and the evidence seized as a result of the warrant did not have to be suppressed.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court determined, based on the rationales and conclusions of prior cases, that the 30-day deadline for receipt of the prisoner's petition for review was tolled on the date that he delivered a correctly addressed petition to the proper prison authorities for mailing. It declined to interpret the term &quot;file&quot; in Wis. Stat. &sect; 808.10 (1999-2000) and Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.62(1) (1999-2000) to mean deposit in a prison mailbox, and reaffirmed the general vitality of the petition for review filing requirements. However, a tolling rule was necessary to protect pro se prisoners who sought to file petitions from prison rules and procedures that circumscribed their control over the filing process, and from vagaries of the mail.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenants signed a residential lease which included a provision that would require them to pay attorney's fees and costs incurred in enforcing the lease agreement. They later broke the lease, and the landlord sued them. On appeal, the tenants alleged that the landlord could not enforce the lease since the provision was prohibited by Wis. Admin. Code &sect; ATCP 134.08(3). The supreme court determined that because the lease included a provision in violation of &sect; ATCP 134.08(3), the landlord could not enforce the lease against the tenants. Holding the lease unenforceable by the landlord not only advanced the intent underlying &sect; ATCP 134.08(3), but prevented the objectives of the regulation from being wholly undermined. Accordingly, summary judgment was properly granted in the tenants' favor.</SPAN></P>

A prospective juror was objectively biased as a matter of law and should have been removed for cause, but defendant used a peremptory challenge to strike the juror.

The court concluded that the Ramos decision should be replaced with a harmless error analysis consistent with Wis. Stat. &sect; 805.18(2) (1997-98). The error did not affect defendant's substantial rights; thus the conviction was affirmed. Defendant also claimed that counsel was ineffective for failing to impeach a witness for the prosecution, but defendant was not prejudiced by counsel's performance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate challenged two of the department's administrative regulations on First Amendment and Equal Protection grounds. The trial court concluded that he was required to exhaust his administrative remedies under the PLRA. The appellate court erroneously held that there was a common law futility exception to the PLRA's statutory exhaustion requirement. The PLRA eliminated any common law futility exception in the context of prisoner litigation and mandated exhaustion regardless of the relief sought. The exhaustion requirement in the PLRA created a preliminary procedure that had to be completed before the inmate could mount a constitutional challenge in circuit court. The appellate court's ruling that Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.40, a declaratory judgment statute, trumped the PLRA was also erroneous. The PLRA was more specific and was enacted later than the declaratory judgment statute; thus the PLRA was controlling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the father of nine children, agreed to plea no contest to three counts of intentionally refusing to support his children. The sentencing judge imposed, as a condition of probation, that defendant could not have any more children unless he could show he had the ability to support them and that he was supporting the children he already had.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who during the relevant time period paid no child support and was in arrears in excess of $ 25,000, challenged the constitutionality of the condition of his probation that he not father another child unless he could show that he could support that child and his current children. Defendant argued that the condition violated his right to procreate. The instant court held that that the probation condition was not overbroad, as it did not eliminate defendant's ability to exercise his constitutional right to procreate. Defendant could satisfy the condition of probation by making efforts to support his children as required by law. The condition was reasonably related to the probationary goal of rehabilitation because it would assist defendant in conforming his conduct to the law. The condition was narrowly tailored to serve the compelling state interest of requiring parents to support their children as well as rehabilitating those convicted of crimes. The instant court also concluded that defendant waived any claim of error that the State was impermissibly allowed to withdraw from an earlier plea agreement by entering into a subsequent plea agreement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both lower courts correctly concluded that the affidavit submitted in support of the search warrant did not justify authorizing a no-knock entry.

The court therefore recognized a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule. The court determined that the Wisconsin Constitution required the State to show that the process used in obtaining the search warrant included a significant investigation and a review by either a police officer trained and knowledgeable in the requirements of probable cause and reasonable suspicion, or a knowledgeable government attorney. This requirement was met in this case. The good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied, and the evidence was admissible at trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police obtained a warrant to search defendant's residence, but the warrant did not authorize a no-knock entry. The court reviewing the reasonableness of the no-knock execution of the search warrant was not precluded from considering facts known to the police but not included in the search warrant application. The magistrate's refusal to pre-authorize the no-knock entry did not alter the reasonableness of the officers' decision, which had to be evaluated as of the time the warrant was executed. The considerations typically justifying dispensing with the rule of announcement were present in this case. The officers reasonably suspected that defendant might destroy the drug evidence, and they also reasonably suspected that announcing entry might have endangered their safety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. The reviewing court properly considered evidence beyond that which was included in the warrant application in evaluating the reasonableness of the no-knock entry. The evidence was sufficient to support the no-knock entry and defendant's suppression motion was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed an objection to a village assessor's 1998 assessment of a property for which she was trustee. Defendant village sustained the assessment. Plaintiff then filed an action in the Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) Circuit Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.37(6) (1997-98) was unconstitutional. The court denied the request, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff argued that Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.37(6) legislated disparate treatment because it allowed owners of property located in counties with a population of less than 500,000 to challenge a property assessment with a full trial in the circuit court, while those with a population of 500,000 or more were not allowed a full trial &quot;de novo&quot; in the circuit court. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed the two lower courts, holding that the statute violated equal protection under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The population classification treated members of the class significantly different than members outside the class, and there was no rational basis for this disparate treatment based solely on the population of the county in which a property was situated. The court overruled S.C. Johnson &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Town of Caledonia, 206 Wis. 2d 292, 557 N.W.2d 412 (Ct. App. 1996), to the extent that case upheld the constitutionality of the statute.

The State claimed that the property owners were required to obtain a permit before depositing the fill since that section of property was a bed of navigable water. The property owners claimed that the land was not the bed of navigable water. The Wisconsin Supreme Court held: (1) the issue as to whether a property owner was required to obtain a permit before depositing fill on land submerged below navigable water regardless of whether the land was above or below the ordinary high water mark could not be resolved on appeal and was remanded since it was of statewide importance; (2) the property owners' arguments as to constitutional challenges involving uncompensated taking, excessive fines, and a five-year delay in enforcement were unpersuasive; and (3) the dam permit did not set forth mandatory water levels, therefore, the water levels about which the property owners complained did not violate the dam permit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee employee was injured on the job and sued the appellant manufacturer of the machine. The employee sought a declaration that retroactive application of Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.045(1) (1995-1996) was unconstitutional. The Circuit Court for Calumet County (Wisconsin) concluded that retroactive application of &sect; 895.045(1) was unconstitutional and the manufacturer appealed. The court of appeals certified the appeal to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee argued that he had a vested right to recover all of his damages from any defendant that may be jointly and severally liable for his injuries, including the manufacturer, and that applying Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.045(1) (1995-1996) retroactively to his claim was unconstitutional. The Wisconsin Supreme Court held that retroactive application of &sect; 895.045 was unconstitutional. It found that the employee had a vested right in his claim for negligence on the date of his injury, and because the injury occurred before the effective date of the amendment which changed the joint and several liability law, included in that claim was the right to recover under an unmodified doctrine of joint and several liability. The court further held that the employee's right to recovery significantly outweighed the public interest served by retroactive application of &sect; 895.045(1). He was entitled to a full recovery of his damages at the time he was injured from any defendant found causally negligent. It would be unfair and violate due process to change that rule after the fact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer sought to construct a marina on the shore of Lake Superior, but the department denied a dredging permit needed to complete the final phase of the marina development. The lower court properly concluded that the denial of the permit was not an unconstitutional taking. Under takings jurisprudence, the property was considered as a whole. The regulatory action at most affected only the developer's riparian right of reasonable access to the lake, which was subordinate to the public trust doctrine. Therefore, the department's action did not so severely impact or interfere with the developer's reasonable investment expectations as to constitute an unconstitutional taking under traditional, ad hoc takings analysis. The fact that the marina development yielded a loss did not make out a takings case, and the developer never possessed an unfettered right to a particular number of boat slips.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The summary judgment entered in favor of the department was affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an individual employee and the public employees' union, sought a declaratory judgment against respondents, a county and the county pension board, asserting that respondents were wrongfully denying pension benefits to certain employees. The Milwaukee (Wisconsin) Circuit Court ruled in favor of plaintiffs, but the Court of Appeals reversed. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dispute concerned the county's practice of denying pension benefits to employees who were terminated &quot;for cause,&quot; even if the employee was otherwise entitled to a deferred vested pension. The individual plaintiff had worked for the county for 16 years before being terminated for a disciplinary violation. The trial court held that the county's procedure did not satisfy due process or equal protection concerns. The intermediate court disagreed as to the due process issue and also held that the union had waived any equal protection claim. The supreme court reversed, holding that although the union had waived any equal protection claim, procedural due process required the county to provide a hearing to determine whether an employee was terminated for fault or delinquency as provided in the county code. The issue was justiciable, as the individual plaintiff was vested in the sense that he had completed enough years of service to earn a pension, and the union had a tangible interest in knowing what rights its members had. Finally, a declaratory judgment action was an appropriate method to determine the union members' rights on an important legal issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police conducted a pat down search of the petitioner after she fled from them. The police found a loaded handgun on the petitioner, and she was charged with possession of a dangerous weapon, in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.60 (1997-98). Petitioner moved to suppress the handgun as evidence. The Circuit Court, Milwaukee County, denied her motion and the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin) affirmed. Petitioner sought review of the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the petitioner contended that her initial encounter with the police was a seizure and that the seizure was not justified, because the officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that some criminal activity was taking, or had taken, place. The petitioner claimed that the initial stop was illegal; therefore, all evidence gathered as result of this stop had to be suppressed. The court held that the trial court properly denied the petitioner's motion to suppress the evidence. The police did not seize the petitioner when they told her to &quot;stay put&quot; but she ran away, because she did not yield to the police officers' show of authority. Even if this was considered a seizure, it was justified by the police community caretaker function. The detention of the petitioner, after she fled from the police, was reasonable because the officers had reasonable suspicion that the petitioner had committed, was committing, or was about to commit, a crime. Lastly, the court held that the pat-down search, or frisk, of the petitioner was reasonable because the officers had reasonable suspicion that the petitioner could be armed and dangerous. The court affirmed the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a dispute arose between defendant church congregation and plaintiff state conference, defendant withdrew from plaintiff conference. Defendant continued to operate as an independent, nondenominational congregation.

Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that under the statute, defendant church had become defunct or dissolved, thus, entitling plaintiff to all its property. The circuit court ruled that the statute was triggered only if the local congregation ceased functioning and abandoned the property. The appellate court reversed, concluding that defendant's disavowal of all ties to plaintiff rendered it defunct under the statute. The state supreme court agreed. Defendant's unequivocal withdrawal from, and cessation of ties to plaintiff rendered it, as a local church, defunct under the statute; thus, its property vested in plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the provision in the statute that relieved the jury of any requirement of unanimity as to the specific individual acts of sexual assault that combined to constitute the crime, as long as it unanimously agreed that defendant committed the minimum number required, at least three. The supreme court concluded that under the state and federal constitutional analyses in prior cases, the statute was constitutional. One prior case did not overcome the presumption of constitutionality that attended the legislative determination to dispense with a unanimity requirement for the individual acts of child sexual assault that comprised the crime of repeated sexual assault of the same child. Under the state and federal constitutional analyses of prior caselaw, &sect; 948.025 did not violate due process or the right to a unanimous verdict.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found petitioner guilty of disorderly conduct and the appellate court affirmed. Petitioner, arguing that his First Amendment right to free speech was violated, petitioned for review. The state supreme court agreed. It applied the Perkins test of &quot;true-threat.&quot; Although the court believed that petitioner's story was crude and repugnant, it found that in the context of a creative writing class, petitioner's story did not amount to a true-threat. Petitioner's story, though repugnant and insulting, fell within the protection of the First Amendment. As such, it could not be punished as disorderly conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the State of Wisconsin, brought charges of disorderly conduct against respondent, a juvenile. The Dane County (Wisconsin) Circuit Court dismissed the petition.

I. Respondent filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The disorderly conduct charge was based on statements made by respondent to another juvenile threatening violence toward a number of named individuals. Respondent argued that speech alone could not constitute disorderly conduct, and that his speech was protected under U.S. Const. amend. I. The supreme court affirmed the court of appeals, concluding that application of the disorderly conduct statute to speech alone was permissible under appropriate circumstances, and that in the context of the case, respondent's speech was not constitutionally protected. Although respondent's speech was unaccompanied by any physical contact and was not unreasonably loud, respondent's statements as alleged in the petition constituted serious expressions of an intent to inflict harm, rather than mere &quot;trash talk&quot; or an incitement to political action. Further, the two elements of disorderly conduct were met. Respondent stated that he intended to kill everyone at his middle school and provided graphic detail, which could have provoked retaliatory conduct, and the petition contained sufficient facts to support a finding of probable cause that respondent's conduct was &quot;otherwise disorderly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An unidentified motorist observed appellant's truck driving erratically and called police. Although the officer had not seen the erratic driving himself, when he stopped the truck, he noticed that the driver exhibited signs of intoxication. An intoxilyzer test showed that appellant's blood-alcohol concentration was .21. Appellant moved to suppress, arguing that the unidentified motorist's call did not present reliable and credible grounds to justify the stop. His motion to suppress was denied and he was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant. When the appellate court affirmed, appellant petitioned for review, arguing that the officer's stop was unconstitutional. Appellant's arguments were rejected. The motorist's call contained sufficient indicia of reliability and alleged a potential imminent danger to public safety. Those factors substantially outweighed the minimal intrusion that the stop would have presented had appellant indeed not been intoxicated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in trial court for a third felony conviction for sexual assault on a child, and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole under Wis.

Defendant appealed, claiming that the trial court erred in refusing to allow him to challenge his prior conviction where the conviction was allegedly based on a guilty plea that was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, and that his sentence under Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.62(2m) was unconstitutional cruel and unusual punishment. The court affirmed, holding that defendant did not have a constitutional right to use the enhanced sentence proceeding that was predicated on his prior state conviction to challenge the prior conviction because defendant did not assert that a violation of the constitutional right to a lawyer occurred in that prior conviction, and that the application of Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.62(2m) to defendant did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VIII's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant phoned a 15-year old girl, offering her $ 300 to perform a striptease and other sexual acts on video. Convicted of child enticement and attempted child sexual exploitation, he appealed. The court affirmed. The child enticement statute created one crime with alternate modes of commission that were not so dissimilar in concept or moral equivalency as to implicate fundamental fairness; thus, unanimity was not required. Because the first element of each offense was significantly different, the offenses were not identical in law, thus, prosecuting appellant's single telephone call under both statutes did not constitute multiplicity. Videotapes confiscated from appellant's home, admitted as other acts of evidence of his intent and motive, were highly probative as they depicted girls, similar to the victim, doing precisely what appellant propositioned her to do. Because other acts of evidence did not need to be identical to the charged conduct, and the strong probative value of the videos was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, their admission was proper and the evidence was sufficient to support appellant's convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Jury unanimity was not required on the intent component of the child enticement charge, convicting appellant of both child enticement and attempted child sexual exploitation resulting from a single phone call did not constitute multiplicity, and the trial court did not err by admitting videotapes as &quot;other acts&quot; evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was injured, and her child stillborn, as the result of an accident. At the time of the accident, Wis.

Appellant insurance company claimed the circuit court erred in ruling that the retroactive increase in wrongful death damages available pursuant to Wis.

After conducting a Martin analysis, the court reversed, finding that the public interests served by retroactive application of the increase did not support abrogation of settled expectations that accrued at the time of the accident.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After routine hip replacement surgery, appellants' mother went into cardiac arrest and died.

The judgment was affirmed. Statutory language along with legislative history and precedent led the court to hold that the legislature intended the classification of claimants entitled to bring a wrongful death suit for medical malpractice was not expanded to include adult children.

The policy contained a reducing clause, permitting a setoff of the amount paid to the insured by the underinsured tortfeasor.

The court reversed and remanded, concluding that &sect; 944.205(2)(a) was unconstitutionally overbroad under U.S. Const. amend. I principles, and that the provision was not susceptible to a limiting construction by the court. The court concluded that &sect; 944.205(2)(a) was unconstitutionally overbroad because it improperly prohibited all visual expressions of nudity without explicit consent, including political satire and newsworthy images. The court also concluded that the extent of revision by the court necessary to save &sect; 944.205(2)(a) would have required the court to adopt the role of the legislature, which the court declined to do.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for obstructing an officer, Wis. Stat. &sect; 946.41(1)(1995-96), after he gave the officer false information during a traffic stop. Defendant was arrested at the scene of the traffic stop, escaped, but later was apprehended. On appeal, defendant claimed that under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Wis. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11, the officer lacked lawful authority to ask the passenger his name and date of birth. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin affirmed, holding that when defendant, seized pursuant to a lawful traffic stop, the seizure does not become unreasonable simply because an officer asks defendant for identification during the stop. Defendant was free to decline to answer, and refusal to answer would not have justified prosecution nor given rise to any reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing. However, defendant chose to answer, giving the officer false information, which supported his conviction for obstructing an officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held petitioners' complaint stated a valid claim for relief under the equal protection clause when town and county failed to rezone petitioners' property back to rural development zoning classification from general agricultural classification, but did not state a claim for the denial of substantive due process. They complied with Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.80(1)'s notice provisions by sending timely letter. The federal constitutional claims brought under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 did not have to comply with the Wisconsin notice statute. Petitioners were barred from bringing procedural due process claim because certiorari was an adequate state law remedy available to them when they brought their initial action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two misdemeanors by a six-person jury, under the authority of Wis. Stat. &sect; 756.096(3)(am)(1995-96). The court subsequently ruled that statute violated Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. Although the case challenging the statute was pending before the court at the time of his trial, defendant did not object to the use of a six-person jury at his trial. The court concluded under these limited circumstances, defendant's failure to object functioned as a waiver of his constitutional objection to the use of a six-person jury at his trial. The court found the use of a six-person jury rather than a 12-person jury did not undermine the fundamental integrity of defendant's trial, and the interests of justice did not require the court to exercise its discretionary power to reverse. Defendant's failure to object deprived trial court of the opportunity to the avoid error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to suppress the physical evidence and his statements, alleging an illegal entry. The court concluded the entry was justified by exigent circumstances, specifically the deputy's &quot;hot pursuit&quot; of a burglary suspect and his need to protect the safety of those inside the trailer. The court held the exigency of &quot;hot pursuit&quot; as a justification for a warrantless home entry did not require that the officer himself personally observe the crime or the fleeing suspect. Focusing on what was known and could reasonably be inferred by the officer at the time of the entry, the court held the officer reasonably believed the intruder he was pursuing posed a threat to the safety of the occupants of defendant's trailer. The court concluded the court of appeals' application of the attenuation doctrine was based upon a misconstruction of several of the doctrine's elements. Defendant freely consented to the search.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed. The warrantless entry of defendant's home was justified based on exigent circumstances of hot pursuit and threat to safety and was reasonable.

The location of appellant's farm remained subject to local zoning rules, notwithstanding a department license granting appellant the right to establish such a farm. Further, respondents' actions were purely discretionary and thus immune from suit under Wis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state appealed the decision of the trial court, granting defendant's motion to dismiss, in criminal complaint charging the defendant with eight counts of violating Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.11(2), prohibiting the dissemination of harmful material to minors. On appeal, the court of appeals certified to the Wisconsin Supreme Court the question of whether Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.11(2) was constitutional as applied to a defendant who distributes harmful material to a minor over the internet. Plaintiff contended the statute was constitutional as applied to the defendant's actions in transmitting harmful material to a minor via the internet. The supreme court affirmed the dismissal. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional in the context of the internet and other situations that do not involve face-to-face contact between the minor and the defendant. Defendant lacked the means to ascertain reasonably the age of the persons with whom he corresponded. By requiring the defendant, rather that the state, to prove lack of knowledge regarding the age of the person exposed to material deemed harmful to a child, the statute chilled defendant's protected internet communication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the trial court was affirmed because the statute the defendant was charged under was found unconstitutional in the context of the internet and other situations that do not involve face-to-face contact for impermissibly shifting the to the defendant the burden of proving knowledge of the victim's age and infringing on protected First Amendment expression.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state appealed from the judgment of the Wisconsin Court of Appeals denying injunctive relief sought by attorney general acting on behalf of state under Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 30.294, 823.01, and 832.02 (1995-96), contesting the constitutionality of a newly enacted statute allowing municipality to line section of tributary of navigable creek with concrete.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney general, claiming to be acting on behalf of the state of Wisconsin, brought an action for injunctive relief under Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 30.294, 823.01, and 832.02 (1995-96) requiring a municipality to remove a concrete channel from a section of a tributary of a navigable waterway flowing through the city. The attorney general alleged that Wis. Stat. &sect; 30.056, which exempted the municipality from certain permit requirements related to the concrete channel, was unconstitutional. The county circuit court found the statute unconstitutional and ordered the removal of the concrete. Upon the municipality's appeal, the appellate court reversed, holding that the attorney general could not challenge the constitutionality of the statute. On appeal before the instant court the issue was whether the attorney general had standing to attack the constitutionality of the statute. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the attorney general was barred from challenging the constitutionality of the statute for lack of standing; no statute granted him such authority. Nor was there basis for this authority in the doctrines of great public concern, state as polity, or core function.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Attorney general lacked standing to bring present action because legislature had not granted him statutory authority to attack constitutionality of applicable statute specifically allowing municipality to line a length of tributary of navigable waterway with concrete. Nor did doctrines of great public concern, state as polity, or core function give attorney general claimed authority.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the decision. The court noted their recent holding which found that evidence seized in compliance with the court's per se exception from compliance with the rule of announcement whenever a search warrant is executed seeking evidence of felony drug delivery or dealing was admissible under both the U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Wisconsin sought review of a decision by the lower court that reversed defendant's conviction of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver; the lower court had reversed on the ground that the evidence seized during the search of defendant's home should have been suppressed because the affidavit submitted to the warrant-issuing judge in support of the search warrant failed to provide a substantial basis for finding probable cause that evidence of criminal activity was likely be found at that site. The court concluded that the warrant-issuing magistrate had a substantial basis for finding probable cause to issue the warrant to search defendant's home.

Therefore, she was precluded from raising an argument that the tax levied against her property was an unconstitutional tax; [3]-The city's records showed that the property had continuously been a taxable property pursuant to Wis.

Stat. &sect; 948.02, which had different elements than Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.075(1r) (2013-14), had no mandatory sentence did not render the penalty enhancer irrational.</SPAN></P>

IV because the circuit court found that the vehicle's windows were tinted dark and one could not see into the vehicle at that place and time; the officer testified that he could not see the other occupants in the vehicle due to its windows being tinted dark, and thus the officer asked defendant to step out of the vehicle so that they could speak.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 48.415(4)(a) (2013-14) violated the mother's due process rights because each of her arguments lacked arguable merit, as the trial court's order implicitly, if not explicitly, indicated that she was unfit, the order clearly indicated that the denial of placement could be modified, and the trial court acted in accordance with Wis.

Stat. ch. 980 (2013-14); the State's position in 1980 that the then-applicable chapter, Wis. Stat. ch. 975, would expire before a commitment proceeding could be completed was not inconsistent with its later position seeking commitment under a different and more robust statute; [2]-The State presented evidence of defendant's present need for control, care, and treatment in a confined setting, evidence developed in substantial part after his sentencing in 1980; the question underlying the ch. 980 proceeding was whether defendant was a sexually violent person in 2007, at the conclusion of his time in prison, not in 1980, when he was sentenced.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 9.16(2) (2000), a policy of charging only bar owners when their bartenders served underage drinkers. HOLDINGS: [1]-The scienter of serving an underage drinker was not required because the statute set out a strict liability crime that did not require scienter, as the statute contained no language about scienter and it clearly imposed strict liability on any offender, regardless of mental state; [2]-The city's policy of only charging bar owners was not discriminatory and, therefore, was not unconstitutional. The bar owner clearly failed to show that bar owners were being singled out for prosecution among similarly situated individuals. and the ultimate responsibility to make sure that the law was being followed had to have rested with the owners.</SPAN></P>
