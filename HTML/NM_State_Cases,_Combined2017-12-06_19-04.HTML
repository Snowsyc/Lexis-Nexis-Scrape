</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's parole officer arrived at his house to conduct a routine visit. He saw defendant's car. The curtains and blinds were moving in defendant's room. Defendant did not answer when the officer knocked on the door. He failed to acknowledge the parole officer's presence for twenty minutes. Officers then kicked in the door and found defendant hiding under the bed to avoid an encounter. In defendant's bedroom, the parole officer located defendant's identification card, a pipe, and a baggie with a small amount of methamphetamine. The district court acted properly by denying defendant's motion to suppress the drug evidence. As a condition of parole, defendant agreed to submit to reasonable warrantless searches. He had a diminished expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment. Based on the totality of the circumstances, defendant's behavior gave the parole officer reasonable suspicion to conduct the warrantless search. Defendant's remaining arguments were not preserved for review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a wrongful death suit, defendant county sheriff's department appealed a judgment of the District Court of Bernalillo County, New Mexico, that held it 30 percent liable for the wrongful death of a decedent. Plaintiffs, the decedent's parents and brother, filed a cross appeal, challenging the constitutionality of the cap under the Tort Claims Act and challenging the denial of the brother's claim for consortium damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was killed when his vehicle was struck by a speeding van driven by a corrections officer. After a bench trial, the district court found the corrections officer 70 percent at fault and the sheriff's department 30 percent at fault for failing to enforce traffic laws against jail corrections officers. On review, the court held that the claim fell within the waiver of immunity for law enforcement officers under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-4-12 because the sheriff's department received numerous complaints about dangerous traffic situations on the road where the accident occurred involving its own officers and the jail corrections officers but, despite this knowledge and despite a statutory duty to enforce traffic law, failed to enforce the traffic laws against officers. The court rejected the constitutional challenge to the cap on damages because application of the cap did not violate plaintiffs' right to substantive due process. Further, the decedent's brother was not entitled to damages for loss of consortium because he failed to prove that he and the decedent had a relationship of mutual dependence or that they made common contributions to a life together.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand from the Supreme Court of New Mexico, the court considered defendant's appeal from his convictions of seven counts of sexual exploitation of children by manufacturing child pornography in violation of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-6A-3(D) (2001, amended 2007), specifically analyzing whether the Sexual Exploitation of Children Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 30-6A-1 to 30-6A-4 (1984, as amended through 2007), was void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant set up a video camera in a unisex bathroom adjacent to his office for the purpose of recording females while they used the restroom. Because some of the females were minors, defendant was charged with child pornography offenses. On review, the court held that, as applied to defendant, the statute was void for vagueness. The first statutory element of the offense was a lewd and sexually explicit exhibition, and because of their voyeuristic quality, the recordings produced by defendant satisfied the lewd requirement. However, at the time of defendant's acts in 2004, voyeurism was not a crime, and it did not become a crime until 2007. Retroactively applying judicial precedent to defendant's conduct would violate due process because it would constitute an unforeseeable judicial enlargement of the statute, which would operate like an ex post facto law. It would be unreasonable to expect a person to be on notice that voyeurism was within the scope of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-6A-3(D) in 2004. Therefore, retroactively applying an interpretation of the statute to include acts of voyeurism offended the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the client contended the district court erred in dismissing her breach of the youth-attorney contract against the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) and the Twelfth Judicial District Court (TJDC), and her constitutional claims against the employees; she argued that they were not entitled to judicial immunity because the functions of the AOC, the TJDC, and the employees in finding the client counsel, ensuring counsel's compliance with the youth-attorney contract, and securing replacement counsel when the client's originally appointed attorney was allowed to withdraw, were purely administrative and not judicial in nature. The appellate court disagreed, finding first that there was no allegation that the AOC, the TJDC, and the employees departed from the scope of their duties as court functionaries. Based on either theory of judicial function or integrally related actions, the appellate court held that the AOC, the TJDC, and the employees were shielded from suit by judicial immunity as the client's case related to a specific judicial proceeding and the effectiveness of counsel she was provided, and the issues were integrally related to the client's particular case.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also argued that the registration plate statute,&nbsp;N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-3-18(A) (2007), was unconstitutionally void for vagueness and therefore could not provide a lawful basis for the stop. The appellate court held that the deputy's observation of an obstruction to the license plate provided a sufficient basis to justify the stop. As to defendant's constitutional argument, defendant claimed that the statute did not provide for what on the plate must be &quot;clearly visible.&quot; The appellate court disagreed with defendant's contention that the deputy could identify the critical elements of the license plate. N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-3-18(A) provided citizens fair warning of the prohibited conduct. Further, the appellate court could not conclude that &sect; 66-3-18(A) lacked minimal guidelines for enforcement or failed to constrain the discretion of law enforcement officers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee farm purchased land from a public water utility regulated by appellant New Mexico Public Regulation Commission Commission. A hearing examiner concluded that the utility failed to obtain the Commission's prior approval of the sale. Ultimately, the District Court of Roosevelt County, New Mexico, determined that the Commission did not have jurisdiction to void the utility's sale of the property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the Commission contended the district erred in ruling that the Commission did not have jurisdiction to void the utility's sale of real property when the sale required but did not receive prior approval by the Commission pursuant to N.M.

Ann. &sect; 62-6-12(A) to determine whether the sale was required to be approved. However, the appellate court also held that because that issue had not been adjudicated by the Commission, because it was uncertain from a legal standpoint what would occur once this determination was made, and because the record was inadequately developed as to whether the Commission or the district court was to address whether the sale transaction was void, the issues of jurisdiction and action to void the sale transaction and deeds were premature and not ripe for the appellate court's review.</SPAN></P>

The maximum sentence was determined by the facts in the jury's verdict or a plea agreement and not by the range of sentences available in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32A-2-20(B), and a youthful offender's sentence was first determined by the Delinquency Act and not the criminal code. It was reasonable for the trial court to determine whether the adult sentence for a charged crime would be greater than the juvenile sentence in order to assess who would make findings under &sect; 32A-2-20(B)--a jury or the trial court. The child's convictions did not violate double jeopardy because they were for shooting at a motor vehicle resulting in great bodily harm and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. Even though the child's firing of the weapon at or from the vehicle resulted in great bodily harm, the State was not required to prove that the child had the intent to injure the victim. It was possible to commit the aggravated battery, even with a deadly weapon, without the use of a vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's amenability findings were reversed and remanded for the child to be resentenced. The child's convictions for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and shooting at or from a motor vehicle resulting in great bodily harm were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's motion for a new trial or remittitur. The Court of Appeals of New Mexico found substantial evidence to support the verdict and held that the jury's award of damages was not excessive. Plaintiff suffered severe pain after the injury. He was hospitalized, received surgery, and continued to experience pain. Expert witnesses testified on plaintiff's behalf, and the evidence showed that his income declined after the injury. The jury was permitted to consider future pain and suffering and economic damages. By failing to object during closing arguments, defendant failed to preserve any error concerning alleged improper statements by plaintiff's counsel.

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress as the arresting officer illegally seized him without reasonable suspicion or probable cause. The appellate court disagreed and held that the arresting officer legally asserted his authority to effectuate an investigatory detention. As defendant's flight was unprovoked and occurred after the officer made his presence known by activating his lights, the district court properly factored defendant's flight into its reasonable-suspicion analysis. The officer reasonably believed the minivan might have been stolen or that the occupants were trying to run from something, get away for some reason. The officer witnessed the minivan plow through several cars and come to a stop, and the occupants get out and flee. Evidence of defendant's flight, the evolving circumstances witnessed by the officer, the officer's beliefs based on 10 years of experience, and the fact that defendant's behavior would not be considered by a reasonable layperson to be merely innocuous or innocent provided the requisite reasonable suspicion to stop and detain defendant for purposes of investigating the incident.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer observed defendant's truck drift over the &quot;fog line&quot; for sixty to seventy yards and initiated a traffic stop. She was charged with failure to maintain a lane in violation of Albuquerque, N.M., Traffic Code &sect; 8-2-1-42 (1974). Defendant hired an attorney to represent her. When the attorney interviewed the arresting officer, he appeared irritated, insulted the attorney and made obscene gestures. The attorney withdrew representation. Defendant claimed the officer's conduct deprived her of her right to counsel of her choice. The Court of Appeals of New Mexico held that the evidence was insufficient to establish a Sixth Amendment violation. The officer's conduct did not have a demonstrable impact on counsel's ability to represent defendant or upon the outcome of the case. The Court of Appeals also upheld the ordinance against defendant's constitutional challenges. A plain reading of section 8-2-1-42 alerted a person of common intelligence that a vehicle must stay within the marked boundaries; the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 30-18-1, -9 (2007) imposed a criminal penalty on acts related to cockfighting. The district court held that plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge the statute. The Court of Appeals of New Mexico agreed in part. The individual plaintiffs did not demonstrate a connection between constitutional protections and the alleged injury, and the business plaintiffs failed to establish a constitutional interest in continuing to engage in their business activities. Spectator plaintiffs did not have standing, as the dogfighting ban did not impose a criminal penalty on spectators. However, the gamefowl association had associational standing, because the statute was germane to the organization's purpose. Plaintiffs did not allege any Mexican law that protected the culturally bound uses of personal property; therefore, N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 5 did not render the statutory ban on cockfighting unconstitutional. Plaintiffs failed to establish a Fifth Amendment taking, because the ban on cockfighting was not a direct appropriation of property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the District Court of Otero County (New Mexico), which convicted him of aggravated stalking in violation of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-3A-3.1 (1997).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his conduct was insufficient to support a charge of aggravated stalking, and that testimony regarding statements he made to the police prior to and after his arrest should have been suppressed because he was not read his Miranda rights. Upon review, the court held that because the violation of the restraining order was done in a threatening manner, was intended to place the victim in fear, and was a part of an established pattern of stalking behavior, aggravated stalking charges were proper. Furthermore, the aggravated stalking statute was not unconstitutionally vague because the prosecutor's decision to charge defendant did not require any arbitrary discretion. In addition, defendant's rights pursuant to Miranda were not violated because certain statements at issue were made prior to defendant's having been in custody. Although the statement that he made while being fingerprinted that he would be booked for murder if he did not forget about the victim was improperly admitted under Miranda, the court held that the admission was harmless error because it was merely a cumulative statement that repeated his earlier undisputed threats to harm the victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee partnership sought review of the adoption of a zoning plan by appellant, the City Council of the City of Albuquerque, New Mexico. The partnership claimed damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for a taking. The jury found for the partnership on both claims. The takings verdict was dismissed under the election of remedies. The appellate court reversed. The Supreme Court of New Mexico reversed and remanded the case to the appellate court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City adopted the 1995 Uptown Sector Plan, which affected property leased by the partnership. The City failed to provide the partnership a meaningful opportunity to be heard before an impartial tribunal, prior to implementing the piecemeal downzone. When the partnership filed a claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 against the City, the issue was whether the partnership had a property interest that required due process protection. The Court of Appeals of New Mexico agreed with the trial court and held that the partnership had a state-created property interest in continued zoning in the face of downzoning unless the City could justify a zoning change as required by Resolution 270-1980. Accordingly, the partnership did establish a Section 1983 claim. The partnership put on sufficient evidence to support the assessment of damages. As Section 1983 and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 did not permit post-judgment interest in an action against a political subdivision, the trial court improperly assessed interest. N.M. R. Ann. 1-054(D)(2) and Section 1988 permitted the award of copy costs, subpoena fees, transcript fees, and expert witness fees to the partnership as the prevailing party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Appeals affirmed the jury award of damages in the amount of $ 8,349,095 to the partnership on its Section 1983 claim; reversed the award of post-judgment interest; and affirmed the trial court's award of attorney fees and costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court of Chaves County (New Mexico) that convicted him of intimidation of a witness under N.M.

Ann. &sect; 30-24-3(A)(2) (1997), arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction and that the district court erred in relying upon a conviction from another jurisdiction during habitual offender sentencing under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-18-17(D) (2003).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested following an altercation with his wife. He was charged with aggravated battery on a household member and was subsequently charged with intimidating a witness. Although defendant pled guilty to the former charge, he went to trial on the latter. At trial, defendant's wife testified that defendant was aware that he might go to jail because of the assault, was afraid of having to go to jail, and threatened to kill her if she testified against him. On review, the court held that the wife's testimony was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for the intimidation of a witness. However, the district court's reliance upon a three-page judgment that simply stated a name similar to defendant's name and nothing else was unreasonable to support a conclusion that defendant was the same person named in the Texas judgment of conviction. Without the fingerprint card to which the State had access and testimony from a fingerprint expert establishing that defendant's fingerprints matched those of the person named in the judgment, the State failed to make a prima facie showing of defendant's alleged Texas conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed, but his sentence was vacated, and the case was remanded for resentencing under the habitual offender statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant worker sought review of a compensation order issued by the New Mexico Workers' Compensation Administration (WCA) granting only partial relief in his claim alleging that appellees, a corporation owning a casino and a Native American Indian tribe (Tribe), terminated him in retaliation for the employee having filed a workers' compensation claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker challenged the aspect of the order that did not require that he be issued a necessary employment license, as wells as the adequacy of the remedies and cost-sharing provisions established in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 52-1-28.1, -28.2, and.54(F) (2003). The court held that the immunity of tribal entities was possessed independently by each entity. Furthermore, although the Tribe's gaming commission and the Tribe, itself, were immune, the corporation, which was owned by the Tribe, had waived its sovereign immunity. Given the mandatory language of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52-1-28.2(B), the seriousness of the public policy at issue, and the conclusiveness of the finding by a workers' compensation judge that the worker's termination was retaliatory, the court found that the corporation had to rehire the worker. Aside from the worker's bare assertions that the fee splitting and fee cap provision of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52-1-54 rendered the attorney fees award provision unfair and unjust, the worker had equally failed to adequately explain how the fee splitting provision in connection with the attorney fee cap was not rationally related to the purposes of the State of New Mexico's objectives.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the portion of the WCA order that did not require the corporation to rehire the employee, and affirmed the remainder of the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Believing that the protections of the Medical Malpractice Act were not afforded to the doctor because his insurance coverage had lapsed, the patient filed suit.

After the Commission issued a decision in favor of the doctor, the patient filed a second suit. Subsequently, she voluntarily dismissed her second complaint and moved to reinstate the original. On review of the order of reinstatement, the court held that the trial court properly interpreted the order dismissing the first case as a dismissal solely for the purpose of permitting the patient to pursue a hearing before the Commission and properly concluded that the original complaint remained valid for statute of limitations purpose because its interpretation was based upon the very language of the order of dismissal itself. Because there was no justice in construing the order of dismissal as barring the patient's complaint, the trial court did not err in finding that the patient's complaint was not barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner husband sought review of an order from the District Court of Sandoval County (New Mexico), which divided property and debt in a divorce action against respondent wife, who died during the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife were in the process of a divorce when the wife died. The wife's parents were substituted for the wife. The trial court allocated the property of the couple, determined and divided the community debt, and ordered that the marital residence be sold in order to satisfy the debt of the community. On appeal, the court concluded that under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-4-20(B) (1993), the trial court properly continued the division of marital property after the wife's death as if both parties had survived. Further, under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45-3-703(E) (1975), the wife's parents, as personal representatives of her estate, had the same standing to be sued as did the wife during her life. The parents succeeded to the wife's interest. The trial court had jurisdiction to divide the marital estate between the husband and the parents. Finally, because repatriation and funeral expenses were incurred after the wife's death, those debts could not be considered as community debt under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-3-11(D) (1995) and were to be considered the wife's separate debt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case to the trial court to recalculate the community debt absent the repatriation and funeral expenses that were incurred after the wife's death and to further assess the need to sell the marital residence in order to satisfy the remaining community debt. The trial court could also reallocate the community property, if necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant downloaded pornographic images of children while using a computer at his place of employment.

The district court's dismissal of the manufacturing count was contrary to express definitions and plain language of the Sexual Exploitation of Children Act. The Court of Appeals of New Mexico held that the copying of digital images to a portable storage device created a new digital copy of the prohibited image sufficient to constitute manufacturing under N.M.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband appealed from adverse rulings in an over-seven-year, bitterly fought marital dissolution. The appellate court remanded in regard to the husband's right to receive accountings and relating to his right to review documents and information underlying the special master reports. The appellate court further remanded on an issue relating to attorney fees but affirmed on all other issues. The appellate court saw no jurisdictional bar to the district court's ongoing attempt to wind up the property issues and to arrive at the wife's share of the community estate. Therefore, the district court had jurisdiction to establish a specific $338,000 amount as the wife's community share. The appellate court remanded to address the issues of whether, and if so, in what manner, the wife properly and adequately accounted to the husband. The district court was also to address whether and to what extent the husband was entitled to accounting from the wife. The district court did not err in denying the husband's claims of exemption under N.M. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An interlocutory appeal was certified from the District Court of Rio Arriba County (New Mexico), which had decided that the deferential standard of review set out in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 73-2-21(E) (2003) was unconstitutional on its face in appellant water rights owners' consolidated appeals from decisions of appellees, the commissioners of two different acequias, denying the owners' requests to change the use of their water rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioners had denied the owners' requests to change the use of the water rights because, inter alia, such a transfer would divert water from its traditional uses for irrigation to other uses. The issue was whether the deferential standard of review set out in &sect; 73-2-21(E) conflicted with either N.M. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 5 or the equal protection clause of N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 18. On interlocutory appeal, the court reversed and remanded. While art. XVI, &sect; 5 was alleged to provide a de novo hearing from a decision in matters related to water rights, even assuming that acequias were state executive bodies within the provision, a de novo proceeding was not mandated as a different manner of district court review on appeal was otherwise provided by law in &sect; 73-2-21(E). The deferential standard of review did not violate the equal protection clause of art. II, &sect; 18 as the right of access to the courts and the right to appeal were not significantly impacted. Therefore, rational basis, rather than intermediate scrutiny, review applied as &sect; 73-2-21(E) was general social and economic legislation that did not affect a fundamental or important constitutional right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's decision and remanded for further proceedings under the appropriate statutory standard of review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The representative was the personal representative of her son's estate, who was 19 years old when he died. In the wrongful-death case the jury awarded the representative $ 2,957,000 in compensatory damages, which was reduced to based on a finding that the decedent was 35 percent negligent. The jury also awarded punitive damages. The appellate court affirmed. To the extent that a comment might have been improperly construed as an argument that the corporation failed to take any corrective action after the accident, the instruction to disregard all arguments making any such suggestion was sufficient. Further, the corporation's conduct was sufficiently reckless to support a substantial award of punitive damages. The corporation knew that there was a hazard of someone colliding with the wellhead, knew that if that happened serious bodily harm or death could result, knew that the well site was in a highly traveled area, knew that erecting a barricade or fence would prevent the hazard, and still chose not to do so. As a result, when the decedent accidentally backed his car into the corporation's unprotected wellhead, the wellhead exploded, and he burned to death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant City of Albuquerque appealed a judgment of the District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico) entering a declaratory judgment and permanent injunction, under the Declaratory Judgment Act, N.M.

Ann. &sect;&sect; 44-6-1 to 44-6-15 (1975), prohibiting the enforcement of a City ordinance as to plaintiff mentally ill persons, in a suit also brought by plaintiff mental health protection and advocacy group.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged city ordinance provided for assisted outpatient treatment for mentally ill persons. The court first held that the mentally ill persons demonstrated standing to challenge the ordinance and that the district court properly denied the City's motion to dismiss for lack of standing, under N.M. R. Ann. 1-012(B)(1). Given a credible threat of application of the ordinance, the individual mentally ill persons sufficiently demonstrated standing to challenge the ordinance. The mental health protection and advocacy group, an agency under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 10801 et seq., also had standing to advance the claims of its constituents. The court also agreed with the district court that the ordinance was in direct conflict and preempted by the State Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code (Code), N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 43-1-1 to 43-1-25 (2007), and the Mental Health Care Treatment Decisions Act (Act), N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 24-7B-1 to 24-7B-16 (2006). In enacting the ordinance, the City exceeded the power granted to it under N.M. Const. art. X, &sect; 6. The beneficial purpose of the ordinance could not override the Code or Act, which were general laws applicable throughout the State.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that plaintiffs had standing and affirmed the district court's declaratory judgment and permanent injunction prohibiting the enforcement of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer also sold service contracts to its customers who bought computers, and the taxpayer negotiated with a third party to provide in-home service repairs on the computers. The taxpayer argued that sales occurred in Texas, not New Mexico. The court disagreed, holding that the destination principle applied. The presence of the third-party support contractor established a substantial nexus with New Mexico, and the contractor's activities were significantly associated with the taxpayer's ability to establish and maintain a market for its computer products, so the tax did not violate the Commerce Clause. The court also held that the taxpayer's distribution of catalogs constituted taxable use under the compensating tax provision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dog owners sought to have HEART declared unconstitutional on numerous grounds. The court first held that the dog owners had standing because they alleged an adequate threat of imminent injury resulting from the sterilization provisions and from the unreasonable provisions regarding the housing and restraining of animals. The dog owners contended that HEART imposed an impermissible excise tax because the City collected fees that were unreasonably in excess of the cost of regulation. The court agreed that the dog owners sufficiently pleaded a cause of action under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-18-2(D) (1980) and N.M. Const. art. X, &sect; 6(D) to survive the City's N.M. R. Ann. 1-012(B)(6) motion to dismiss on this issue. The dog owners contended that required sterilization of animals was a compensable taking because breeders would lose a commercially viable use for their animals. The court held that, absent the concrete factual background of an enforcement action by the City, the takings claim was theoretical and premature. Regarding the claim that HEART impacted interstate commerce, the court held that the dog owners could present further evidence on remand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the motion to dismiss with respect to the excise tax and the interstate commerce claims and remanded for further development of the factual record.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the victim was allegedly shot by defendant in defendant's home, police officer's obtained a search warrant for the home. Two days before the adjudicatory hearing was to begin, defendant moved to suppress the evidence seized in her home on the ground that the search was unconstitutional because the warrant did not expressly authorize a nighttime search. On appeal of the trial court's decision denying the motion to suppress as untimely under N.M. R. Ann. 5-212 and 10-103.1, the court affirmed. The court held that an evidentiary hearing was necessary to decide the motion to suppress to determine whether the magistrate issuing the search warrant had authorized a nighttime search as required by N.M. R. Ann. 5-211(B). However, because defendant prejudicially delayed the filing of the motion to suppress and did not request or propose a reasonable, practical alternative for an evidentiary hearing, she was not denied her constitutional right to a hearing on her motion.</SPAN></P>

Defendant entered his plea from jail via a two-way, real time, audio-visual connection with the courtroom. On appeal, the court held that magistrate court violate the mandates of N.M. R. Ann. 6-502, 6-110A when it accepted defendant's no contest plea by audio-visual communication because N.M. R. Ann. 6-502, by requiring a magistrate judge to address a defendant in open court when accepting a no contest plea, did not permit the acceptance of such a plea by audio-visual communication. Therefore, N.M. R. Ann. 6-110A which allowed a defendant to appear via audio-visual communication did not including a no contest plea proceeding. The magistrate also failed to obtain defendant's waiver of his right to appear in person to enter his plea. Because the State failed to prove that the error was harmless, the district court erred by denying defendant's motion to withdraw his plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico) of fourteen felony offenses dealing with criminal sexual penetration and contact of his half-sister, along with two counts of kidnaping. Defendant, who spoke only Vietnamese, appealed on the grounds that his translator was &quot;borrowed&quot; by the court to translate for a Vietnamese juror.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that several distinct constitutional rights were violated by the use of a single translator to translate both for him and for a Vietnamese juror, including his rights to due process, to confront witnesses against him, and to effective assistance of counsel because his ability to consult with his attorney was adversely affected. The court found that defendant showed no prejudice. The interpreter provided translations of all statements by witnesses, the court, and the attorneys. Defendant could stop the trial at any point to have the interpreter translate any discussions he wanted to have with counsel or vice versa. In fact, defendant availed himself of this procedure before counsel cross-examined the victim. The principles of preservation and the doctrine of invited error provided additional rationale for rejecting defendant's claim of error. Counsel was not ineffective for refusing to object to using a single interpreter because the procedure did not adversely impact any rights of defendant, nor result in any prejudice.</SPAN></P>

The plea agreement stated that defendant was to be sentenced to 364 days in the county jail with none suspended.

After the magistrate judge sentenced defendant to 364 &quot;mandatory&quot; days in jail, he filed a motion to eliminate the word &quot;mandatory&quot; or rescind the plea agreement. The district court correctly granted the motion. The district judge found that the basis of the bargain was that defendant be allowed to earn good time and ordered the magistrate judge to strike the word &quot;mandatory&quot; from the judgment and sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted, before the District Court of Lea County, New Mexico, of receiving stolen property (retention). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for receiving stolen property was based on findings that defendant kept stolen firearms. Defendant's second conviction for receiving stolen property was based on findings that he kept stolen DVDs, camera equipment, and gym bags. Defendant argued that his convictions for receiving stolen property violated the prohibition against double jeopardy. The relevant inquiry was whether the receiving stolen property statute provided for separate units of prosecution, and it was immaterial whether the statute's title references the fact that the offenses therein had penalties. Defendant further argued that separate punishments would have been merited only if the receiving stolen property statute expressly provided that the generic and firearm offenses were separate. The structure of the larceny statute, which was a similar statute, unambiguously defined the unit of prosecution based on the nature of the things taken, recognizing the categories of generic property as distinct from the category of firearms. The appellate court concluded that it could discern a legislative intent to create a separate offense within the receiving stolen property statute for firearms.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Taos County, New Mexico, entered a decree of foreclosure in favor of plaintiff complainant on her motion to partially satisfy defendant homeowner's judgment debt. The homeowner filed a claim of exemptions on execution form in the district court. The homeowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted that the complainant raised her foreclosure claim in a motion in the original tort claim. Her failure to institute a separate foreclosure action was not procedurally defective. N.M. R. Ann. 1-065.1 did not apply to the homeowner's case because it applied to writs of execution obtained from the clerk of the court and executed by the sheriff. Foreclosure was a distinct procedure available to a judgment creditor to satisfy a judgment lien. The homeowner knew of his right to claim exemptions because he claimed them in accordance with N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39-4-15. The homeowner failed to timely appeal from the decree of foreclosure. If the appellate court were to permit the homeowner to file a later claim for exemption after the district court's decree of foreclosure, it would compromise the efficiency of the foreclosure procedure and would afford the homeowner the opportunity to manipulate the process in order to seek an advantage. Even though the complainant had not filed the transcript of judgment with the county clerk at the time she filed her motion for foreclosure, her subsequent filing created the record for the district court's finding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer stopped defendant for failing to signal a right turn at a green light. Defendant was the arrested for DWI. The officer testified at trial that he was mistaken about the law regarding a failure to signal under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-7-325(A). Defendant's motion to suppress evidence was granted, and the State filed an appeal. In affirming, the appellate court determined that an investigative stop had to be controlled by reasonable suspicion, pursuant to N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 10 and the Fourth Amendment. The appellate court declined to hold that a reasonable, but mistaken, belief that a traffic offense had occurred created reasonable suspicion for a valid traffic stop. Under New Mexico case law, conduct premised totally on a mistake of law was unable to create the reasonable suspicion needed to make a traffic stop. However, if the facts articulated by the officer supported reasonable suspicion on another basis, then the stop could have been upheld. Here, there were no other such facts because the officer's vehicle did not constitute other traffic affected by the failure to signal, and there was no other traffic on the road at the time of the stop.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in magistrate court with aggravated DWI, failure to maintain a traffic lane, and impeding traffic. When he filed a motion to suppress evidence, the State filed a nolle prosequi and filed the same charges in district court. The district court did not err by denying defendant's motion to dismiss the charges based on the expiration of the six-month rule. A new six-month period began to run when the State filed a nolle prosequi and refiled in district court. Defendant's conviction of DWI was based on substantial evidence. Defendant smelled of alcohol and admitted drinking; he showed signs of intoxication during the field sobriety tests, including that he swayed, he did not follow the officer's instructions on any of the tests, he lifted his arms away from his side during the one-leg stand test, and he failed to maintain the stance during the walk-and-turn test.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant grandmother challenged a decision from the District Court of Sierra County (New Mexico), which dismissed her claims for visitation with a minor child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was taken into the custody of appellee New Mexico Children, Youth, and Families Department (CYFD) upon an abuse and neglect petition concerning the mother and the grandmother. The grandmother did not object when the child was adjudicated as abused and neglected. The mother relinquished her parental rights, and the child was adopted. The grandmother was not allowed visitation, and she was dismissed from the child's case. This appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court held that the grandmother's appeal from the order of dismissal was timely. Next, the arbitrary and capricious standard applied because the district court was reviewing a discretionary act by the CYFD under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32A-4-25(H)(6). The grandmother was not entitled to unfettered visitation; visitation was not in the child's best interest under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32A-4-22(E). The CYFD provided services in an attempt to preserve and reunify the family, and the grandmother was afforded adequate due process. The grandmother did not request an open adoption, and she did not establish the prejudice prong of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Finally, other issues presented were not briefed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A metropolitan court convicted defendant of aggravated driving while under the influence (DWI) and speeding. The District Court of Bernalillo County, New Mexico, affirmed defendant's convictions in an on-record appeal. Defendant again appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the metropolitan court abused its discretion in determining that the 182-day rule under former N.M. R. Ann. 7-506(E) was not violated, and impermissibly penalized him for exercising his right to a jury trial. The supreme court found the State's motion to amend was properly granted as defendant was provided notice that the State had proof that he had a prior DWI, and defendant did not challenge the State's proof or otherwise contest the appropriateness of the amendment. And when defendant claimed that he needed further information in the form of transcripts in order to proceed, the metropolitan court acted within its discretion by granting defendant a continuance to prepare for a jury trial instead of a bench trial. However, the metropolitan court improperly exercised a blanket policy of immediately remanding to custody those defendants who chose to go to trial and were convicted while allowing those defendants who chose to plead guilty to remain out of custody pending sentencing. These actions could have been construed as impermissibly punishing defendant for exercising his constitutional rights to plead not guilty, to a jury trial, and to appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the New Mexico State Engineer, sought review of an order from the District Court of Socorro County (New Mexico), which, in a proceeding that commenced when appellee water users filed a petition for writ of certiorari pursuant to N.M. R. Ann. 1-075, found that certain water management regulations were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court treated the proceeding as a Rule 1-075 proceeding without objection. The State Engineer did not seek certiorari review of the district court's order pursuant to N.M. R. Ann. 12-505(C) but instead filed a notice of appeal, along with a motion requesting an extension of time to file a certiorari petition if necessary and a clarification of the process for an appeal in such cases. The court observed that N.M. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 5 required a de novo standard of review in water rights administrative appeals and that Rule 1-075 did not provide for de novo review; thus, the water users should not have proceeded under Rule 1-075. The appeal process in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-7-1 (1971) did not apply to the adoption of regulations, and N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-2-16 (1973) provided only for a hearing and did not create a right of appeal. Concluding that the water users should have sought a declaratory judgment under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-6-13 (1975), the court construed the proceeding below as an exercise of the district court's original jurisdiction under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-6-2 (1975), as to which the State Engineer's notice of appeal was proper under N.M. R. Ann. 12-201(A)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court allowed the State Engineer to appeal the district court's final judgment and order.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court concluded that defendant's sentence violated his right to a jury trial.

Rather, he stipulated to the facts relevant to the elements of the crimes to which he pled. Defendant could not stipulate to the facts relevant to sentencing enhancement at the time of his plea hearing because he did not know that any admissions in the plea agreement were relevant to sentencing enhancement. At the time defendant entered his plea, he was not informed of his right to a jury determination of facts that would support enhancement of his sentence. The record did not reveal that defendant was informed of acts that would be sufficient to constitute aggravating factors. Defendant's waiver of his right to a jury trial in the plea agreement was not a voluntary and intelligent waiver of his right to a jury trial on the sentence enhancement factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision from the District Court of Lincoln County (New Mexico), which convicted him of one count of forgery, one count of fraud over $20,000, and two counts of conspiracy. The State also appealed form the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had another woman pose as his wife in order to obtain a home refinancing. The house was awarded to the wife in a divorce judgment, and defendant was charged after the refinancing scheme was revealed. After he was convicted, this appeal followed. In partially affirming, the appellate court determined that defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy was violated when he was convicted of two counts of conspiracy. There was only one agreement to break the law in this case. Next, the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for fraud over $20,000 under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-16-6 (2006) and N.M. R. Ann. 14-1640. The fact that the loan was secured by community property did not have an effect on the &quot;belongs to another&quot; element of fraud. Even if the loan or line of credit did belong to defendant, defendant lost such at the time the divorce decree was filed. Finally, the district court did not err by dismissing two of the forgery counts against defendant on double jeopardy grounds. Under the unit of prosecution analysis, the appellate court held that the New Mexico Legislature only intended one conviction for forgery related to this case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One conspiracy conviction was reversed. The judgment was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff developer brought an inverse condemnation action under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42A-1-29 against defendant city. The District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico) awarded the developer damages for lost profits and additional construction costs. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer's construction of a hotel was delayed for 142 days because encroaching city waterlines had to be relocated. The appellate court upheld most of the additional construction costs award because those costs were directly related to the interruption of the construction project and would not have been incurred but for the city's interference with the developer's use of the property. With respect to the cost of a buttress wall that had been built in a effort to mitigate damages, the developer would have to demonstrate, on remand, the reasonableness of its mitigation effort in light of the general damages award. On the issue of lost profits, the city argued for a fair rental value approach for the period of the taking, while the developer favored a full tort measure of damages. Instead, the appellate court concluded that the determination would have to be made on remand based on what an objective property owner would accept to delay construction of a hotel facility under the circumstances for a period of 142 days. Denial of an attorney fees award to the developer was not an abuse of discretion because it was not shown that the city deliberately misplaced its waterlines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court: (1) affirmed the district court's measure of damages for excess construction costs, except for the cost of the buttress wall; (2) remanded that portion of the award for reconsideration; (3) reversed the district court's award of lost profits and remanded for reconsideration; (4) vacated the district court's grant of costs, and (5) affirmed the denial of attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2005, appellee New Mexico Water Quality Control Commission (WQCC) amended the water quality standard defining &quot;surface waters of the State.&quot; Appellant companies appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies argued that they were entities that were adversely affected or represented persons that had been adversely affected by the WQCC's adoption of the 2005 definition of surface waters of the State because they and their members owned and operated facilities and properties where there were areas where water sometimes accumulated or flowed on the surface of the earth. The appellate court noted that the reasons for amending the definition of surface waters of the State given by the WQCC in its Statement of Reasons were supported by substantial evidence in the record. The companies' speculation about hypothetical newly covered waters did not meet their burden of demonstrating the invalidity of the WQCC standards. The 2005 amendment insured that any future contraction of federal Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C.S. &sect;&nbsp;1251, jurisdiction would not affect the WQCC's subject matter jurisdiction. The 2005 definition of surface waters provided persons of reasonable intelligence with constitutionally adequate notice of what waters were subject to regulation as State surface waters. The WQCC did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in adopting a definition of surface waters of the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Bernalillo County, New Mexico, issued a permanent injunction enjoining defendant city from enforcing Albuquerque, N.M., Ordinance Bill No. O-05-113 (ordinance). The trial court determined that the ordinance was unconstitutional and denied various motions filed by the city, including a motion to dismiss the case due to lack of standing by plaintiffs, ACLU and its executive director. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that they had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the ordinance under requirements for traditional standing, organizational standing, facial constitutional challenge of the ordinance, and the doctrine of great public importance. The appellate court found that plaintiffs did not demonstrate that they suffered an injury in fact or that they were in imminent harm of suffering an injury in fact due to the ordinance. The ordinance had not been applied to any particular individual. Plaintiffs did not demonstrate that, based on the ordinance, ACLU members suffered an injury in fact or the imminent threat of an injury in fact. Thus, plaintiffs would not have standing to sue in their own right. An overbreadth challenge was permitted when First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association were implicated. First Amendment rights were not implicated by the ordinance; therefore, plaintiffs had no standing to bring a claim that the ordinance was overbroad. The case involved nothing more than a potential violation of certain specific citizens' due process rights, and therefore did not rise to the level of a clear threat to the essential nature of government.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the permanent injunction against the city was dissolved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff purchaser challenged a decision from the District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico), which stayed his class action complaint against defendant seller and compelled arbitration on the claims of breach of contract, breach of express and implied warranty, unjust enrichment, unfair trade practices, false advertising, and equitable and declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchaser bought a computer from the seller via its website. Due to dissatisfaction with the computer's memory, the purchaser filed a class action suit. The seller's motion to compel arbitration was granted, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court found that Texas law applied to the determination of whether there was a valid agreement to arbitrate because it was the state chosen in the contract. Moreover, the public policy of New Mexico was not violated. Next, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55-2-207 (1961) did not apply to this case because it did not address the formation of a contract, and it did not specify which additional terms could have become a part of a contract involving a non-merchant. The buyer agreed to the terms and conditions of the sale when he failed to return the computer. Next, the arbitration agreement was not unenforceable as either procedurally or substantively unconscionable. The failure to permit class arbitration also did not make the arbitration agreement unconscionable. The agreement was not unconstitutional as a violation of the right to a jury trial. Finally, an argument that the contract was illusory was not preserved for review.</SPAN></P>

The association and the corporations argued that Congress, in enacting the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), on which the NMOHSA was patterned, did not intend to address injuries inflicted on workers by the criminal acts of third parties. The appellate court disagreed. The appellate court was satisfied that there were substantial numbers of businesses that fit the description of &quot;convenience store&quot; and &quot;convenience goods.&quot; The EIB had authority to adopt the regulations. The legislature's delegation of the authority to the EIB did not violate the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers, and the regulatory definitions of &quot;convenience store&quot; and &quot;convenience goods&quot; were not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand, the District Court of Bernallillo County (New Mexico) originally dismissed an indictment against defendant, finding that the prosecutor had misrepresented the contents statements used to cross-examine defendant. After the State appealed, it moved to dismiss the appeal and reopen the motion hearing. The district court granted the motion, heard more evidence, vacated its dismissal, and ordered a new trial. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court had jurisdiction over the appeal where defendant's convictions had been reversed owing to the prosecutor's improper use of hearsay statements in cross-examining defendant and the district court had granted and then denied defendant's motion to bar a retrial on double jeopardy grounds. The district court lacked jurisdiction to address the State's motion to reopen the hearing as it was directed to the district court's order that was subject to the notice of appeal; it was not collateral to the order. Moreover, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39-1-1 did not controvert the analysis as the State had filed its notice of appeal before its motion to reopen. Thus, the district court had no ability to act on the motion. On the merits of the motion to bar retrial, the prosecutor's actions did not meet the extraordinary standard required to bar reprosecution based on double jeopardy concerns as the questioning was isolated and not reflected in other parts of the trial. Based on the district court's belief that the State would not have benefitted from a mistrial, the prosecutor had not acted in willful disregard of the constraints on his actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's ruling was affirmed. The case was remanded for retrial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, New Mexico Corrections Department officials, appealed from a writ of mandamus that the District Court of San Miguel County (New Mexico) issued in favor of petitioners, county commissioners and an association of counties. The writ of mandamus required the Corrections Department to pay for the costs associated with the confinement of parole violators held in any county detention facility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prior action in which the county sought a declaration that the Corrections Department was responsible for the costs of housing parole violators, the district court held that the claim for a declaratory judgment was barred by sovereign immunity. The county commenced the instant action to obtain a writ compelling the Corrections Department to pay the costs associated with housing parolees. On appeal, the court held that the issuance of the writ of mandamus pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-2-4 was proper because N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 31-18-15(C), 31-21-10(C), 31-20-2(A), 31-21-25(B)(1), and 31-21-14(A) mandated that the Corrections Department retain legal responsibility, including financial responsibility, for a convicted felon, regardless of whether the felon was imprisoned at the state penitentiary, on parole, or rearrested as a parole violator. The court determined that sovereign immunity did not bar the issuance of the writ of mandamus because the mandamus action was not a suit against the state. Res judicata and collateral estoppel did not bar the mandamus action because there was no adjudication of the merits or decision on the ultimate issue in the prior action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's peremptory writ of mandamus and the decision on the petition for writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the litigation in the federal courts, the company refused to pay past due federal royalties and interest for the use of the geothermal resources beneath the company's surface estate that belonged to the United States under 30 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1002 and 1004 of the Geothermal Steam Act. The company subsequently entered into a settlement agreement, in which it agreed, inter alia, not to litigate any issue related to royalties. Later, the company filed a suit in the state district court for an adjudication of all underground water rights in the Animas Valley Underground Water Basin. The company claimed that the litigation in federal courts did not adjudicate the ownership and scope of the company's water rights. Despite the company's efforts to transform the litigation into an adjudication of water rights under state law, the company challenged the ownership of geothermal resources, which federal courts had already determined belonged to the United States. Thus, the state district court correctly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to determine ownership interests of geothermal resources or mineral rights reserved by the United States.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court of Dona Ana County (New Mexico) convicting him of driving while intoxicated (DWI) under N.M. Stat. &sect; 66-8-102(C)(1), (G) (2004).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested at a sobriety roadblock. On appeal, the court held that the fact that the officer deviated from the script provided to him by asking defendant if he had been drinking did not violate defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. At the point the question was asked, the deviation did not change the detention from one of reasonable detention to one of unreasonable detention or require an individualized suspicion of intoxication. The constitutional status of the roadblock remained intact during the brief, minimally intrusive initial contact, and the reasonableness of the initial contact and detention was not diminished by the question about drinking. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's motion to dismiss or exclude a lost videotape of defendant's second set of field sobriety tests because: (1) the evidence of defendant's guilt was strong; (2) whether the second set of tests was indicative of sobriety was overshadowed by the .13 breach alcohol content reading that was taken at the roadblock; (3) the officer did not testify about the second set of tests; and (4) defendant was given carte blanche to cross-examine the officer about the tape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insureds sued defendant insurer, alleging that the insurer breached its contract by charging premiums in the form of service fees that exceeded the total premium specified in their policies. The District Court of Sandoval County (New Mexico) certified the multistate class action. The insurer's application for interlocutory review of the certification decision under N.M. R. Ann. 1-023(F) was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer argued that the district court erred in certifying the class because there were significant differences between the laws of the class states, making it improper to apply New Mexico law to all class members. The district court erred in concluding that New Mexico law applied to all class members because there was no false conflict between the state laws. Thus, New Mexico's statutory definition of premium could not be applied to the insured from other states. The case could not proceed with the district court applying the laws of the various jurisdictions because, in the absence of a false conflict, the district court had to apply the laws of all of the involved jurisdictions in accordance with New Mexico's lex loci contractus rule. Thus, the action failed to meet the requirements of N.M. R. Ann. 1-023 as a matter of law. Finally, the district court was free to address whether the insurer had waived its right to argue on remand or in any subsequent appeal that the class should not have been certified with regard to New Mexico class members.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the certification order that certified the class with regard to proposed plaintiffs from other states was reversed. The action was remanded to proceed on behalf of the class of New Mexico insureds only if the district court believed it was appropriate to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee New Mexico Environment Department petitioned appellee New Mexico Water Quality Control Commission to revise New Mexico's numeric human health standard for uranium in groundwater, pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-6-6(B) (1993); N.M. Code R. 20.6.2.3103(A)(12). The Commission voted to change the numeric standard from 5 mg/L to 0.03 mg/L, pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. 74-6-4(C) (2003). Appellant oil, gas, and mining associations appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Native American group intervened. The Department sought to lower the standard for uranium because of toxic effects on the public's health and particularly because of a high Native American and Hispanic population that was especially susceptible to those effects. The new standard, 0.03 mg/L, was the same as the standard for drinking water of United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The oil, gas, and mining associations insisted the numeric standard for uranium in groundwater was unattainable and economically infeasible when applied to abatement of contamination at uranium mills or mines. The associations contended that the Commission's action was arbitrary and capricious and a violation of New Mexico's Water Quality Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 74-6-1 to -17 (1967, as amended through 2005). Nevertheless, the Commission properly amended the standard pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-6-4(C) (2003), and the Commission acted in accordance with the law. Moreover, credible scientific data existed in the record to support the Commission's action. The Commission considered facts, such as the EPA's standard for drinking water, and the costs of related kidney disease.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a dispute over the adjudication of water rights for a project, appellee irrigation district, conservancy district, and State sought ratification of a settlement agreement among themselves and appellee United States establishing a managed water plan for the Pecos River. Appellant downstream, senior water users objected. The District Court of Chaves County (New Mexico) granted appellees summary judgment. The water users appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The water users argued, inter alia, that the settlement and decree violated N.M. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 2, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-15-19, and N.M. Const. art. IX, &sect; 14. The appellate court presumed the constitutionality of the agreement insofar as it was within and not in violation of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-1-2.4 et seq. (2002). The water users did not overcome that presumption where the agreement, decree, and statute combined to protect senior water rights while also assuring state line delivery compliance. Moreover, the decree served as an adjudication of the irrigation district's surface water rights since the district had agreed to that adjudication, as well as to administration and management of waters as set out in the decree. The water users failed to prove that the settlement violated N.M. Const. art. IX, &sect; 14, as the State was purchasing land and water rights at market value, thus receiving valuable consideration for its expenditure of public funds. The district court did not exceed its authority to approve the settlement given its power under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-4-17. Finally, the water users failed to show any genuine disputes as to whether they were harmed by the settlement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision from the District Court of Otero County (New Mexico), which convicted her of four counts of failure to disclose material facts or a change of circumstances to obtain public assistance, in violation of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-40-1 (1987) (amended 2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly failed to disclose the fact that she received business income while she was living in public housing. She was convicted of four violations of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-40-1 (1987) (amended 2006). This appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the statute was not vague under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution or under N.M. Const. art. II, &sect;&nbsp;18 due to its penalty provisions. The mere room in the statute to allow for charging discretion on the part of the prosecutor did not render it void for vagueness. As long as the statute provided notice of the conduct that it made criminal, a prosecutor was allowed to have discretion to decide the manner in which to charge the criminal acts. Next, the appellate court rejected the argument that the New Mexico Legislature did not intend to criminalize defendant's conduct since the statute related to &quot;public assistance,&quot; and not public housing. Based on the New Mexico Municipal Housing Law, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 3-45-1 to -25 (1965, as amended through 1989), public housing came within the plain an ordinary meaning of &quot;public assistance.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner school district appealed a summary judgment order granted by the District Court of Santa Fe County (New Mexico) to respondent, a public water utility, regarding compensation in a condemnation action filed by the district to condemn a water line extension and associated property, pursuant to the Eminent Domain Code, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42A-1-1 et seq., and the Special Alternative Condemnation Procedures Act, N.M. Stat. &sect; 42-2-1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court disagreed with the school district's assertion that it was entitled to deduct a &quot;contribution in aid of construction&quot; (CIAC) charge from any compensation due to the utility. On review, the court affirmed the summary judgment. The CIAC charge was used for the purpose of setting utility rates, which was not equivalent to the fair market value of the property for purposes of condemnation. Thus, a deduction of the CIAC charge from a condemnation award would result in an unconstitutional taking of property under N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 20. Regardless of the manner in which the utility acquired the property or carried it on its books, the utility had title to the property. Thus, the utility would not receive a &quot;windfall&quot; if the CIAC deduction were not permitted. Finally, the plain language of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42A-1-24(D) clearly indicated that the sum paid by the district as CIAC did not entitle the district to a credit against the total amount awarded to the utility under the Eminent Domain Code. The CIAC was a contractual obligation made so that the district could obtain water service and was not so that the district could take the property by condemnation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation filed an administrative claim for refund of motor transportation fees paid to the Department and the Department partially denied the claim.

The Department brought forth a prima facie case entitling it to summary judgment unless the corporation demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact. The corporation did not argue that it made such a demonstration and thus, the district court did not err in grating summary judgment and dismissing the corporation's complaint for a refund. The district court properly dismissed the complaint for a refund for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the corporation did not file within the period required by &sect; 7-1-26(B)(1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder, and a $300,000 cash-only bond was set. He then sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that N.M. R. Ann. 5-401(B) allowed for the setting of such a bond; it was not written in terms of what defendant's options were in posting a secured bond. The appellate court rejected commentary to the rule, which relied on distinguishable civil cases. Next, such a bond did not violate N.M. Const. art. 11, &sect; 13. The purpose of bail was to secure defendant's appearance and to protect citizens; the primary purpose was not for the protection of the accused. The term &quot;sufficient&quot; gave some discretion to the entity setting bail; a narrow construction of this term was not appropriate. As such, cash-only bonds were appropriate in certain circumstances. Finally, the appellate court noted that the parties did not challenge whether the amount of the bond was appropriate under the facts of this case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an alleged rape, defendant scrubbed up evidence, and he then instructed the victim to wash off in a river. He was convicted of kidnapping and two counts of tampering with evidence. Thereafter, defendant sought review. In reversing, the appellate court determined that defendant was permitted to raise a double jeopardy challenge, even if the issue was not preserved for appellate review. The two convictions for evidence tampering under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-22-5 (2003) violated defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy because he was punished twice for the same offense. Defendant only had one motive; therefore, only one continuous act of tampering occurred. Also, the jury instructions were unclear. Next, defendant's Sixth Amendment rights were not violated by the enhancement for the kidnapping charge under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;31-18-15.1 (1993) because there was no increase in the statutorily-authorized maximum sentence. Finally, the appellate court declined to review the State's challenge to the sentence imposed for tampering because it did not file a cross-appeal under N.M. R. Ann. 12-201, and judicial efficiency did not require review of the issue at any rate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and John Does, appealed the judgment of the District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico) that upheld, as constitutional, aspects of defendant city's sex offender registration ordinance, the Albuquerque Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (ASORNA). The city cross-appealed the court's finding that certain aspects of the ordinance were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ACLU argued that ASORNA was both vague and over broad in its registration requirements. The court of appeals agreed. The inclusion of kidnaping and false imprisonment as convictions requiring registration as a sex offender was not rationally related to the legitimate interest of the city in protecting victims or potential victims of sex offenders. There was no &quot;firm legal rationale&quot; for including offenses with no sexual motivation as &quot;sex offenses.&quot; The hardship imposed on an offender convicted of kidnaping or false imprisonment to be labeled a sex offender, absent any evidence of a sexual motivation for the crime, was great. The city's stated purpose of ASORNA, which was the &quot;protection of the victims and potential victims of sex offenders&quot; was not furthered by the inclusion of crimes that were not sexually motivated. Therefore, the registration provision of ASORNA that required registration for offenders with convictions of kidnaping or false imprisonment, without any sexual component, violated due process and was therefore unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inclusion of kidnaping and false imprisonment absent a sexual motivation for the crimes was over broad and violated due process. The registration provision which allowed the collection of DNA samples and dental imprints was unconstitutional. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought rehearing of the court's prior decision on review by certiorari from a judgment of the District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico), which ruled in favor of appellee partnership in finding that a zoning amendment targeted the partnership's property and resulted in a downzoning. The district court concluded that the partnership's development plan required approval.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court ordered the city to consider the partnership's development plan under the previous sector plan, the 1981 Uptown Sector Plan (81USP). The city did so and denied the development. On appeal, the district court held that the city had not reviewed the development as ordered and concluded that the development had to be approved. In the meantime, the partnership's claim for damages for a violation of constitutional rights in connection with a 1995 plan (95USP) proceeded to a jury trial. A jury awarded the partnership damages in a certain amount. The court reversed the district court's initial conclusion regarding the 95USP because substantial evidence supported the city's conclusion; because the district court's erroneous decision formed the basis for the jury's decisions, those decisions were likewise reversed. The court held that the adoption of the 95USP was a legislative, rather than a quasi-judicial, act; thus, the partnership was not deprived of its due process rights. The amendment was a text amendment; thus, the &quot;change or mistake&quot; rule did not apply. Further, the amendment did not violate the rule of uniformity set forth in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-21-1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court withdrew its prior opinion and substituted the instant opinion in its place. The court reversed the district court's order remanding the cause to the city to consider the site plan under the 81USP. The court also reversed the jury's verdict, which found multiple violations of the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving on a suspended license. During his booking, a detention officer found a syringe of methamphetamine in defendant's wallet. Defendant was charged with possession of methamphetamine and possession of drug paraphernalia. The appellate court held that the custodial arrest violated N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-8-123 (1989) as the State did not justify the custodial arrest by showing that the arrest and detention were mandated by N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-8-122(G) (1985). N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-8-127 (1978) did not absolve the officer of the mandates in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-8-123(A) (1989). The custodial arrest was unreasonable under N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 10, which was broader than the Fourth Amendment. Although the offense was a jailable offense, the officer had to decide when making a traffic stop whether the violation required citation and release or custodial arrest. Probable cause was not the sole factor to be applied in the constitutional inquiry. Under a balance-of-interests standard, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-8-123 (1989) reflected an intent to protect individual liberty over perceived governmental need. The suppression motion should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the birth parents' motion to dismiss the adoption petition and their request to withdraw their consents and entered a final decree of adoption.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a group, an organization, and business owners, appealed a decision of the District Court of Santa Fe County, New Mexico, which ruled that Santa Fe, N.M., Wage Requirements: Minimum Wage Payment Requirements, ch. XXVIII, &sect; 1.5 (2003) enacted by defendant city was within the power of the city to enact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance mandated certain city-based businesses to pay a minimum wage higher than the state and federal minimum hourly wage. The city was a home rule municipality under the Municipal Charter Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-16-1 to -18 (1965) and N.M. Const. art. X, &sect; 6(C). The court held that the Minimum Wage Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 50-4-19 to -30 (1955, as amended through 2003), was a general law and that it did not expressly deny the city's power to enact the ordinance. Also the ordinance was a private law governing civil relationships within the meaning of the home rule amendment. There clearly was a public purpose in a minimum wage protecting the general welfare of the community. Further, the ordinance was complementary to the Act. As to Equal Protection, because the ordinance did not restrict plaintiffs' ability to exercise an important right and plaintiffs were not part of a sensitive class, rational basis scrutiny applied. It was apparent that minimum wage legislation served a legitimate government purpose. Also the wage regulation did not appear to be a restriction on the use of private property because plaintiffs could continue to use their businesses as they wished.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers contended that they were entitled to a refund of certain taxes because they were unconstitutional. They filed a class action suit to obtain a refund. The district court refused to certify the class under N.M. R. Ann. &sect; 1-023(A)(1) based on a failure to meet the numerosity requirement. The district court failed to include certain proposed class members who had not exhausted their administrative remedies. The taxpayers then sought review. In reversing, the court determined that including the taxpayers who had not exhausted their administrative remedies as to the contested taxes in the putative class was consistent with the purposes of the exhaustion requirement under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-1-22. Requiring each taxpayer to file a separate claim would have been futile, and the fact that the named taxpayers had filed claims was sufficient to satisfy the exhaustion requirement for the absent class members. The court was unable to determine from the record if the same analysis applied to the claims for a refund of uncontested taxes. Finally, &sect; 7-1-22 was not construed as a waiver of sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and father were no longer in a relationship when the child was born. Due to the mother's odd behavior, the New Mexico Children, Youth, and Families Department was notified. Thereafter, the district adjudicated the minor child abused and neglected. Both parents then sought review. On appeal, the court sustained the finding as to the mother. First, the mother had an opportunity to demonstrate her parenting skills with the other children that had been removed from her custody. Further, her conduct during visitation showed that she was unable to care for the child. The mother was unable to effectively parent due to her mental disorder and incapacity, which constituted neglect under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32A-4-2(E)(4) (1999). However, expert testimony regarding the father's ability was not reliable since he was not observed with the child. The father had no other children, and it was speculative to find that he allowed the grandmother to care for the child while impaired. There was also no evidence of violence, despite his past criminal convictions. Finally, the New Mexico Abuse and Neglect Act was not unconstitutionally vague, and it did not violate the Eighth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the finding of abuse and neglect as to the mother, but reversed the finding as to the father.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker did not file his claim until sometime after suffering the heart attack. Initially, he was not aware that he had suffered the attack at work. The WCJ found that the attack did not arise out of the course of employment. The appellate court divided the issues presented into three topics: (1) health care providers; (2) causal link between the heart attack and employment; and (3) violation of constitutional rights. As to the choice of health care providers, even though the employer had denied the worker's claim, the employer still had a right to select the health care provider. As to the link between the heart attack and employment, the WCJ was presented with conflicting testimony. The WCJ opted to believe the testimony of the employer's expert who opined that the heart attack was caused by smoking, diabetes, and risky behavior. Finally, the worker maintained that he was denied constitutional rights, but nothing supported the worker's claim that he was denied a fair trial. There was no evidence that the WCJ held the worker to a higher standard. The worker provided no support for his contention that the Worker's Compensation Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the District Court of Valencia County (New Mexico) found defendant guilty of the second degree murder of his estranged wife and tampering with evidence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant called police to report his wife's alleged suicide. The factual finding that the police unconstitutionally searched defendant's home was not the only one rationally supported by the record. On the contrary, the facts indicated that defendant called the police reporting the alleged suicide and that he might have consented to their presence in his home. Because a finding that the police illegally searched defendant's home was not the only one rationally supported by the record, there was no plain error. Also, the record indicated that defendant's trial counsel believed defendant had consented to the entry of police into his home. Because defendant apparently called the police to report his wife's suicide and let them in when they arrived, the appellate court could not determine from the record the extent of defendant's consent or the time the police needed to obtain a warrant. Further, defendant failed to state with any specificity which evidence, if any, police collected prior to obtaining the warrant. Thus, defendant's allegation of prejudice amounted to a mere assertion. Therefore, the appellate court rejected defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the school board ended the teacher's employment prior to the expiration of her contract, the teacher was &quot;discharged&quot; as defined in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-10A-2(A). N.M. Stat. Ann.&nbsp;&sect; 22-10A-27(A) provided that a certified school employee could be discharged only for just cause, and N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-10A-2(F) defined just cause as a reason related to an employee's competence, turpitude, or job performance. The school board did not challenge the arbitrator's finding that the teacher never received any negative reports about her competence, turpitude, or job performance. On appeal, the court held that a reduction in force did not constitute just cause as defined in &sect; 22-10A-2(F). Although the teacher's form contract provided that the contract could be cancelled due to a reduction in force, the provisions of the form contract that conflicted with the Act were void and unenforceable because the model form contract was promulgated by the state board of education and the state board of education did not have authority to promulgate a regulation that conflicted with a statute. There was no public policy requiring the court to depart from the plain language of the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver argued that he had the right to withdraw his guilty plea to the traffic offense because the officer did not advise him that he could appear and request a deferral of the prosecution or a deferred sentence. The trial court granted the driver's mandamus petition. On appeal, the MVD argued that it had no clear duty to return the traffic citation to the metropolitan court for trial because the officer told the driver about his two choices, the driver chose one, and the statutes, such as N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 66-8-117 and 66-8-123, did not allow him to change his mind. Also, the driver had an adequate remedy at law in that he could appeal his license suspension if he did not pay the fine. The court noted the legislature had provided a streamlined method of handling minor traffic violations and had not made provisions for drivers having second thoughts about whether it was wise to plead guilty. The court held that given the relatively minor consequences involved to the drivers and the potential disruption of smoothly working procedures, the driver's due process rights were not violated and mandamus was not appropriate unless a plea was made under duress or some like circumstance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner was granted a building permit to construct a permanent helipad. Thereafter, the city adopted Albuquerque, N.M. Ordinance O-73, which restricted the use of helicopters to certain zones only. While the legislation was pending, the owner's building permit was revoked. Thereafter, both decisions were appealed by the owner. The district court entered judgment in favor of the city, and the owner sought review. On appeal, the court determined that the owner's use of the helicopter was a nonconforming use, which was not subject to immediate termination. The city was permitted to regulate the use of helicopters when it found that they had potential adverse impacts on the health, safety, and welfare of the users and surrounding property. Next, the court held that the city's action was not quasi-judicial because the restrictions were applicable to all properties and future helicopter use in the city. However, the court noted that the district court failed to conduct a proper balancing analysis when it set the amortization period. Finally, the decision to revoke the permit was not moot. The city was not allowed to revoke the permit so as to remove the owner's right to amortization.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the adoption of the ordinance, but it found that the one-year amortization period was not reasonable.

Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14-2-1 to -12 (1947), against appellee New Mexico Department of Taxation and Revenue. Appellants sought records relating to severance taxes paid on oil and gas wells located in the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The key request was for complete electronic copies of the Department's severance tax database and any updates or corrections to that database for appellants' commercial use. The trial court held that appellants' request was governed by N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14-3-15.1(C)(1)-(5) (1995) of the New Mexico Public Records Act, and not the IPRA. It determined that, while the records requested were public records, the format in which the records were requested and the frequency with which they were requested to be supplied separated them from the broader application of the IPRA. In affirming, the court found that appellants had not provided any authority forbidding a state legislature from granting a state protection for its electronic databases. Nor had appellants supplied any authority that would forbid a State as a condition to supplying a copy of a database from charging a reasonable fee or royalty for its use. Thus, the trial court did not err in its interpretation and application of &sect; 14-3-15.1(C)(1)-(5) or in its holding that, pursuant to &sect; 14-3-15.1(C), the Department correctly denied appellants a copy of the electronic database and the continuing updates that appellants requested.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's probation officer arrested him for violating a condition of probation and an intensive supervision program agreement-- consuming alcohol. The officer found car keys during a pat down search. Though defendant denied driving to the probation office, another probation officer found that the keys unlocked a vehicle in the parking lot that defendant admitted was his. Officers found cocaine in the vehicle. The appellate court held that the warrantless arrest and searches were reasonable under the Fourth Amendment and N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 10. The warrantless arrest for a probation violation was constitutionally sufficient whether or not it was shown, under N.M. Prob. &amp; Parole Div. Admin. Regs. 215.1, that there was a risk to public or individual safety or a serious or repeated pattern of violations. The patdown search was lawful as it was incident to a valid arrest. Assuming without deciding that matching the key to defendant's vehicle was a &quot;search,&quot; it was reasonable because (1) the intrusion was minimal, and (2) his status as a probationer substantially reduced his expectation of privacy as to the door lock of his vehicle. He failed to preserve his Miranda argument.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Bernalillo County, New Mexico, convicted defendant of child abuse. He was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment. The State's request for aggravation was denied, but the offense was found to qualify as a serious violent offense. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended, inter alia, that: the jury was not properly instructed on negligent child abuse; an acquittal on intentional child abuse and subsequent prosecution for negligent abuse violated double jeopardy; and there was insufficient evidence for the conviction. The appellate court found that since the definitions for criminal negligence and reckless disregard were incorporated into the jury instruction, the jury could not have convicted defendant under a lesser civil standard. Thus, the tendered jury instructions were legally sufficient. No double jeopardy violation occurred, as the two crimes required different statutory elements. The jury could have found that defendant did not intend to shake the baby in a violent manner, but failed to reach a verdict on whether he shook the baby in a criminally negligent, albeit violent manner. Hence, collateral estoppel principles did not apply. Although defendant offered several innocent explanations, the medical witnesses found his explanations were medically unacceptable. He also admitted shaking the victim on two occasions. This evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of criminally negligent child abuse.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant grandmother sought, and succeeded, in getting visitation rights to her grandchild. After appellee father was determined to be the sole custodial parent, he sought to terminate the grandmother's visitation. The District Court of Santa Fe County, New Mexico, found that the change in legal custody was a material change in circumstances and granted the father's motion to terminate the grandmother's visitation. The grandmother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the grandmother contended the trial court misapplied the law, the change in the custody arrangement did not constitute a showing of good cause under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-9-3(A) of New Mexico's Grandparent's Visitation Privileges Act (GVA), N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-9-1 to -4 (1993, as amended through 1999), and the trial court erred when it terminated the existing court-ordered visitation without an evidentiary hearing. The appellate court found that while there was a presumption that fit parents acted in the best interests of their children, the burden was not shifted away from the father who sought to modify an existing order granting grandparent visitation. Giving the father's determination &quot;special weight&quot; was different than insulating his determination from any court intervention whatsoever. Consequently, the trial court erred when it perfunctorily deferred to the father in the matter of visitation. Contrary to the father's contentions, the GVA was not facially unconstitutional and judicial intervention was not prohibited when a parent refused grandparent visitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order terminating the grandmother's visitation was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether it would be in the child's best interests to continue visitation with the grandmother, and whether a guardian ad litem should be appointed for the child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner, individually and as trustee of a testamentary trust, appealed from an order of the District Court of Taos County (New Mexico), which dismissed the owner's action alleging estoppel and inverse condemnation with respect to defendant town's termination of the owner's completion of an apartment complex and the town's denial of the owner's request for a special use permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town stopped completion of the owner's apartment complex, claiming that the approvals and permits issued for the project were based on the owner's misstatement of acreage, which created impermissible density. The town thereafter denied the owner a special use permit, which prompted her to bring the instant action. The trial court granted the town's motion to dismiss the action pursuant to N.M. R. Ann. 1-012(B)(6) (2004). On appeal, the court found that dismissal was improper. The owner had no obligation to appeal the town council's denial of a special use permit in order to bring the instant action under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39-1-1.1 and N.M. R. Ann. 1-074. The issues of whether the town should be estopped to enforce its density regulation, and whether the town was liable in inverse condemnation, assuming that the owner could prove that she had a vested right to complete the project, were not barred. The fact that the owner sought the special use permit was merely an attempt to reach an administrative resolution before proceeding to court. However, the denial of that permit request was not binding on the trial court's determination as to the causes of action presented.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded the matter to the trial court for reinstatement of the owner's complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant owned a tattoo and body piercing shop. She offered free nipple piercings to anyone who was willing to sit in a store window while having their nipples pierced in full view of the public. One customer was a man.

On appeal, defendant argued that the city ordinance prohibiting public nudity violated the state's Equal Rights Amendment, N. M. Const. art. II, &sect; 18, as well as N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28-1-2(H) (2003). The appellate court disagreed. The district court in this case properly took judicial notice that the female breast is different from the male breast. The ordinance's classification was properly based on a unique characteristic. The appellate court also rejected defendant's argument that she was discriminating against women in violation of the New Mexico Human Rights Act by complying with Albuquerque, N.M., City Ordinance ch. 46, &sect; 11-8-2. Finally, defendant asserted that she was engaged in a form of expression and communication.

Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 29-11A-1 to -8 (1999, as amended through 2000). He also sought specific performance of his plea agreement, asserting that the State agreed that he would not be required to register. The Court of Appeals of New Mexico held that SORNA did not violate either the federal or state ex post facto clause, did not violate either the federal or the state due process clause, and did not violate N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 34. Defendant was not entitled to enforce his plea agreement in the manner he sought.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with committing three felonies and one misdemeanor. The court made an explicit finding that he was indigent. An attorney with the Public Defender Department (Department) was appointed to represent him. However, his private counsel agreed to represent him pro bono. The State and defendant stipulated, and the district court ordered, that defendant was indigent and was entitled to all services, including waivers of fees and costs, normally provided by the State of New Mexico to an indigent defendant. Counsel determined that expert witnesses were necessary. The Department, however, refused to provide funds for expert assistance in defending defendant on the ground that expert fees were not paid by the Department on behalf of an indigent defendant unless he was represented by the Department or an attorney on contract with the Department. The trial court denied defendant's motion seeking an order for funds from any appropriate source to hire necessary experts. The appellate court did not perceive a conflict of interest that would deprive defendant of his rights if he were required to become a client of the Department in order to access expert witness services.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cross-appeals were taken from orders of the District Court of Rio Arriba and Santa Fe Counties (New Mexico), which, in consolidated child pornography cases, dismissed some counts of the indictments and refused to dismiss others.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a father and his adult daughter, were artists, photographers, and nudists. On several occasions, defendants took photos of the daughter's minor siblings while the children were nude or partially clothed. Defendants moved to dismiss all charges, claiming that the photos had artistic value or were taken for private family purposes and were not lewd. The trial court concluded that some of the photos were not lewd as a matter of law, but that a jury question existed as to others. The court analyzed the free speech issue under N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 17 and held that only the most insufferable sexually explicit material could be deemed obscene for purposes of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-6A-2. The court stated that photographs of nudist children engaged in typical childhood activities were not obscene. Because the content of each photo had to be considered, however, the lower court erred in dismissing certain counts on the ground that they involved family photos. Dismissal was required under &sect; 30-6A-2(A)(5) as to photos that did not show the genitals and pubic area of the children. Counts based on certain photos that showed the genitals and pubic area were not subject to dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of counts based on photos that were not obscene as a matter of law, affirmed the refusal to dismiss counts based on certain photos that showed the genitals and pubic area of the children, and reversed in part as to other counts. The court affirmed the dismissal of child abuse charges and the refusal to dismiss criminal sexual contact charges; these issues, not briefed on appeal, were deemed abandoned.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's motion for directed verdict was denied, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying his motion for directed verdict and in admitting certain evidence. The appellate court found that, because the permit at issue was technically not in effect, there was insufficient evidence to support the charges. Though it was impossible for defendant to violate the terms of the permit because the permit had expired, he acted as though the permit was still in effect. Because the jury found him guilty of everything that was required to commit the crime, including defendant's belief that the permit was valid, defendant was necessarily guilty of attempt to commit the offenses. Defendant was not prejudiced by the failure to include attempt in the indictment or the State's failure to argue it at trial. The appellate court also held that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-6-10.2(B) (1993) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied. Further, the trial court did not err in refusing defendant's proffered jury instructions, because they did not accurately state the law. Any error in admitting the complained of lab reports was harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were reversed and remanded to the trial court for resentencing on the lesser-included offense of attempting to commit the violations of the statute. All other issues were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The opponent argued that the Department did not consider regional planning or the &quot;social impact&quot; of the landfill on the neighboring community and that the Solid Waste Act required the Department to do so. The court disagreed, emphasizing that the Act never mentioned &quot;social impact&quot; or &quot;social well-being.&quot; Moreover, such an interpretation was unworkable and unreasonable, as the role of the Department was to pass judgment on the technical aspects of a solid waste site. Broader political and sociological concerns were more appropriate for consideration by the legislature. Even if the hearing officer curtailed some evidence on these issues, the opponent had a sufficient opportunity to present its evidence and arguments. The Act also did not require the Department to consider regional planning. The hearing officer did not abuse her discretion in denying a continuance after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Although a witness was unable to testify in person, the opponent did not demonstrate a denial of due process. The officer's limitations on her consideration of certain testimony and attempts to conduct the hearing in a professional manner did not constitute bias.</SPAN></P>

The District Court of Santa Fe County, New Mexico, held that insofar as the covenants excluded the manufactured home, they were not reasonable and should not, in equity, be enforced and denied injunctive relief. The association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The covenants for the subdivision provided that no trailer shall at any time be used as a residence. The association had always allowed conventional homes which were not built on site, but the covenants had been changed. The homeowners acquired the land, from the previous owners, who had voted in favor of the covenants' amendments. When the home was delivered, the neighbors complained that the home did not comply with the covenants. At issue on appeal was whether the reasonableness of pre-existing, validly enacted, unambiguous covenants that did not violate public policy, statutory, or constitutional provisions might be considered when enforcing such covenants by injunctive relief. The appellate court determined that a general inquiry into whether restrictive covenants running with the land was reasonable was not a proper inquiry. The trial court abused its discretion. The character of the interest to be protected, and the adequacy of an injunction, weighed in favor of the association. Also, the practicality of granting the order of judgment, and the relative hardship likely to result to the homeowners weighed in favor of the association.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-18-15(A)(2) and (4) (1999). The district court denied defendant's motion to bar retrial on second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit second-degree murder. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and an accomplice were accused of killing a victim during a robbery. The evidence showed that the accomplice actually killed the victim. Defendant was charged with an open count of murder and conspiracy to commit murder, in addition to the robbery counts. The jury was instructed that it could find defendant guilty of felony murder or second-degree murder or not guilty, with the same alternatives offered for the corresponding conspiracy count. The jury deadlocked on the murder and murder conspiracy counts. The appellate court found that defendant's sentence violated Apprendi because &sect; 31-18-15(A)(2) and (4) required a finding that defendant's crime resulted in death, but the jury failed to find defendant directly responsible for the victim's death. There was no double enhancement, however, in finding aggravating circumstances under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-18-15.1. The district court improperly limited defendant's good time credit for the robbery conspiracy conviction, which was not listed under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33-2-34 (1999). There was an adequate factual basis for ordering retrial for second-degree murder and conspiracy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three defendants were charged in two separate cases with violating N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 58-13B-39, and they filed a motion to dismiss the charges, arguing that prosecution was barred by N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 15 and N.M. Stat.

The District Court of Curry County (New Mexico) and the District Court of Otero County (New Mexico) dismissed the charges, and the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Acting Director of the New Mexico Securities Division entered administrative orders in two cases that imposed a fine on three defendants, after a hearing officer found that defendants violated the New Mexico Securities Act of 1986, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 58-13B-1 to 58-13B-57 (1986, as amended through 1999). In one case, the Acting Director's order was overturned by a court, and, in the other case, defendants declared bankruptcy, and the Division made no effort to collect the fine. After the Acting Director entered his orders, defendants were charged with violating N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 58-13B-39, based on the same conduct that led to the Acting Director's orders imposing a fine, and they moved to dismiss the charges, arguing that prosecution was barred by N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 15 and N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-1-10 (1963). The appellate court held that criminal prosecution under the Securities Act, following administratively imposed civil penalties under the Act, did not place defendants in double jeopardy under N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 15 or N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-1-10 (1963), and the trial courts erred by dismissing the charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Santa Fe County, New Mexico, granted defendant's, a juvenile, motion to dismiss, on the grounds that defendant was incompetent to stand trial. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defense counsel presented evidence that defendant's brain injury caused serious mental deficiencies that rendered him permanently incompetent to stand trial. The State claimed that the trial court erred when it dismissed the petition pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32A-2-21(G) (1995). The State argued that the trial court should have stayed the proceedings under N.M. R. Ann. 10-221(D) (2003). The appellate court found that the trial court did not lack authority under &sect; 32A-2-21(G) to rid defendant of criminal charges and determine the status of the case. Where the trial court found that defendant was likely incapable of being treated to competency, the statute was a substantive enactment, and Rule 10-221(D) was directed at the procedure for determining where the child stood as to treatment options. The rule allowed the legislature to address the fate of a child who would never become competent to stand trial. The trial court could dismiss without prejudice. If the State feared defendant may harm others, it could institute civil commitment proceedings and even seek immediate admission of defendant to residential treatment under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32A-6-13(L).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant workers challenged orders of the Workers' Compensation Judge (WCJ) denying their applications for supplementary compensation orders. The court considered whether the Workers' Compensation Act (WCA), N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 52-1-41 (1999), 52-1-42 (1990), violated the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions and whether the same provisions violated the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 12101-12213.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The WCJ entered compensation orders awarding temporary total disability benefits to the workers for injuries that resulted in temporary total disability due to a psychological response to odors and dust. The workers moved for supplementary compensation orders, arguing that, as the court upheld the award of temporary total disability benefits and did not limit them, the workers were due more than the 100 weeks of benefits, as the WCJ's original order was ongoing. The threshold inquiry of the equal protection analysis was whether the statute in question, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 52-1-41(B), 52-1-42(A)(3), resulted in dissimilar treatment of similarly situated workers. The court held that it did, but that the disparity was rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. The WCA created an objective standard that promoted predictability and certainty of benefit determination resulting in efficient delivery of benefits. There was no authority that directly addressed their argument that, in a workers' compensation scheme, persons with disabilities due to mental impairment could not be treated differently under the ADA than persons with disabilities due to physical impairments.</SPAN></P>

At a hearing held pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-9-1.5, the trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress statements made after each reading of her Miranda rights.

She also argued that the procedural process in &sect; 31-9-1.5, which resulted in her being held in a secure, locked facility for 15 years, violated her constitutional right to due process. The instant court held, as a matter of law, that defendant was incompetent to knowingly and intelligently waive her constitutional rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient contended that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-5-13 of the Medical Malpractice Act, N.M. Stat.

The appellate court found that a claim filed after the three-year &sect; 41-5-13 deadline was barred where adequate time remained under the statute, after discovery of fraudulent concealment of an act of malpractice, to file a claim by exercising ordinary diligence. The measurement was whether the patient had adequate time, exercising ordinary diligence, to file the action within the stricture of the Act's occurrence rule. The legislature also intended to permit delay while the matter was submitted to the Medical Review Commission, with a view toward limiting the time within which a plaintiff could pursue a cause of action. The legislature specifically chose to insulate qualified health care providers from the much greater liability exposure that would flow from a discovery-based accrual date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff private museum appealed from two orders of the District Court of Santa Fe County, New Mexico, denying its protest of defendant County of Santa Fe's assessment of property tax, claiming an exemption under N.M. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3, and dismissing its complaint under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-38-40(A) (1982) for a refund of the tax which was paid under protest upon the county's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the tax was assessed, the museum's tax exempt status under I.R.C. &sect; 501(c)(3) was immaterial. In the denying the protest, the County's board did not mention the requirement that the property's use under N.M. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3, embrace systematic instruction in any and all branches of learning, and made no finding on the requirement that a substantial public benefit be derived. N.M. Admin.

That the property was used to raise funds for operations and related programs and activities in schools or off-site did not detract from its educational use and purpose. Because the board did not consider the unique circumstances of a museum, the case was remanded for a further board hearing on the extent of any intrinsic educational value the museum provided and of the relationship of off-site activities to the museum. Showing that funds the museum donated were actually used for educational purposes could assist in obtaining an exemption. The appellate court was bound by N.M. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee State moved to terminate appellant mother's parental rights on the grounds her child was neglected or abused. The District Court of Eddy County (New Mexico) found the mother's continuing substance abuse problems, and other aggravating factors, were grounds for terminating the mother's parental rights. The mother appealed, asserting her plea of no contest to abuse and neglect was involuntary, and that trial counsel was ineffective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1998, the mother's parental rights to her first two children were terminated due to her drug abuse. Later, the mother served a sentence for forging checks to obtain money to buy drugs. She was paroled, and almost immediately got pregnant with the child at issue. The mother's parole was revoked. She was released from prison and began using drugs again. After a drug binge, the mother gave birth to the child in the instant case. The child was born with cocaine in his system, the mother was rearrested, and was returned to prison. The primary issue on appeal concerned N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 32A-4-2(C), 32A-4-22(C), and 32A-4-28(B). Under the latter statutes, efforts at reunification could be deemed unnecessary by the trial court, if parental rights to a child's sibling had been previously terminated, aggravating circumstances existed, and efforts at reunification appeared futile. The appellate court noted that the latter statutes were in conformity with federal law, and held the statutes were constitutional facially, and as applied to the mother.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Bernalillo County, New Mexico, dismissed a burglary charge filed against defendant. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that defendant had adequate notice of the crime under the United States and New Mexico Constitutions. The appellate court found that the burglary statute,&nbsp;N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-16-3 (1971), applied to defendant's conduct since he was caught stealing articles from the store. The notice simply told defendant that he would be trespassing if he came onto the store's property ever again. The store revoked any authority that defendant might otherwise have had to enter the property as a member of the public. The notice did not have any other effect, other than to revoke defendant's permission to enter the store. A burglary was an unauthorized entry into a structure with the intent to commit a felony or theft therein. Defendant knew that he was not authorized to enter the store. Thus, his entry for the purpose of committing shoplifting (a theft) was a burglary. There was more involved than defendant simply going into the store. There was no misrepresentation. There was no suggestion that defendant re-entered the store and shoplifted knowing that he would only be prosecuted for trespassing.</SPAN></P>

The worker appealed from a New Mexico Workers' Compensation Judge's orders awarding him medical benefits and attorney fees, and imposing bad faith sanctions against his employer and insurer. He argued he should have been awarded additional relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker suffered a back injury while employed with his employer. After he underwent surgery and reached maximum medical improvement, he filed a complaint for benefits under the Workers' Compensation Act (Act). A compensation order awarded him permanent partial disability benefits and attorney fees. He continued to receive medical treatment pursuant to the Act. Later, he suffered injuries to his neck and right shoulder. His employer's insurer initially denied authorization for back surgery, advising the worker that he would first have to attend an independent medical exam (IME) with a panel of specialists. The IME was scheduled, but three days ahead of it, an orthopedic specialist evaluated his injuries, ordered a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and instructed him not to travel to the IME until he stabilized. His benefits were suspended because of the delay in the IME. The WCJ found the insurer had engaged in bad faith conduct, but did not order the insurer to pay all of the worker's attorney fees, so he appealed. The appellate court held that the attorney fees should have been awarded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed in all respects except for the issue of payment of attorney fees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the parents divorced, the father and the child lived with the grandparents for several years. Then, the relationship between the father and the grandparents deteriorated. The district court granted the grandparents' request for visitation privileges under the GVA, &sect; 40-9-1 to -4. In a subsequent action, the mother, who was not involved in the previous action, moved to intervene, and both the father and the mother sought to strike the district court's visitation order. The district court denied the motions and issued a new order, in which it, again, granted visitation privileges to the grandparents. The appellate court found that the district court made a number of specific findings in support of the visitation order: (1) the grandparents provided primary care for the majority of the child's life; (2) the grandparents stood in the role and relationship of loco parentis; and (3) the grandparents would comply with the father's restrictions regarding medication, religious activities, and health evaluations for the child. Also, the district court made reasonable efforts to include the mother in the process, once her concerns surfaced, and it did not have to start from scratch.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Chaves County District Court, New Mexico, denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence of contraband found in defendant's car and convicted defendant, pursuant to a conditional plea of no contest, of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, possession of drug paraphernalia, and improper use of motor vehicle registration. Defendant appealed the denial of his motion to suppress and his convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer opened the driver's door of defendant's car to check for a secondary vehicle identification number (VIN) and noticed contraband in plain view. Defendant argued that the act of opening his car door to look for a secondary VIN constituted an unreasonable search of his car without probable cause and violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 10. The instant court concluded that it was reasonable for the officer to open the car door to attempt to verify the primary VIN. The officer knew before opening the door that the license plate was not registered to the vehicle in question, and he knew that defendant did not have a driver's license or registration certificate. There was nothing with which to compare the primary VIN obtained from the dashboard. The officer had far more evidence before him to give rise to an objectively reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. The instant court rejected defendant's contention that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-3-507(B) (1978) articulated a legislative policy in favor of greater protection to a driver under the state constitution than under the federal constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Sandoval County, New Mexico, granted summary judgment in favor of defendant sheriff in plaintiff driver's action claiming a due process deprivation against the sheriff because she was not given a hearing on the validity of the decision to have the vehicle towed. The driver appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff moved for summary judgment declaring that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-7-350 (1978), was constitutional, which was granted. The driver argued that the towing statute was unconstitutional because it contained no provision to satisfy the due process requirements of notice of towing and opportunity to be heard on the lawfulness of the towing. The appellate court found that the tow order initiated the immediate deprivation of the vehicle and that deprivation continued with the fee requirement for the vehicle's release, implicating the right to due process no less than the initial towing. The government had to provide a hearing to allow the vehicle's owner an opportunity to challenge the legality of the towing. Without notice and a meaningful and timely hearing, the towing and continued deprivation of use of the vehicle was a deprivation of property without due process of law. The fact that law enforcement officers had the authority to tow a vehicle in an emergency situation for the safety of the traveling public did not eliminate the need for due process. The sheriff had no authority to negate a towing company's statutory lien and to order release of the vehicle.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with larceny and conspiracy to commit larceny. He filed a motion to suppress evidence found as a result of a search warrant. The District Court of Chaves County, New Mexico, denied the motion. Defendant pleaded guilty, and he appealed from the denial of his motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the denial of his motion to suppress evidence seized based on two search warrants authorizing a nighttime search of a truck and an apartment. Defendant argued that the search was unconstitutional because the State failed to establish a sufficient basis for justifying the execution of the search warrants at night. The court of appeals held that the nighttime search was conducted on people who were observed to be active in the nighttime. It was based on probable and reasonable cause that had just recently been developed in the nighttime. This was not a case in which the police developed probable cause during business hours and then waited until nighttime to execute the warrant. The intrusiveness of the nighttime search here was considerably lessened because of the instant circumstances, making the showing of necessity sufficient under constitutional scrutiny. Therefore, the search warrant affidavits contained an adequate showing of reasonable cause to support the magistrate judge's issuance of the nighttime search warrants. As such, there was no violation of defendant's constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of attempted third degree criminal sexual contact of a minor (CSCM) in the District Court Of Sandoval County (New Mexico). Defendant appealed on grounds of double jeopardy and insufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant grabbed the child's hand and pulled it toward his groin twice in a single episode. The appellate court noted that repeated touching of a minor's groin area with no intervening event aside from the minor's pushing the perpetrator's hand away was a single ongoing attempt to reach the minor's private parts. Thus, one of defendant's convictions could not stand as in violation of double jeopardy. The appellate court also held the proof was insufficient that defendant was able to exercise undue influence over the child and use his position of authority to force her to submit to sexual contact. The child, twice within moments forcibly resisted sexual contact by pulling her hands back from defendant's grip and no sexual contact occurred. Moreover, the district court did not set out the initiatory crime of attempt in the jury instructions in a manner to insure all elements of the underlying crime of third degree criminal sexual contact of a minor were properly placed within the context of the initiatory crime of attempt. Had the jury been properly instructed, the jury would have been on solid grounds to convict defendant of attempt to commit CSCM (position of authority).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's attempted CSCM (position of authority) in the third degree convictions were reversed. However, because there was sufficient evidence, and the jury was properly instructed on the lesser-included offense of attempted criminal sexual contact of a minor in the fourth degree, the appellate court remanded the case to the district court to enter a judgment against defendant on one count of the lesser-included offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of five counts of accessory to criminal sexual penetration (CSP), two counts of battery, and one count of intimidation of a witness, in the District Court, Grant County (New Mexico). The trial court found defendant to be a youthful offender not amenable to treatment and sentenced him to 47.5 years' incarceration. He appealed his accessory to CSP convictions and youthful offender status.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two juvenile runaways from Tennessee ended up in a juvenile detention center in New Mexico assigned to the same cell. At first things went well, but the atmosphere changed. Defendant, his co-defendant, and his friend began harassing them. They told the runaways to either clean their cells for them or perform fellatio on them. The runaways refused. Defendant threatened that if they did not perform fellatio on his co-defendant and his friend, they would have to do everyone in the jail, and threatened to kill them. Defendant's co-defendant also threatened to kill them or shove a broomstick up their butts. They complied, and were forced to perform fellatio on four boys. Construing the definition of youthful offender in the context of the children's code and the law of accessory liability, the appellate court concluded that juveniles adjudicated as accessories to CSP were to be punished as adults. Defendant made no claim that the requirements for an adult sentence were not met. There was sufficient evidence to support three of defendant's convictions for accessory to CSP. Defendant had no legal basis for his claim of double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of defendant's conviction as an accessory was reversed, all remaining convictions were affirmed, and the case was remand for re-sentencing consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

The Second Judicial District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico) affirmed his conviction for a per se violation of the DWI statute,&nbsp;N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-8-102(C). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction based on breath alcohol concentration (BAC) tests that were not administered until 1 hour and 31 minutes after he finished driving and yielded results of 0.09/0.09. The appellate court found corroborative evidence to establish a nexus between defendant's BAC test results and the time he was driving. Evidence supported a reasonable jury inference that defendant's BAC level at the time of driving was likely higher, not lower, than the 0.09 recorded later. Defendant's erratic and incriminating behavior of extending his hands and car keys out the window when stopped by police went beyond the usual evidence of slurred speech, bloodshot eyes, and smelling of alcohol. Defendant then gave the officers a false name in an attempt to conceal his identity. The appellate court found that jury could have interpreted these actions as evincing a consciousness of guilt on defendant's part. Defendant performed unsatisfactorily on the field sobriety tests. The appellate court found that admission of an officer's testimony about defendant's performance on the one-legged stand test did not rise to plain error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant police officer, appealed his conviction for voluntary manslaughter, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon (a firearm), and shooting at a motor vehicle resulting in injury. He argued that the District Court of San Miguel County (New Mexico) erred by, inter alia, failing to instruct the jury on an essential element of shooting at a motor vehicle, and refusing to instruct the jury on justifiable homicide by a police officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his partner were involved in a high speed chase. At one point, they blocked the truck they were pursuing, causing it to collide with the police car. When the driver of the truck backed away from the police car, defendant fired shots into the car, killing the driver. The State's theory at trial was that defendant shot the driver to prevent him from escaping. Defendant testified he believed at the time of the shooting that the truck was being used as a deadly weapon to attack him and his partner, that their lives were in danger, and that he was therefore justified in using deadly force in self-defense and defense of another. The appellate court concluded that defendant was entitled to have the jury instructed on justifiable homicide by a police officer in accordance with N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-2-6 (1989) and reversed defendant's convictions. Defendant submitted sufficient evidence to warrant a jury instruction on justifiable homicide by a police officer. A reasonable jury, if it believed defendant's version, could have concluded that defendant was justified in using deadly force to protect himself and his partner. The trial court's error was not harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment and sentence of the district court was reversed, and the matter was remanded with instructions that defendant be granted a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, was convicted of brutally and repeatedly sexually abusing his six year younger stepsister over a two-year period and sentenced to a 91.5 year adult sentence by the District Court, Otero County, (New Mexico). He appealed, arguing the sentence was cruel and unusual and that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant was charged, the State noticed its intent to invoke adult sanctions. After a plea hearing, where defendant was advised he could be sentenced as an adult for 185 years, he pled no contest to all charges, with the trial court retaining jurisdiction over sentencing. The trial court, after hearing defendant was devoid of conscience and empathy, and the State did not have a program that offered any hope of protecting the public, if he were released at age 21, imposed consecutive adult sentences, a total of 108 years. The appellate court concluded the trial court erred by imposing adult sanctions for acts committed when he was 14 and remanded for resentencing. The trial court resentenced for 91.5 years, rejected his motion for reconsideration, and he appealed. The sentence was intended as a means of protecting the public in the face of considerable testimony demonstrating he was not amenable to treatment, and, as a result, would remain a threat to society after he reached the age of majority. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to set aside his plea; the record did not support his contention that it contemplated an illegal sentence.</SPAN></P>

In the interval between the two breath tests taken by defendant, the breathalyzer machine registered .000 on an automatic calibration check. The check should have yielded a reading of between .07 and .09. The State put on evidence that the machine was properly calibrated within one week of defendant's test and that the reading did not affect the test's reliability. The appellate court held that the reliability of the test went to the weight of evidence and was to be resolved by the fact finder. The officer's testimony that defendant failed the HGN test was not prejudicial, even though test did not meet standard of reliability, as trial court immediately offered a curative instruction and other evidence existed to convict defendant of the charged crime.</SPAN></P>

The judge had to find either an intent to do serious harm or knowledge that defendant's acts were reasonably likely to result in serious harm in order for an offense listed in N.M. Stat.

The legislature wanted to reserve the serious violent offenses for those found by the trial judge to be committed in a physically violent manner either with an intent to do serious harm or with recklessness in the face of knowledge that one's acts were reasonably likely to result in serious harm. The statutory factor of actual &quot;resulting harm&quot; could be considered in determining a defendant's intent.

The patient filed her original complaint two days before the expiration of the statute of limitations, and on the same day, filed an application with the medical review commission.

The physician's argued that, because the patient filed her medical review commission application and her complaint at the same time, her original complaint was void, and that the amended complaint could not relate back, because the original complaint was void. The court ruled that a decision by the commission was not a jurisdictional prerequisite to the filing of a complaint in court against a qualified health care provider for medical malpractice. The premature filing of the patient's original complaint was not a jurisdictional defect, and the court rejected the physicians' argument that the complaint was a nullity. The first amended complaint related back to the date of the original complaint, and the patient's claims were filed before the statute of limitations expired.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By applying the 1.1 percent royalty rate in a licensing agreement, appellee New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department determined that appellant, a wholly owned subsidiary of a national retail chain that owned and managed trademarks previously developed by the chain, earned royalty income and assessed gross receipts taxes in the amount of $ 478,099. A hearing officer affirmed the department's imposition of the taxes and the subsidiary appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subsidiary challenged New Mexico's assessment of state income taxes and gross receipts taxes on royalties paid to it by the chain. In affirming both taxes, the Court of Appeals of New Mexico addressed matters of first impression regarding the constitutional limits imposed on New Mexico in its efforts to tax income and gross receipts in light of the physical-presence standard of Quill Corp. v. North Dakota. Inter alia, the subsidiary argued that it did not have the minimum contacts with New Mexico that justified the imposition of any state tax consistent with the Due Process Clause. The court of appeals disagreed. The payment of the 1.1 percent of a specific revenue stream generated in New Mexico gave the subsidiary, as the recipient of a direct pecuniary benefit, a clear stake in New Mexico's consumer market. By allowing its marks to be used in New Mexico to generate income, the subsidiary purposefully availed itself of the benefits of an economic market in the forum state. Thus, New Mexico satisfied the traditional due process standard, which was universally used to evaluate whether an out-of-state business had established and maintained minimum contacts within a taxing state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision and order of the hearing officer upholding the taxes imposed was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Bernalillo County District Court (New Mexico) convicted defendant of two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, one count of conspiracy to commit shooting from a vehicle, and one count of conspiracy to tamper with evidence. The trial court increased defendant's sentence for aggravating factors. Defendant appealed the judgment, although the conspiracy to tamper with evidence conviction was not at issue in this appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that: (1) the evidence was insufficient to support the conspiracy to shoot conviction; (2) conviction and sentencing on the two counts of aggravated assault violated double jeopardy; (3) none of the three reasons given by the trial court for increasing his sentence for aggravating factors was lawful; (4) double jeopardy was violated by using the same facts to convict defendant for aggravated assault, enhance his sentence with the firearm enhancement, and increase the sentence for aggravating factors; (5) failure to submit the aggravating factors to the jury for a determination beyond a reasonable doubt violated defendant's due process rights; (6) allowing two co-defendants to testify against defendant under plea agreements that provided for leniency violated his due process rights; and (7) the verdicts were inconsistent. The instant court found no merit in any of defendant's contentions. The evidence was sufficient to prove defendant's guilt of conspiracy to shoot from a vehicle. It was permissible without offending double jeopardy principles to convict defendant for two counts of assault for pointing a gun at two persons at the same time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant homeowners were named insureds on a title insurance policy issued by the respondent title company. The policy contained a statutorily mandated arbitration provision. When a dispute arose between the title company and homeowners, the title company filed a demand for arbitration. The District Court for Torrance County (New Mexico) denied the homeowner's motion for preliminary injunction and ordered a stay in arbitration pending appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that mandatory arbitration of their claims pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59A-30-4 (1978) violated their constitutional right to trial by jury and that a regulation providing for mandatory arbitration of their statutory causes of action could not override the legislature's provision for judicial determination of those statutory claims. The appellate court agreed. The N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 12 provided that the right of trial by jury as it had existed should be secured to all and remain inviolate. The phrase &quot;as it has heretofore existed&quot; referred to the right to jury trial as it existed in the Territory of New Mexico at the time immediately preceding the adoption of the Constitution. The court's review of early state cases satisfied it that contract actions that sought money damages were routinely tried by juries. The homeowners' could insist on having their common-law claims resolved in a court of law where trial by jury was available. The legislature's specific designation of courts as the proper tribunal for resolution of those statutory claims controlled over any inconsistent forum selection provision imposed by the superintendent of insurance.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a standard adult judgment and sentence. The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court on appeal addressed the authority of a trial court to sentence a juvenile charged with first degree murder, but found guilty of second degree murder, as an adult after holding only a typical adult sentencing hearing. The trial court did not consider the proper factors or make the findings required to be made pursuant to the statute that permitted juveniles found guilty of second degree murder to be sentenced as adults. Defendant was categorized under the Children's Code as a serious youthful offender, having been charged with first degree murder for an offense he committed when he was seventeen years old. However, once the trial court directed a verdict on that charge and once the jury found him guilty only of second degree murder, he was no longer a serious youthful offender. The error went to the entire foundation of defendant's sentence. The sentencing hearing was a sentencing hearing, not the required amenability hearing. The trial court did not make the required findings, either orally or in written form, and the adult sentence was unauthorized under the circumstances. The lack of authorization amounted to fundamental error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, Public Employees Retirement Association (PERA), filed an action in the District Court of Santa Fe County (New Mexico) challenging the constitutionality of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-11-4.2(A) in limiting its ability to recover overpayments made to appellee surviving spouse's deceased wife. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The district court ruled in favor of the surviving husband. PERA appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent had been a member of PERA and was paid disability retirement pension benefits under option &quot;A&quot; from the date of her application, in August 1992, to the date of her death in January 1997. Option &quot;A&quot; did not contain a right of survivorship and was the highest pension payable. As a result, the surviving spouse was only eligible, by operation of law, for the payment of survivor pension benefits under option &quot;C.&quot; However the decedent had been overpaid benefits under Option &quot;A.&quot; PERA argued that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-11-4.2(A)&nbsp;unconstitutionally limited its recovery to only one year of the overpayments made. The appellate court found that &sect; 10-11-4.2(A) did not operate like a statute of limitations or a statute of repose which did not limit liability or ended liability only after a set period of time. Rather, &sect; 10-11-4.2(A) applied retroactively to preclude collection of more than one year of overpayments and could not be applied without diminishing an obligation owed to the State. Therefore the statute was in violation of N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 32, which provided that the legislature could not diminish or release an obligation owing to the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district alleged that the Authority breached a contract by failing to fully indemnify the district for loss from embezzlement. The issue in this case was whether the district could sue the Authority in contract in the trial court. The district argued that the trial court had jurisdiction to entertain a civil action alleging common law breach of contract. The Authority argued that the district's claims were barred by sovereign immunity and that a determination by the trial court of the Authority's coverage obligation would be unconstitutional under the separation of powers doctrine. The instant court agreed with the district, concluding that the Authority was not engaged in legislative or executive policy-making. The trial court had jurisdiction over the district's claim. Because the Authority's decision not to fully indemnify the district was unilateral, the original jurisdiction in the trial court did not violate the separation of powers doctrine. To the extent that the district's other claims sounding in contract and seeking a contract-damages remedy were determined to be legally cognizable, they, too, could be pursued within the trial court's original jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted under the so-called per se section of the DWI statute,&nbsp;N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-8-102(C) (1999). The blood alcohol concentration (BAC) test was administered over two hours after the time of driving, and it yielded only marginal results. Defendant's contemporaneous behavior was unremarkable. The field sobriety tests did not tend to make the alleged fact any more or less probable that defendant had a BAC at or greater than 0.08 at the time he drove his car. The jury was left to speculate about what the BAC might or might not have been at the time defendant drove his vehicle. The State's evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain a guilty verdict for the per se DWI offense. There was substantial evidence before the jury to support a conviction for the driving on divided highways offense as defined in the jury instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for driving on divided highways was affirmed, but his conviction for DWI was reversed.</SPAN></P>

Warrantless entry into the home passed the community caretaker test and was an exception to the Fourth Amendment. The entry did not require probable cause. The jury was properly instructed on the offense of battery upon a police officer. The issue of warrantless entry was not relevant; thus the lesser-included offense instruction was properly refused.

On appeal, he raised four issues. Rejecting his claims, the appellate court affirmed. (1) N.M. Stat.

Based on findings made on the record by the trial court, his sentence was within the applicable range and was constitutional under the Apprendi decision. (2) Defendant failed to preserve for judicial review his challenge to the trial court's findings of aggravating circumstances under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-18-15.1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a youthful offender, entered a plea to second degree murder and tampering with evidence. Appellant challenged the judgment of the District Court of Curry County (New Mexico) imposing an adult sentence on him, and increasing appellant's basic sentence under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-18-15.1 (1993), after finding aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the trial court did not have authority to aggravate appellant's sentence under N.M. Stat.

Ann. &sect; 32A-2-20(D) (1996), while the alterations in the basic sentences allowed by N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-18-15.1 (1993) were discretionary and therefore circumscribed by the Children's Code, N.M. Stat. Ann. ch. 32A, because: (1) the legislature used the phrases &quot;shall be imposed&quot; or &quot;shall be increased&quot; in N.M. Stat.

Ann. &sect; 31-18-15 (1999) was the maximum sentence to which a youthful offender could be sentenced, unless the trial court exercised discretion to impose the mandatory-for-adults sentence enhancements made discretionarily applicable to youthful offenders under N.M.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner obtained a special exception to operate an automobile storage yard. Respondents challenged the validity of that special exception. Discretionary review of agency decisions was constitutionally firm. Nothing in N.M. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2 indicated that an aggrieved party was guaranteed an appeal from the district court acting in its appellate jurisdiction. The district court erroneously concluded that irregularities in the zoning process made the exception void. These deficiencies did not make the decision void, only voidable. The failure to secure the required two-thirds majority vote did not make the decision an ultra vires act. Respondents were required to rectify the deficiencies by perfecting a timely appeal. Resolving the timeliness of respondents' petition turned on which assertion of facts prevailed, but the city council failed to provide a written factual and legal basis for its decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Case was remanded to the city council. Issue of whether respondents challenged the special exception in a timely manner required a factual determination as to when they had constructive notice of the zoning decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor and aggravated battery. The jury convicted him of the contributing charge, but hung on the aggravated battery charge. Defendant appealed. The appellate court rejected defendant's claim that he should have been convicted of the more specific misdemeanor crime of selling or giving alcoholic beverages to a minor. The contributing to the delinquency of a minor by providing liquor law could be charged separately from the underlying violation of the liquor control law because the former charge prohibited the commission of acts by adults that would foster delinquency -- a different goal than the liquor statutes. Based on the evidence, the jury could find that defendant bought the liquor for the minors. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting into evidence a photograph of the victim's slashed face. Defendant abandoned the issue that there was misconduct when the prosecutor argued that defendant was a convicted felon. The contributing to a delinquency of a minor statute was not vague. Also, counsel was not ineffective by tendering a particular jury instruction. Further, there was no cumulative error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was affirmed. Defendant was charged under the proper statute; the evidence supported the conviction; it was not an abuse of discretion to admit a photograph of the victim's slashed face; the prosecutorial misconduct issue was abandoned; the statute under which defendant was charged was not vague; counsel was not ineffective; and there was no cumulative error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the order of the District Court of Valencia County, New Mexico, convicting him for attempted first degree murder, conspiracy to commit first degree murder, aggravated battery inflicting great bodily harm, conspiracy to commit aggravated battery, and criminal solicitation to commit murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for attempted first degree murder, conspiracy to commit first degree murder, aggravated battery inflicting great bodily harm, conspiracy to commit aggravated battery, and criminal solicitation to commit murder. He argued that his state and federal constitutional rights to be protected from double jeopardy were violated. He also asserted that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of two witnesses not timely disclosed by the State. Finding merits in these points, the court reversed in part. Defendant's convictions for both attempted first degree murder and aggravated battery did not violate double jeopardy principles. Although the underlying conduct was unitary, defendant could be punished for both offenses. Under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-28-3(D), a defendant could not be guilty of both criminal solicitation and conspiracy to commit murder. Therefore, the court determined that defendant's conviction for criminal solicitation had to be vacated. Defendant failed to meet his burden of showing prejudice from the late disclosure of two witnesses by the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions for attempted first degree murder, aggravated battery resulting in great bodily harm, and conspiracy to commit murder, because double jeopardy rule was not violated. However, the court reversed the conviction for conspiracy to commit aggravated battery. The trial court was also ordered to vacate the conviction for criminal solicitation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the decision of the District Court of Santa Fe County (New Mexico), which held that plaintiffs had implicitly waived their attorney-client privilege and work product protection, and granted defendants' discovery request.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were a public utility company and a bank acting as trustee of a fund intended for decommissioning of nuclear plants in the future. Plaintiffs discovered that life insurance investments issued by defendants would not yield sufficient funds for plaintiff utility to meet its obligations. Plaintiffs sued under numerous theories including fraud, equitable estoppel, and equitable tolling. Plaintiffs claimed certain documents were protected by the attorney-client privilege and work product. The trial court granted defendants' motion to compel production. The court of appeals reversed and remanded, holding that plaintiffs' claim of equitable tolling, based on prior ignorance of their claims, did not implicitly waive the attorney-client privilege. The court held that such waiver was governed exclusively by N.M. R. Evid. 11-511, which required voluntary disclosure of confidential matters in order to invoke waiver. The court rejected the &quot;Hearn approach&quot; applied by the trial court, and remanded to address any separate work product issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court judgment reversed in part, because the trial court was not free to engage in ad hoc rule-making and waiver analysis. The relevant rule of evidence required voluntary disclosure by a party in order for the other party to argue that the attorney-client privilege had been waived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the parties married, appellee adopted appellant daughter, assuming parental rights and obligations as to her support. Upon divorcing, the parties entered into a marriage settlement agreement (MSA) providing, among other things, that they would split equally the costs of appellant daughter's college education. The MSA was incorporated into the divorce decree. When appellee refused to pay his share of appellant daughter's post-minority expenses, appellants sued. Their action was dismissed and they appealed. The appellate court disagreed. Although the district court was without power to order post-minority support of its own authority, it had the power to enforce valid agreements that included post-minority support. The support provision in the MSA was based explicitly on a contract theory and indicated the parties' clear intent to separate the incurred obligation from the rest of the court's order. Thus, the clause to split post-minority support did not merge into the divorce decree and was enforceable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner child services filed a Neglect Abuse Petition under New Mexico Abuse and Neglect Act, (Act) N.M. Stat.

The proceeding culminated in a determination of &quot;neglect or abuse&quot; within the meaning of the Act, placement of the child in the legal custody of petitioner, and the adoption of a treatment plan. Defendants appealed, contending the evidence was insufficient to support the judgment, and the Act was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court affirmed the decision on all grounds holding that the evidence solidly supported the court's determinations, and that N.M. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his sentence for vehicular homicide, incidents involving death or great bodily injury, tampering with evidence, and unlawful taking of motor vehicle from District Court of Eddy County (New Mexico), which sentenced him to basic sentences authorized by statute, with no aggravating or mitigating circumstances increasing or reducing them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In sentencing defendant on his guilty and no contest pleas, the trial court did not consider any mitigating circumstances. Refusing to mitigate was not error because defendant received the basic sentence under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-18-15 (1993) and the trial judge was not obligated to depart from the basic sentence. N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-7-201(B), (C) (1989) were not vague because N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-7-201(C) (1989) required the additional element of knowing behavior. The essence of defendant's vagueness claim rested on a lack of notice; therefore he could not succeed on his claim because the statute clearly applied to his conduct before and after the accident. Since defendant did not contest the actions and statements upon which the charges were based, he deprived any fact finder from assessing the sufficiency of the evidence to show vagueness between the statutes. Defendant's sentence was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sentence was affirmed because trial court did not err in refusing to mitigate basic sentence and statute describing third degree and fourth degree felony for accident involving death or personal injuries was not vague under the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>
