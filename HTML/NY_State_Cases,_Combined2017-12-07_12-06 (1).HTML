</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for two counts of attempted murder in the second degree, four counts of assault in the first degree, two counts criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree and other related crimes. Defendant raised a justification defense, and the trial court so charged the jury as to all counts. The trial court issued its opinion to explain the ruling as to the weapon possession charge in light of the Pons doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was contacted by his girlfriend, who told defendant that the victim had thrown a drink in her face, and that if defendant did not come soon, she was going to kill the victim. Defendant went to the bar and confronted the victim, who was known to carry a gun. The girlfriend then confronted the victim. Defendant attempted to escort the girlfriend away, and felt a gun tucked into the back of her pants. When the victim appeared to reach for a gun, defendant pulled the gun from the back of the girlfriend's pants and fired, injuring the victim. Under the Pons decision, justification did not apply to weapons possession counts even when intent to use the weapon unlawfully was an element of the crime. The court held that the Pons holding had to be understood as applying only to those cases such as Pons where the defendant possessed the weapon for some &quot;continuum&quot; of time other than when he justifiably used it. In cases where no continuum of possession existed, the court held that Pons was inapplicable and that justification therefore remained a defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court determined that in the case before it, justification was a valid defense to the charge of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Justification -- Criminal Possession of Weapon -- Justification Defense Applicable in Absence of &quot;Continuum&quot; of Possession</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where the defense of justification was applicable with respect to the attempted murder and assault charges against defendant arising from a shooting incident in which defendant pulled a gun from the back of his girlfriend's pants during an altercation with a person he thought possessed a gun, justification was also properly charged as a defense to the two criminal possession of a weapon counts of the indictment. Justification is not a defense to a charge of weapon possession when the accused possessed the weapon for some &quot;continuum&quot; of time prior to the otherwise justified use of the weapon. However, justification remains a defense when, as here, the possession and use occur at the same moment and there is thus no &quot;continuum&quot; of possession.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the conclusion of the People's case and after the People rested, defendant moved for a trial order of dismissal of all the charges, arguing that there was insufficient evidence on the record to make a prima facie case as to any of the charges and, in particular, that the People had failed to prove that defendant was operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol as required by N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1192(1) and (3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that there was not legally sufficient evidence to conclude that defendant was driving while under the influence of alcohol because while the People established that his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired, the evidence did not establish that such impairment was caused by the consumption of alcohol. Therefore, defendant could only be found guilty if N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1192(3) proscribed operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of drugs. Based on the legislative pronouncements in connection with the enactment and subsequent amendments of the New York Vehicle and Traffic Law, the trial court concluded that &sect; 1192(3) did not cover intoxication caused by a substance other than alcohol. The trial court's conclusion was buttressed by the case law, which similarly concluded that &sect; 1192(3) referred exclusively to alcohol intoxication, and by the language of the pattern jury instruction for &sect; 1192(3), which clearly limited &quot;intoxication&quot; to the state caused by alcohol consumption. Thus, the People failed to prove that defendant was under the influence of alcohol, an element of both counts in their accusatory instrument.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An accusatory instrument charging defendant with driving while intoxicated under Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 (3) was dismissed at the conclusion of the People's case due to the lack of legally sufficient evidence proving that defendant's impairment was caused by the consumption of alcohol. The arresting officer, who observed defendant unconscious in the driver's seat of a vehicle that had crashed into a parked car, initially arrested defendant for driving under the influence of drugs. However, defendant refused to submit to a chemical test, and no test was performed to confirm the presence of drugs. Under these circumstances, defendant could not be convicted of driving while intoxicated under section 1192 (3) since that statute applies exclusively to alcohol intoxication. Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 (3) does not apply to impairment caused solely by drugs or other unidentified substances.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, the City of Buffalo (New York) and others, sought a declaration that the Nation-State Gaming Compact entered into by defendant governor and the Seneca Nation of Indians, was unconstitutional in part and void under N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 to the extent that it authorized a casino anywhere in Erie County outside of the City of Buffalo. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The governor and the Seneca Nation entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) establishing certain terms for a Tribal-State Compact to authorize the development of Class III gaming casinos, and the legislature enacted N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 12 to authorize the governor to execute a Compact pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), 25 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2701-2721; 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1166-1168. Granting plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and denying defendants' motions, the court held, inter alia, that (1) plaintiffs had standing under N.Y. State Fin. Law &sect; 123-b to challenge the allegedly unconstitutional or illegal expenditures of state funds contemplated to be expended; (2) the court's resolution of the issues did not require the presence of the Seneca Nation; (3) the issues raised concerned state constitutional law not preempted by the IGRA; (4) the Compact was not consistent with the MOU, and the portion of the Compact which authorized a casino outside the City was unconstitutional under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; III because the location of casinos was a matter of public policy for the legislature to decide; and (5) the invalid portion of the Compact was severable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and declared that the portion of the contract that permitted the Seneca Nation to locate a Class III gaming facility in any location in Erie County outside of the City of Buffalo violated separation of powers principles. The court severed the invalid provision, granted plaintiffs' application for a permanent injunction, and denied defendants' cross-motions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing -- Challenge to Legality of Gaming Compact with Indian Tribe</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs had standing as citizen-taxpayers under State Finance Law &sect; 123-b to challenge the legality of a gaming compact with an Indian tribe that authorized the development of class III gaming casinos on Indian lands in Erie County. The statute provided standing to plaintiffs to bring an action to challenge the allegedly unconstitutional or illegal expenditure of state funds contemplated under the memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Governor and the tribe; the statute authorizing the Governor to enter into a compact consistent with the MOU (Executive Law &sect; 12); and the compact itself, without regard to whether there was an alternative, legal expenditure of the same funds.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Ripeness Doctrine </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Declaratory relief was available in a citizen-taxpayers' action under State Finance Law &sect; 123-b challenging the legality of planned state expenditures in connection with a gaming compact with an Indian tribe that authorized the development of class III gaming casinos on Indian lands in Erie County. A number of steps had already been taken toward the establishment of the casino. The United States Department of Interior tacitly approved the Compact. The tribe planned to use funds received from the State in settling certain land claims to purchase property in order to construct the casino. Under these circumstances, the action was not premature.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Necessary Parties -- Challenge to Legality of Gaming Compact with Indian Tribe </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Indian tribe that entered into a compact with the State authorizing it to develop class III gaming casinos in Erie County was not an indispensable party to the citizen-taxpayers' action under State Finance Law &sect; 123-b challenging the legality of planned state expenditures in connection with the Tribal-State Compact. The presence of the tribe was not required to resolve any issue of contractual intent or any factual dispute. The resolution of the case rested solely upon the court's interpretation of the unambiguous provisions of the memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Governor and the tribe, the statute authorizing the Governor to enter into a compact consistent with the MOU (Executive Law &sect; 12), and the Compact itself, together with relevant constitutional provisions relating to the separation of powers (NY Const, art III, &sect; 1; art IV, &sect; 1).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Federal Preemption -- Challenge to Legality of Gaming Compact with Indian Tribe Not Preempted by Indian Gaming Regulatory Act</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A citizen-taxpayers' action under State Finance Law &sect; 123-b challenging the legality of a gaming compact that authorized the development of class III gaming casinos on Indian lands in Erie County was not preempted by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (IGRA) (25 USC &sect; 2701 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">). While the federal statute preempts the area of regulation of gaming on Indian lands, the statute does not negate the applicability of state constitutional and statutory law to issues involving the execution of a Tribal-State Compact. The question of whether the legislation that authorized the Governor to enter into a compact &quot;consistent with&quot; a memorandum of understanding regarding the development of a casino in the City of Buffalo (Executive Law &sect; 12) lawfully delegated to the Governor any power concerning the location of a casino outside the City of Buffalo raised issues of state constitutional law not preempted by IGRA or any other federal law.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Separation of Powers -- Governor's Execution of Gaming Compact with Indian Tribe without Legislative Approval </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Governor lacked authority under the separation of powers doctrine to enter into a gaming compact with an Indian tribe that authorized the development of a class III gaming casino on Indian lands outside the City of Buffalo. Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (25 USC &sect; 2701 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), and as a matter of state constitutional law (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art III, &sect; 1; art IV, &sect; 1), the location of a class III gaming casino must be authorized by the Legislature. Here, the initial memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Governor and the tribe referred to the establishment of a casino in Erie County within the City of Buffalo. The MOU further provided that, in the event a site in the City of Buffalo was not available for any reason, the tribe &quot;would propose an alternate site.&quot; The enabling legislation authorized the Governor to enter into a gaming compact &quot;consistent with&quot; the terms of the MOU (Executive Law &sect; 12). The Compact was not &quot;consistent with&quot; the MOU to the extent that it authorized the tribe to select a location for a casino in Erie County outside the City of Buffalo. Any change in the municipal location of the casino outside the City of Buffalo required additional legislative authorization. Moreover, the certification by the Governor that the Compact was &quot;consistent with&quot; the MOU did not remedy the constitutional infirmity. However, the invalid provision of the Compact was severed, leaving the remainder of the Compact in full force and effect.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the licensing requirement was unconstitutional as applied as it had the effect of preventing same-sex marriages. The People argued that the law was violated and that it was obligated to prosecute defendant. The trial court held that court decisions and legislative enactments addressing related issues had left no doubt that New York policy favored ameliorating the discriminatory effect of the laws on homosexuals. The trial court applied the rational basis standard to defendant's equal protection challenge. As the People did not show that there was a legitimate state interest in refusing marriage to same-sex partners, and as the New York Attorney General did not exercise its right to intervene to defend the state's interest in a statute that had the effect of preventing same-sex couples from marrying, the trial court found that the defense rebutted the presumption of constitutionality of N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 13. Thus, the burden of proof on that issue shifted to the People. The equal protection guarantees enshrined in the state and federal constitutions were paramount to the reasons given in cases from other states for opposing same-sex marriages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with second degree aggravated harassment, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.30(1), and second degree harassment, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.26(1), for writing two letters to a person unknown to him while he was incarcerated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The first letter apologized for the invasion of privacy and, essentially, requested permission to call. The second letter, referencing the lack of a response, spoke of having to call if the recipient did not write the inmate back. While receiving mail from an inmate unknown to the recipient may have been unsettling, the letters did not seriously express an intent to do an act of unlawful violence and could not reasonably be so interpreted. A statement that defendant would continue to write was not a &quot;true threat&quot; or its equivalent. A reference to &quot;Plan B,&quot; if the letter was not responded to, was ambiguous and explained by the letter's final sentence which said defendant, absent a response, would call the recipient. Had defendant continued to write or made unwelcome telephone calls, he might have committed unlawful harassment, but the two letters he sent were not within any proscribable class of speech or conduct and were protected, requiring dismissal of the aggravated harassment charges. As no facts were stated to base harassment on, because no physical contact was allegedly attempted or threatened, the harassment charge had to be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accusatory instrument charging defendant, a prison inmate, with aggravated harassment in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 240.30 [1]) based upon his having written two letters to a person selected at random from a telephone directory in the hope that he might get a visit, telephone call or a written reply, was dismissed for facial insufficiency. The statute provides that a person is guilty of aggravated harassment in the second degree &quot;when, with intent to harass, annoy, threaten or alarm another person, he . . . communicates with a person . . . by mail . . . in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm.&quot; The complaint, as a matter of law, failed to allege facts which constituted harassing conduct or true threats. While letters written by defendant one month apart may have been unsettling to complainant, they did not fall within the proscribable classes of speech or conduct.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When defendant, who was convicted of robbery, learned that he was subject to sentencing as a persistent violent felony offender under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 78.08, he orally moved the court not to impose an enhanced sentence, arguing that the statute violated the Apprendi rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">New York's highest court had already held that discretionary sentence enhancement based on prior convictions did not violate the Apprendi rule that any sentencing factor other than a prior conviction which enhanced a defendant's sentence had to first be included in an indictment and found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The instant court held that the rationale applied as well to the persistent felony offender statute. Defendant's prior convictions of violent crimes were notorious and open enough that they could be judicially noticed, and the mere fact that the court had to make a purely ministerial determination that a period of incarceration had tolled a 10-year limitations period applicable to the calculation of prior violent felony convictions in a 10-year period did not mean that there had been a violation of the right to trial by jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the motion and sentenced defendant as a persistent violent felony offender.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Persistent Violent Felony Offender -- Constitutionality of Mandatory Sentencing Procedure</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mandatory sentencing procedure under which defendant received an enhanced sentence as a persistent violent felony offender (Penal Law &sect; 70.08; CPL 400.16), based upon his two prior violent felony convictions occurring within the previous 10 years (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 70.04 [1] [b]), is not unconstitutional. A criminal defendant has no constitutional right to a jury trial to establish the fact of a prior conviction for purposes of enhanced sentencing. A prior conviction is a sentencing factor, not an element of the crime, and thus need not be pleaded in the indictment in order for it to serve as the basis for enhanced sentencing. Furthermore, the sentencing court's ministerial act of calculating the amount of time defendant was incarcerated for purposes of determining the number of predicate violent felony convictions he sustained over the requisite 10-year period did not require a jury's finding beyond a reasonable doubt. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner bar owner brought an N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding against respondent county health board, contending the board acted improperly in fining him for violations of N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 1399-o(2), which was part of New York's Clean Indoor Air Act and which provided that smoking was not permitted in bars.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner operated a saloon and was twice found in violation of N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 1399-o(2) by allowing people to smoke at the bar. He was fined both times and was unsuccessful on his appeals of both fines. The owner commenced an action claiming the board exceeded its authority by imposing liability on him where his patrons were smoking and he was powerless to stop them. He also argued that the board was selectively enforcing the statute by targeting the bar owners rather than the smokers, that he was denied due process, and that the board's determination was not supported by substantial evidence. The court found that the evidence showed it was not a case where the bar's patrons were smoking in violation of the owner's good faith efforts to get them to stop, and the evidence showed the bartender blatantly allowed customers to smoke in the bar. Moreover, the owner received sufficient notice and opportunity to present his arguments, and since smokers were not a protected class for equal protection purposes, the owner could not justify his selective enforcement argument. Finally, the court rejected a challenge to the statute's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, petitioner was not denied due process. Petitioner was notified of the allegations of smoking and was given an opportunity to rebut them. In addition, respondent's determination was supported by substantial evidence. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a supreme court judge, moved to dismiss two indictments charging him with one count of bribe receiving in the third degree, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 200.10; six counts of receiving reward for official misconduct in the second degree, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 200.25; three counts of official misconduct, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 195.00; and one count of receiving unlawful gratuities, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 200.35.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">All of the charges related to defendant's conduct as a judge presiding over matrimonial cases in the supreme court. Granting defendant's motion to dismiss in part, the court held that the evidence was legally sufficient to support the count for bribe receiving; one, but only one, count of official misconduct; and the count for receiving unlawful gratuities. However, the grand jury evidence demonstrating that defendant violated the Rules of the Chief Administrator, N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 22, &sect; 100.3(B)(6) and &sect; 100.2(C), was legally insufficient to establish that defendant violated a duty he had as a public servant within the meaning of the Penal Law. In addition, the court held that the grand jury proceeding which resulted in the second indictment was not defective because the prosecutor was not required to submit all at once every piece of available evidence and every charge, and it held that the eavesdropping and video surveillance evidence was admissible because the applications made out probable cause sufficient to support the issuance of the warrants and established that normal investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed in obtaining the evidence sought.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted defendant's motion to the extent of dismissing the six counts of receiving reward for official misconduct in the second degree and two counts of official misconduct, and it denied defendant's motion in all other respects. The court also order that all discovery disputes be referred to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Receiving Reward for Official Misconduct -- Prosecution of Judge Improperly Based upon Violation of Rules Governing Judicial Conduct</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant, a Justice of the Supreme Court, could not be criminally prosecuted for the class E felony of receiving reward for official misconduct in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 200.25) based upon violations of the Rules Governing Judicial Conduct (22 NYCRR part 100). In any prosecution for receiving reward for official misconduct, the evidence must identify a duty the defendant had as a public servant, and must establish that the defendant violated that duty and thereafter solicited, accepted or agreed to accept a benefit for having done so. Defendant herein allegedly engaged in ex parte conversations with an attorney representing a party in a case then pending before him, and later accepted a box of expensive cigars for having done so, in violation of the rule that prohibits a judge from engaging in unauthorized ex parte communications (22 NYCRR 100.3 [b] [6]). Defendant also allegedly accepted &quot;referral fees&quot; from a lawyer in violation of the rule that prohibits a judge from lending &quot;the prestige of judicial office to advance the private interests of the judge or others&quot; (22 NYCRR 100.2 [c]). However, the Rules Governing Judicial Conduct were not designed or intended as a basis for criminal prosecution. Consequently, the evidence presented to the grand jury that defendant violated two ethical rules was insufficient to establish that he violated a duty he had as a public servant within the meaning of the Penal Law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Official Misconduct -- Judge's Acceptance of Compensation for Giving Advice in Pending Matter</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant, a Justice of the Supreme Court, was lawfully charged with official misconduct (Penal Law &sect; 195.00) for having allegedly engaged in unauthorized ex parte conversations with an attorney representing a party in a case then pending before him, and later accepting a box of expensive cigars for having done so. The official misconduct charge was not based upon defendant's mere violation of a rule of judicial conduct (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">22 NYCRR 100.3 [b] [6]), but, rather, was based upon defendant's violation of Judiciary Law &sect; 18. That statute prohibits a judge from demanding or receiving compensation for giving advice in a matter pending before that judge. The evidence presented to the grand jury was legally sufficient to establish that defendant, acting with the intent to obtain a benefit and knowing that he was not authorized to do so, received compensation in the form of a box of expensive cigars for giving advice to an attorney who was representing a party in a case then pending before him, and thereby committed an act relating to his office but constituting an unauthorized exercise of his official functions. However, defendant could not be charged with separate official misconduct counts for having given advice and then having received compensation for that advice. The evidence was legally sufficient to support only one count of official misconduct. In addition, the evidence was also legally sufficient to support the charges of receiving unlawful gratuities (Penal Law &sect; 200.35). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grand Jury -- Defective Proceeding -- Submission of Additional Charges to Grand Jury after Obtaining Indictment</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A grand jury proceeding that resulted in a second indictment against defendant, a Justice of the Supreme Court, adding a new charge of bribe receiving in the third degree to the first indictment and additional charges of official misconduct, was not defective because of the prosecutor's failure to secure court authorization before submitting the additional charges. A prosecutor's withdrawal of a case from the grand jury after presentation of the evidence is the equivalent of a dismissal, and therefore triggers the requirement that judicial authorization be obtained before the matter is resubmitted (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 190.75 [3]). Here, after obtaining the first indictment, the People presented further evidence to the same grand jury and asked it to consider indicting defendant for additional crimes. The People did not present charges to a second grand jury after they had been rejected by a first, and did not engage in forum shopping by withdrawing a case from one grand jury in the hope of later presenting the same evidence to a more compliant second one. The People are not required, when presenting a case to a grand jury, to submit for consideration all at once every piece of available evidence and every charge arguably arising out of the criminal transaction under investigation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Eavesdropping Warrants -- Probable Cause</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Eavesdropping and video surveillance evidence was lawfully obtained for use against defendant, a Justice of the Supreme Court, in his prosecution for bribe receiving and other related charges. The warrant applications sufficiently established probable cause to believe that defendant committed or was about to commit certain designated offenses and that communications or observations concerning those offenses would be obtained through the proposed electronic surveillance (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 700.15). In addition, the warrant applications sufficiently established that normal investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed in obtaining the evidence sought. Furthermore, the electronic surveillance did not continue for a longer period than was necessary to achieve the objectives stated in the warrants.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The foster child was 14 years old. The adoptive parents adopted his biological siblings, eight-year-old twins. The foster child had been a foster child in the home of the parents prior to the placement of his sisters there, but was removed due to sexually inappropriate behavior and temper tantrums. The adoptive parents strongly opposed contact between the foster child and the twins. The foster child filed a petition seeking visitation with his biological siblings. The adoptive parents filed a motion to dismiss. The court granted the motion to dismiss, finding that even if the child's standing to apply for visitation had not been extinguished by the twins' adoption, he still had to establish that in the circumstances of the case equity would see fit to intervene. The court then found that the child had not met his first-step burden of showing a basis to overrule the adoptive parents' presumptively proper parental decision prohibiting visitation because he failed to show the existence of an ongoing and affectionate relationship with his siblings. Therefore, the court held that it would not proceed to the second step of conducting a best interest hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that the factual allegations in the information supporting the count of stalking in the fourth degree were sufficient to meet the reasonable cause and prima facie requirements of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 100.40. A fair reading of the information provided defendant with notice that he needed to defend against a charge that defendant had engaged in a course of conduct directed at the complainant, against her express wishes, and that the course of conduct was likely to cause reasonable fear of material harm. The fact that defendant was not charged with making any verbal threats did not make the information insufficient given the sheer number of unwelcome communications made to the complainant. The court found that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 120.45 did not violate defendant's free speech rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution or under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 because the criminal liability did not arise from the content of the speech but from defendant's alleged course of conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who was indicted on various homicide counts, had been previously directed by the court to file a late notice of intent that he was claiming a defense of &quot;extreme emotional disturbance&quot; (EED) under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.25. The court then granted the People's request to have defendant examined by their psychological expert. Before the court was the admissibility and permissible scope of the People's expert's testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant strangled his former girlfriend, and, after the People made a Molineux application, defense counsel stated that defendant was claiming that the murder was done under circumstances evincing EED and that the defense would present only non-expert testimony on the issue. Establishing the parameters of the People's expert's testimony in light of defendant's Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, the court held, inter alia, that (1) the examination of the expert could be conducted in front of the jury because, even if the court had not ordered the examination, the People could have had a mental health expert sit in the courtroom, cross-examined defendant, and then called the expert to testify; (2) the court-ordered examination was constitutional and did not violate the Fifth Amendment because the expert's testimony would only be admitted after defendant had in fact waived his Fifth Amendment right by testifying to a mental state or to facts from which the jury could infer a mental state defense; and (3) at this stage, the court did not need to decide whether the People could use a statement made to the People's expert for impeachment purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court limited the prosecution's use of defendant's statements given to the mental health expert to the issue of &quot;extreme emotional disturbance&quot; and no other use.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Insanity -- Extreme Emotional Disturbance -- Defendant as Sole Witness</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defendant in a homicide prosecution who intended to offer only his own testimony that he was acting under the influence of an extreme emotional disturbance at the time he killed his girlfriend was required to submit to a psychiatric examination by a prosecution expert. The court was authorized to order such an examination by its inherent power to achieve justice. Although the government's need for evidence cannot override a defendant's right against self-incrimination, if the defendant testifies as to his mental state at the time of the crime, he waives his Fifth Amendment rights on that issue. Accordingly, a court-ordered examination of defendant was constitutional and did not violate defendant's right against self-incrimination. The expert's testimony will only be admitted after the defendant has in fact waived his Fifth Amendment right by testifying to a mental state or to facts from which the jury can infer a mental state defense. If defendant places his mental state in issue, whether by offering an insanity defense or otherwise, the People's expert is limited to testifying to the mental state issue and no other.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, charged with numerous offenses in a violent outburst at the home of the victim and her children, moved to dismiss on grounds that the statute defining the offense was vague and overbroad.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 353-a, also called Buster's Law in honor of a cat that had been horribly tortured in a celebrated incident, made intentional acts of cruelty toward a companion animal a felony. Defendant had been charged with that offense, among others, after smashing a fish bowl that contained three goldfish belonging to the victim and her children. While the victim attempted to rescue the fish, defendant called the eldest child into the room and crushed the goldfish named for that child under his heel. The court held that a goldfish was clearly an animal within the meaning of N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 350 and was also a companion animal within the meaning of that statute since the children cared for and named the goldfish, after themselves. Any person of ordinary understanding would have understood that the goldfish were pets protected against defendant's cruel behavior by the criminal statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. A goldfish may qualify as a &quot;domesticated animal&quot; entitled to protection under Agriculture and Markets Law &sect; 353-a, making aggravated cruelty to animals a felony. A protected animal must be cared for and maintained by human beings in or near a human household. There is no requirement that the domesticated animal be a mammal. It is not uncommon to see a goldfish as a child's pet, dutifully maintained and cared for by its young human owner. The statutory definition of &quot;companion animal&quot; uses ordinary terms to express ideas which find adequate interpretation in common usage. Both a potential offender of ordinary intelligence and a police officer would be adequately informed of the nature of the offense prohibited by the statute.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Aggravated Cruelty to Animals -- Goldfish as Household Pets</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a prosecution for aggravated cruelty to animals pursuant to Agriculture and Markets Law &sect; 353-a, the goldfish that defendant crushed under his heel after destroying its aquarium was a household pet entitled to protection under the statute. All three of the goldfish in the aquarium had names given to them by the children in the household and were cared for in the manner of pets. It is beyond cavil that a person of ordinary intelligence, including a police officer charged with enforcing the law, would know that the common household pet known as a goldfish is a companion animal intended to be protected under the statute, and that, in particular, the crushed goldfish was such a companion animal. There is no requirement that a protected animal must necessarily experience pain in order to come within the purview of the statute.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Aggravated Cruelty to Animals -- Goldfish as Household Pets -- Constitutionality of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Agriculture and Markets Law &sect; 353-a, making it a felony to engage in aggravated cruelty to animals, is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant, who destroyed an aquarium and crushed a pet goldfish under his heel, after summoning the pet's child owner into the room. Therefore defendant's as-applied and facial challenge to the statute must fail. People of ordinary intelligence understand that goldfish are pets, beloved by their owners, and are not to be killed or eaten. While humans can and do kill and eat fish on a regular basis, they do not do so if the fish at issue is a pet belonging to a young child. The statutory definition of &quot;companion animal&quot; does not require that the animal be trained or provide company and interaction with a human. Rather, the animal need only be cared for and maintained in or near the household of its human owner. Moreover, eating food fish is for a &quot;justified purpose,&quot; which the statute permits. The sadistic actions defendant took against the goldfish in this case speak to defendant's understanding that he was killing a companion animal. </SPAN></P>

The detective spent several hours talking with the informant and with his supervisors. Later that day, without obtaining a warrant, police entered defendant's apartment and conducted a search. An emergency team, an arson and explosion team, and a bomb squad with trained dogs searched the apartment and found no explosives of any kind. The detective then entered the apartment and found a handgun. Defendant and his family were taken to the precinct, where defendant signed statements admitting responsibility for the gun. The court, in granting the motion to suppress, concluded that there was no emergency such as would justify the warrantless entry. During the hours spent discussing the information, the police could have been preparing an affidavit and going to court for a search warrant. Moreover, by that time the detective entered, it was clear that no emergency existed. Defendant's statements were inextricably connected to the illegal search and, because his family was detained, were not shown to be voluntary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, charged with animal cruelty under N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 353, sought dismissal of the information on the ground that the statute was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant owned a dog that was suffering from terminal cancer and had a large and apparently painful tumor. Defendant stated that he chose not to provide veterinary treatment for the dog because of his limited finances and because he believed that a natural death would be less painful for the dog than undergoing invasive surgery. The court determined that the plain meaning of the term &quot;sustenance&quot; in N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 353 did not include veterinary care. Therefore, the provision making it a violation of the statute to fail to provide necessary sustenance did not afford notice to a person of ordinary intelligence that not providing veterinary care was a violation of the statute. Moreover, as used in N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 350, the term &quot;unjustifiable physical pain&quot; was too vague to warn pet owners that not providing veterinary care for their pets was a crime. The court concluded that a pet owner could not be prosecuted under N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 353 for failing to provide a terminally ill pet with veterinary care.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a prosecution alleging that defendant failed to provide &quot;necessary sustenance&quot; to his dog within the meaning of Agriculture and Markets Law &sect; 353 by failing to provide the terminally ill animal with medical care, the term &quot;sustenance&quot; as used in the statute does not include the provision of medical care. Statutory language is generally construed according to its natural and most obvious sense, without resorting to an artificial or forced construction. The dictionary defines sustenance as &quot;means of sustaining life; food, victuals&quot;; &quot;a kind of quantity of food&quot;; &quot;nourishment&quot;; and &quot;the action of sustaining life by food.&quot; This comports with the popular meaning of the term as used in the vernacular, that is, that sustenance refers to food and nourishment, not medical care. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Animals -- Cruelty to Animals -- Provision of Medical Care to Ill Animals</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Agriculture and Markets Law &sect; 353 was unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant, who failed to provide medical care to his terminally ill dog. The term &quot;unjustifiable physical pain&quot; is too vague to warn pet owners that not providing medical care for their pets is a crime. What is &quot;unjustifiable&quot; in the context of anticruelty statutes is what is not reasonable, defensible, right, unavoidable or excusable. Merely adding the term &quot;unjustifiable&quot; to the word &quot;pain&quot; does not transform conduct that is inherently innocent, like allowing an animal to die of natural causes without providing medical care, into a crime. Purely statutory offenses cannot be established by implication, and acts otherwise innocent and lawful do not become crimes, unless there is a clear and positive expression of the legislative intent to make them criminal. Neither society's current practice nor the moral standards of the community expand the meaning of the term &quot;unjustifiable&quot; to include a duty on owners to provide their animals with medical care. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with selling, on the street, playing cards without a general vendor's license in violation of New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 20-453, and he moved to dismiss the complaint alleging that the facts alleged were insufficient to make out the crime charged and that U.S. Const. amend. I and N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the playing cards were &quot;art&quot; entitled to constitutional protection because they bore the photographic images of military and political figures associated with the Iraqi war. Denying defendant's motion, the court held that (1) the factual allegations of the complaint, if true, were sufficient to establish that defendant was committing the crime of acting as an unlicensed general vendor; and (2) the playing cards allegedly offered for sale by defendant were not a form of written expression, such that defendant would not require a license by reason of the exemption contained within &sect; 20-453, and they were not a form of non-verbal, artistic or visual expression, such that the license requirement of &sect; 20-453 could not be constitutionally enforced against defendant, because there was nothing artistically noteworthy about the photographic images on the cards, nor did they constitute the seller's own artistic endeavor, and there was nothing about the cards which, reasonably interpreted, communicated ideas, opinions, emotions, or a point of view.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a prosecution for selling, on the street, playing cards without a general vendor's license in violation of a local law, the factual allegations of the complaint and the supporting deposition established, if true, every element of the crime charged. The defendant was engaged in offering for sale more than 10 decks of playing cards displayed on a table behind which defendant stood for five minutes. During that time he was seen exchanging the merchandise with one customer in return for currency. Further, defendant did not display the required license nor could he produce one when asked. </SPAN></P>

Defendant, who was selling playing cards bearing the photographic images of military and political figures associated with the war in Iraq, was not engaged in a form of protected expression that would make the application of the vendor's license requirement contained in a local ordinance unconstitutional as applied to him. The cards, in and of themselves, were not art, nor did they depict works of art. Moreover, the visual images on the cards did not constitute a form of nonverbal expression which, like books, pamphlets or other writings, effectively communicated ideas, concepts or emotions. There was nothing about the cards which, reasonably interpreted, communicated ideas, opinions, emotions or a point of view.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The village began a walkway project that required the relocation of the company's utility poles. The village told the company of its responsibility for the costs and the company eventually paid the costs, with a reservation of rights and under protest. The village's board of trustees then passed a local law that established assessments for the removal of obstructions. The company was assessed its special franchise assessment and after it failed to appear at a hearing, the amount to move the poles was assessed against it. The court first held that the village's local law was not inconsistent with New York law because it imposed a special assessment and not a tax. The assessment was not discriminatory because the local law was in conformity with the provisions of general law and did not arbitrarily or unreasonably &quot;single out&quot; a specific entity or group, especially where it was a general principle that utility companies were to bear the cost of relocation in matters of health, safety, and welfare.

In a proceeding challenging the validity of a tax invoice whereby a village sought payment for the cost of relocating utility poles as part of a pedestrian walkway renovation project, the local law pursuant to which the invoice was issued carries a presumption of constitutionality and petitioner utility bears the burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that it is unconstitutional. Although petitioner maintained that the law contravened Village Law &sect; 5-530, which authorizes taxes on public utilities based only upon gross income or gross operating income, the local law in issue did not impose a tax, but rather a special assessment.

In a proceeding challenging the validity of a tax invoice whereby a village sought payment for the cost of relocating utility poles as part of a pedestrian walkway renovation project, the village's imposition of the special assessment did not unfairly discriminate against petitioner by shifting to it costs that should be borne by the taxpayer. Highway Law &sect; 319, which imposes upon the owner of a permanent highway obstruction the cost of its removal, is applicable to villages as well as to towns, and as a general principle of law utility companies must bear the cost of relocation in matters relating to health, safety and welfare. The privilege granted to a utility to maintain its facilities in public streets gives the utility no property interest in the right-of-way, only a license to maintain its facilities there.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner landowners brought a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding challenging a decision made by respondent Commissioner of the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, holding that the landowners were not entitled to a 7/8 interest in production revenue from oil and gas leases, but that they were entitled to receive a 1/8 royalty payment. The landowners also sought a declaratory judgment directing the entitlement to future royalties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners argued that the Commissioner's decision was contrary to N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 23-0901(3). The reviewing court held that the Commissioner did not violate any of the public hearing provisions or the procedures for compulsory integration. The determination that the landowners were only entitled to a 1/8 working interest was not arbitrary and capricious or unreasonable. The Commissioner's application of &sect; 23-0901(3) was supported by statutory construction, resulted in a reasonable allocation of production revenues, and was consistent with the Commissioner's prior rulings. The owners were not owners under N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 23-0101(11), as they did not have or qualify for a drilling permit, and they were not operators. The Commissioner's interpretation of N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 23-0901(3) was consistent with the rule of capture. Deference was given to the Commissioner's ruling as the Department was entrusted with the administration of N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law art. 23, which required specialized knowledge and expertise. Finally, a declaratory judgment action was not the proper method of challenging an administrative determination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The determination of the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation that petitioners, in their capacity as landowner and/or lessee in connection with certain oil and gas leases, were not entitled to a seven-eighths interest in the production revenue allocated to the parcel in which they had an interest, was not arbitrary and capricious, irrational or unreasonable. Petitioners' interest in the subject drilling unit comprised .30% of the unit's total acreage. Neither petitioner participated in or contributed to the costs of exploration or drilling, qualified for or was granted a drilling permit, or entered into voluntary integration in connection with the drilling unit (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;ECL 23-0701). Petitioners did not qualify as an owner within the meaning of ECL 23-0901 (3), which would have entitled them to a seven-eighths working interest in the production revenue, since neither was granted a drilling permit or controlled enough acreage to qualify for one. Further, the Commissioner's interpretation of the provisions of 23-0901 (3) was consistent with the common law of New York which adheres to the rule of capture, i.e., title to subsurface oil and gas vests in the party which first brings it to the surface and reduces it to possession. Moreover, the Commissioner's interpretation and application of the provisions of ECL 23-0901 (3) was consistent with prior rulings of the Commissioner.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him for facial insufficiency. Defendant was charged with criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 265.01(1), loitering for the purpose of gambling, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.35(2), and disorderly conduct, in violation of &sect; 240.20(5). Defendant's motion also sought other relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The charges arose from defendant having been seen at the same place where dice were observed. Defendant asserted that he was merely watching. The complaint did not allege facts that anything of value was risked or any wagering occurred. Defendant's motion also sought the suppression of statement evidence or, alternatively, a Dunaway/Huntley hearing; preclusion of any unnoticed statement or identification evidence; preclusion of the use at trial of defendant's prior criminal history or misconduct; and discovery. The court granted defendant's motion to dismiss as to the charge of loitering for the purpose of gambling, because there was nothing in the complaint from which it was reasonably inferable that defendant was engaged in loitering for the purpose of gambling based on his mere presence at the place where dice were being rolled. The court found defendant's intent to cause a disturbance was inferred from his obstruction of pedestrian traffic. Further, the gravity knife recovered from defendant's pant's pocket opened and locked when flipped, which established an evidentiary basis to conclude that the knife recovered from defendant was a gravity knife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted defendant's motion to dismiss regarding the loitering charge and denied it as to the disorderly conduct and possession charges.

Preclusion or use of defendant's prior criminal history was referred to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner property owner initiated a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 challenge to the decision of respondent city officials to construct a permanent pedestrian barricade near its building, and sought a preliminary injunction. The owner argued that no environmental quality review had occurred, that the officials had exceeded their powers, and that it had been deprived of the value of its property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The officials decided to erect a barricade in the interests of pedestrian safety in order to prevent foot traffic across a ramp leading into a heavily traveled tunnel. The owner claimed that this reduction in pedestrian access caused it to lose several valuable tenants. The court held, first, that environmental quality review was not needed in the case of a Type II action involving control of traffic control devices, including barricades. Moreover, N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1640(3) empowered the officials to prohibit, restrict, or regulate pedestrian use of highways in the city. Since the owner had not shown a property interest in the barricaded area, there was no taking in violation of due process rights or eminent domain laws. The record showed that the officials had made an extensive study of pedestrian traffic safety matters and considered various alternatives, so there was no basis to allege arbitrary and capricious action. Finally, since the owner's only alleged losses were financial, preliminary injunctive relief was not appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Respondents were not required to prepare an environmental impact study prior to constructing a permanent pedestrian barricade on a public street adjacent to petitioner's mixed use building in order to prevent pedestrians from crossing a dangerous vehicular traffic entrance to a tunnel. The pedestrian barricade is a &quot;traffic control device&quot; erected by respondents &quot;for the purpose of regulating, warning or guiding traffic&quot; (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 153), and is thus exempt from environmental review (6 NYCRR 617.5 [c] [16]).  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Respondents did not exceed their statutory authority in constructing a permanent pedestrian barricade on a public street adjacent to petitioner's mixed use building in order to prevent pedestrians from crossing a dangerous vehicular traffic entrance to a tunnel. Respondents' determination to install the pedestrian barricade as a &quot;traffic control device&quot; (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 153) was properly made pursuant to their authority to &quot;prohibit, restrict, or regulate traffic on or pedestrian use of any highway&quot; in New York City and to otherwise &quot;regulate the crossing of any roadway by pedestrians&quot; (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1642 [a]; &sect; 1640 [a] [3]). Furthermore, respondents' determination had a rational basis and was not arbitrary or capricious. Respondents weighed alternatives such as the placement and use of signs or a traffic light before determining that the pedestrian barricade was the most effective means of alleviating the dangers posed to pedestrians from vehicles turning onto the entrance ramp. </SPAN></P>

Petitioner was not entitled to a jury trial in a CPLR article 78 proceeding challenging respondents' determination to construct a permanent pedestrian barricade on a public street adjacent to petitioner's mixed use building for safety purposes. The issues raised by petitioner as to whether respondents were required to conduct an environmental impact study and whether respondents acted in excess of their jurisdiction presented questions of law to be determined by the court.  </SPAN></P>

Respondents did not violate due process by failing to provide notice, public hearings or publication of any relevant determination or fact-findings prior to constructing a permanent pedestrian barricade on a public street adjacent to petitioner's mixed use building for safety purposes. Petitioner was not deprived of a property interest which warranted due process protection. Furthermore, petitioner failed to demonstrate a &quot;de facto&quot; taking without just compensation which deprived it of all economically viable use of its property (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;EDPL 104). Petitioner's possible loss of rental income from commercial ground floor retail tenants because of the construction of the pedestrian barricade did not constitute a compensable taking.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a trade association of tobacco and candy distributors and several tobacco distributors, sued defendants, the City of New York and various city and state officials, seeking an order enjoining city officials from enforcing New York City, N.Y., Local Laws No. 10 (2002), which raised the excise tax on cigarettes sold in the city. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action. Plaintiffs filed motions as well.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A trade group and several tobacco distributors sued the City of New York and city and state officials, claiming that New York City, N.Y., Local Laws No. 10 (2002), which raised the excise tax on a pack of 20 cigarettes sold in the City from eight cents to $ 1.50, violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.Y. Const. art. 1, &sect; 6, and they sought an order prohibiting city officials from collecting the tax. The trial court held that (1) even assuming that the tax was oppressive, it did not violate the Due Process Clauses of the United States or New York Constitutions, and the trade group and distributors' remedy was to seek relief from the legislature, not from the courts; (2) the court would not allow the trade group and the distributors to depose the Mayor of New York City to see if he had an ulterior motive for urging the City to raise the excise tax; and (3) because the trade group and the distributors were unable to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims, the court would not grant their motion for a preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Tax on Cigarettes and Tobacco Products -- New York City Excise Tax </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A local law of the City of New York, that raised the excise tax on a pack of cigarettes from 8 &cent; to $ 1.50, did not violate substantive due process. Plaintiffs failed to allege any facts to establish that the law was not designed to further its stated legitimate purposes of raising revenues to close the City's budget gap and deterring smoking by City residents, particularly children. The cigarette excise tax increase enacted by the law had legitimate governmental objectives and a rational basis. &quot;Mixed-motive taxes&quot; may be imposed with the objectives of both raising revenues and deterring a lawful, but disfavored activity, e.g., smoking; nor does a mere high rate of taxation and a stated deterrent purpose render a tax a penalty, where the tax is not imposed on a criminal activity. Moreover, discovery was not necessary to ascertain whether the Mayor, in urging passage of the tax increase, had an alleged &quot;ulterior motive&quot;: the complete elimination of smoking. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Tax on Cigarettes and Tobacco Products -- New York City Excise Tax </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A local law of the City of New York, that raised the excise tax on a pack of cigarettes from 8 &cent; to $ 1.50, did not contravene due process on the theory that it was unreasonably high and, thus, threatened the continued viability of plaintiffs' cigarette distribution businesses within the City. Subject to constitutional inhibitions, the Legislature has very nearly unconstrained authority in the design of taxing impositions. Even a state tax that has the effect of destroying a business must be sustained if it is not invidious. Deterrence of smoking has long been recognized as a legitimate motive for a cigarette tax, and the remedy for an allegedly &quot;oppressive tax&quot; lies with the Legislature, not the judiciary.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The People filed an order in the trial court (New York) to show cause requiring defendant to appear in a lineup pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 249.40(2)(b)(i) after defendant was charged with various offenses. Defendant opposed the motion and alternatively requested that the lineup be held in a double-blind and sequential manner, and that a stenographer and photographer record the lineup proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that there was not good cause for a lineup. The trial court found good cause for the lineup. Defendant's request for a double-blind lineup was denied. The trial court's authority to order that the district attorney employ the sequential and/or double-blind lineup was unsettled, and the trial court was not willing to usurp law enforcement's discretion as long as the procedure was constitutional. The trial court refused to embark on a slippery slope of ruling on future applications based on scientific evidence. Further, given the circumstances of the case, the use of a double-blind sequential lineup would most likely have no impact on the reliability of the identification procedure as the victim had already identified defendant's photograph from a mug shot book. To the extent there had been a misidentification, the damage was irreparable, and the victim would likely again identify defendant in the lineup, whether it be sequential or simultaneous. Given the critical nature of the identification evidence and the apparent weaknesses in the People's case, the People were ordered to furnish a stenographer and photographer to memorialize the lineup proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The People's application was granted to the extent that a lineup was ordered. The trial court further ordered the People to provide defense counsel with notice seven days in advance of the date on which the lineup was scheduled to be held, and to furnish the services of a stenographer and photographer to memorialize the lineup proceedings. Defendant's application for a double-blind, sequential lineup was denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The People, after being granted an order pursuant to CPL 240.40 (2) (b) (i) requiring defendant's participation in a postindictment lineup, were not required to conduct either a double-blind lineup, in which the law enforcement officers conducting the lineup would have no knowledge as to which of the participants was the true suspect, or a sequential lineup, in which the victim would view each potential suspect separately and then make a determination on each individually without ever viewing all the potential suspects simultaneously. It would have been an improper infringement on law enforcement to have ordered the People to employ either lineup methodology as long the simultaneous, non-double-blind lineup procedure had not been declared unconstitutional. Furthermore, given the critical nature of the identification evidence, the People were ordered to furnish a stenographer and photographer to memorialize the lineup proceedings in order to reduce the opportunity for any unintentional suggestiveness from law enforcement personnel. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed a motion, pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.20(1), seeking an order setting aside a sentence that was imposed after he was convicted of rape and sodomy in the first degree. He claimed that the procedures used to sentence him as a discretionary persistent felony offender violated the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in its Apprendi decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of rape and sodomy in the first degree, and the trial court which convicted him determined that he had prior convictions for rape, sodomy, assault and battery, and assault with intent to rob, and it used those convictions to enhance his sentence. After the United States Supreme Court issued its Apprendi decision, defendant filed a motion to set aside his sentence, arguing that the procedures which were used to sentence him as a discretionary persistent felony offender violated the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. The trial court held that (1) although the Court of Appeals of New York reviewed New York's discretionary offender scheme after the United States Supreme Court issued its Apprendi decision and found in its Rosen decision that the scheme was constitutional, the court's Rosen decision conflicted with the Supreme Court's Ring decision and could no longer be considered good law; and (2) because the court of appeals' Rosen decision conflicted with the Supreme Court's Ring decision, the trial court was not required to follow Rosen and it would vacate defendant's sentence and resentence him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was entitled to vacatur of the enhanced sentence imposed upon him as a discretionary persistent felony offender because it was based, in part, upon the factual determination of the sentencing judge under a &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; standard that defendant's history and character and the circumstances of his criminal conduct justified such enhanced sentencing (CPL 400.20 [5]; Penal Law &sect; 70.10 [2]). The procedures used to sentence defendant as a discretionary persistent felony offender were unconstitutional as violative of due process to the extent that the sentencing judge made factual findings beyond defendant's prior convictions that resulted in the enhanced sentence. The United States Supreme Court has determined in cases subsequent to defendant's conviction that all facts essential to the imposition of the level of punishment that a defendant receives must be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff injured party sued defendant housing authority for personal injuries arising from a slip and fall. After the trial court dismissed the injured party's action for a failure to prosecute it, she moved to vacate the dismissal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injured party failed to provide basic discovery demanded by the housing authority. The injured party also repeatedly did not comply with the trial court's orders to file a note of issue by a date certain. The last time she did not comply with such an order, or appear for a conference with the trial court, her claim was dismissed over five years after she filed it. Six years later, she sought to vacate that dismissal. Under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3216, a dismissal of her case for unreasonably neglecting to proceed could not be ordered unless she was served with a written demand by registered or certified mail requiring her to serve and file a note of issue within 90 days. The housing authority never served such a demand on the injured party. Absent that demand, the trial court had no power to dismiss the action. The trial court had no discretion to consider whether the housing authority would be unduly prejudiced by the delay inherent in reinstating the matter.</SPAN></P>

Under CPLR 3216, a court may not dismiss an action where a party unreasonably neglects to proceed in an action unless the court or party seeking dismissal has served a 90-day demand. Absent such notice, a neglectful plaintiff's lawyer is relieved of the burden of showing that the claim has any merit, or even that a reasonable excuse exists for failing to prosecute an action.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant moved to dismiss, on grounds of statutory vagueness, existence of a legal impediment, and as facially insufficient, an information charging him with criminally possessing a hypodermic instrument in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 220.45. He also moved to reserve his right to make further motions as required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested after allegedly being observed shooting heroin in public, but due to evidentiary deficiencies, the charge eventually filed was for misdemeanor unlawful possession of hypodermic instruments. The court first held that even though the definition of unlawful under &sect; 220.45 could only be determined by reference to pharmacy regulatory statutes, specifically N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 3381, it was not unconstitutionally vague, because it was clear that the penal statute would not be enforced against a possessor whose possession complied with &sect; 3381. There was no legal impediment to the information, because the determination whether defendant in fact bought the hypodermic instruments legally would be a matter for trial. The information was facially sufficient without specifically alleging unlawfulness under &sect; 3381. Finally, the prosecution was mistaken in asserting that defendant would bear the burden of showing his possession was legal, because N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 3396, which shifted certain burdens to defendants in drug-related cases, did not apply to prosecutions under the penal laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the motion to dismiss but granted the motion to reserve the right to file further motions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Penal Law &sect; 220.45, which proscribes &quot;knowingly and unlawfully&quot; possessing a hypodermic syringe or needle in violation of article 33 of the Public Health Law, is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant's prosecution for unlawfully possessing two hypodermic needles containing heroin residue. The statute, as written, sufficiently specified the type of behavior considered unlawful so as to eliminate the danger of arbitrary and discriminatory applications. Furthermore, the fact that the statute cross-references article 33 of the Public Health Law does not render the statute unconstitutionally vague. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Criminally Possessing Hypodermic Instrument -- Exception to Criminal Liability for Needles Purchased at Pharmacy </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The accusatory instrument charging defendant with criminally possessing a hypodermic instrument in violation of Penal Law &sect; 220.45, based upon the arresting officer's observation of &quot;defendant holding in his hand two hypodermic needles containing heroin residue,&quot; was facially sufficient for pleading purposes. The statute proscribes &quot;knowingly and unlawfully&quot; possessing a hypodermic syringe or needle in violation of article 33 of the Public Health Law. Although Penal Law &sect; 220.45, by virtue of the Public Health Law definition of the element &quot;unlawful,&quot; exempts from criminal liability persons over 18 years old who purchase less than 10 hypodermic instruments from a pharmacy (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Public Health Law &sect; 3381 [6]), the People were not required to plead in the accusatory instrument that defendant did not purchase the subject needles at a pharmacy. Since the exception to criminal liability is found outside of the Penal Law, it is treated as a proviso, rather than as a true exception, and is not required to be pleaded. However, the People still bear the burden of proving at trial that defendant did not purchase the needles at a pharmacy. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property's prior owner reached a settlement with the assessor regarding the property's tax assessment. After the property was transferred to the taxpayer, the applicable equalization rate declined, and the taxpayer sought to apply the lower rate, but such a change was precluded by N.Y. Real Prop.

Const. art. XVI, &sect; 2, and (2) it was at least arguable that the taxpayer was not wholly unconnected to the property's prior owner, as the taxpayer had been sole shareholder of the property's lessee when the prior owner owned it. Therefore, the case in which N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 727 was found inapplicable was distinguishable, and it was not appropriate to declare &sect; 727 inapplicable to the instant case.

Although petitioner alleged that there was a 27% decline in the equalization rate from 2000 to 2002, which would have caused the property's 2002 assessment to be in excess of its full market value, RPTL 727 does not list fluctuations in equalization rates as one of its stated exceptions. The assessment being challenged was not in excess of constitutional limits, and petitioner, a corporation owned by the same person who owned the corporation previously leasing the property, was not a transferee who had absolutely no connection whatsoever to the assessment reduction at issue. Both of those factors must exist in order to defeat RPTL 727.  </SPAN></P>

The record revealed that others had indicated that defendant was not the shooter and he had an alibi witness as well. Thereafter, defendant filed a motion to vacate the judgment. A hearing was held on the newly discovered evidence claim, as well as on possible Brady violations and a free-standing claim of innocence. Defendant presented four eyewitnesses who indicated that he was not the shooter, as well as a taped recantation of earlier witnesses who had identified him as the shooter. The court found that the evidence was not shown to have been newly discovered, nor was it shown that it was undiscoverable prior to trial if due diligence had been exercised. The court also found that the Brady claims lacked merit because there was no showing that exculpatory evidence which defendant was unaware of had been withheld. The court found that conviction and incarceration of an innocent person violated N.Y. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 5, 6, and that defendant could claim free-standing innocence.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant, who was convicted of manslaughter in 1987, may raise a free-standing claim of actual innocence as a ground for postconviction relief pursuant to CPL article 440. While the incarceration of an actual innocent person is not violative of the Federal Constitution so long as the jurisdiction provides for a pardon based upon innocence (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executive Law &sect; 19), the conviction and continued incarceration of an actual innocent person is violative of the New York Constitution. CPL 440.10 (1) (h) provides a basis for vacating a judgment obtained in violation of an accused's constitutional rights. A defendant claiming actual innocence must establish by clear and convincing evidence, considering the trial and hearing evidence and any other reliable evidence whether in admissible form or not, that no reasonable juror could have voted to convict. Here, although defendant demonstrated that he is probably innocent, he failed to meet his burden of proof by the requisite clear and convincing evidence. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff adult businesses moved in two separate actions for preliminary injunctive relief against enforcement by defendants, the city and certain officials, of New York City, N.Y., Zoning Reg. &sect; 11-113, as amended in 2001, and to consolidate their actions. The city and officials moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Before its amendment, the zoning regulation had placed severe limitations only on those establishments that devoted a substantial portion (judicially interpreted as 40 percent or more of floor space) to adult pursuits, but the 2001 amendment removed the &quot;substantial portion&quot; language. When the businesses challenged the amendment as placing an unreasonable limitation on freedom of expression under the First Amendment and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, the court noted that while freedom of speech could be limited in the public interest, any limitation had to be narrowly tailored to address the harms to be avoided. While the earlier version of the ordinance had been justified by various studies showing harms caused by proximity to adult businesses, the newer, more stringent limitations could not be justified by that same research. Collateral estoppel did not apply, because earlier cases addressed the earlier version of the statute. The defense claim of laches was mooted by the businesses' success on the merits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court consolidated the actions, denied the city and officials' motion for summary judgment, and granted summary judgment in favor of the adult businesses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law--Freedom of Speech--Zoning Amendment Geographically Restricting Adult Entertainment Establishments</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2001 amendments to New York City's Zoning Resolution, which removed the phrase &quot;susantial portion&quot; from the definition of &quot;adult establishment,&quot; thereby barring businesses containing any adult entertainment from operating within 500 feet of a church or school in areas where adult establishments are otherwise permitted, constitute an invalid exercise of the zoning power to regulate constitutionally protected expression. Defendants failed to make the requste showing that there is a rational basis for the additional restrictions to the zoning ordinance. The preamendment ordinance validly regulated the location of adult establishments pusant to a 60/40 allocation to determine whether a &quot;susantial portion&quot; of a facility was being used for adult entertainment purposes. The 2001 amendments were purportedly intended to address the problem of sham compliance with the 1995 ordinance. However, defendants failed to demonstrate that the 2001 amendments were narrowly tailored to address the adverse secondary effects caused by adult establishments set forth in the 1993 report that formed the basis of the 1995 ordinance. New evidence is necessary to demonstrate a rational basis for the 2001 amendments and that the 60/40 adult establishments are not the appropriately narrow solution to remedy the secondary effects. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff non-party-affiliated voters instituted a declaratory judgment action to challenge the constitutionality of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The voters claimed that the ban on write-in votes under N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 8-308(2), the limit under N.Y. Elec.

The state attorney general was allowed to intervene and was granted his motion to dismiss as to the attack on N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 8-308. The court held that the voters' claim in that regard was legally insufficient because they did not attack the ballot access provisions of the law, such provisions were presumptively constitutional, and bans on write-in voting were permissible if the ballot access laws were otherwise constitutional. However, the court declared that N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 8-302 was unconstitutional to the extent it conflicted with a rule adopted by the Independence Party allowing non-party-affiliated voters to vote in their primary elections. The ruling did not require anything more than allowing those registered to vote without party enrollment to participate in primary elections to nominate Independence Party candidates for the specified public offices.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judgments -- Res Judicata -- Constitutionality of Closed Primary System</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Plaintiffs, independent voters whose federal action challenging the constitutionality of New York's closed primary system (Election Law &sect; 8-302 [4]) was dismissed, were not barred by the doctrine of res judicata from again challenging the constitutionality of that system in state court. The First Amendment protects a political party's right to invite independents to participate in its primary. At the time the federal court action was decided, no recognized New York political party had adopted a rule opening its primary to independent voters. However, since the Independence Party thereafter adopted a rule inviting those registered to vote without party enrollment to participate in primary elections to nominate Independence Party candidates for certain public offices in conflict with the state law, res judicata did not bar this declaratory judgment action. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Elections -- Write-in Votes -- Constitutional Challenge to Limited Ban on Write-in Voting</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Plaintiffs' constitutional challenge to the limited ban on write-in voting in primary and general elections with regard to any person whose name already appears on the voting machine as a nominated or designated candidate for public office (Election Law &sect; 8-308 [2]) is dismissed as legally insufficient. Bans on write-in voting are permissible if the state's ballot access laws are otherwise constitutional. Plaintiffs did not attack the ballot access provisions of the Election Law. Since the unchallenged ballot access provisions are presumptively constitutional, by challenging only the limitation on write-in voting, plaintiffs did not raise a bona fide controversy.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Elections -- Primary Elections -- Constitutionality of Closed Primary System -- Validity of Registration Form</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In a declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of New York's closed primary system (Election Law &sect; 8-302 [4]), plaintiffs' constitutional challenge to the voter registration form, which contained a notice that voting in a primary election required enrollment in a political party (Election Law &sect; 5-210 [5] [f]), was dismissed. Even if the notice was incorrect, the form itself did not deprive anyone of a constitutional right to vote in a primary. The proper procedure for remedying any deficiency in the content of the form was a CPLR article 78 proceeding against the administrative body charged with producing the form.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Elections -- Primary Elections -- Constitutionality of Closed Primary System</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. New York's closed primary system, which requires party enrollment as a prerequisite to voter participation in a party primary (Election Law &sect; 8-302 [4]), is unconstitutional only insofar as it conflicts with a rule adopted by the Independence Party allowing registered voters without any party enrollment to participate in primary elections to nominate Independence Party candidates for certain public offices. The First Amendment protects a political party's right to invite independents to participate in its primary. There is no state interest in conducting a closed primary system sufficient to justify interference with the associational rights of a political party opting for an open primary. Thus, in the absence of a conflict with those rights, there is no state interest sufficient to justify impingement of an independent voter's right to vote in a primary to which they have been invited.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, the Local Government Assistance Corporation (LGAC) and the Division of the Budget of the State of New York, sought a preliminary injunction to enjoin defendants, the City of New York and the Sales Tax Asset Receivable Corporation (STARC), from issuing bonds or otherwise implementing the provisions of the Municipal Assistance Corporation Refinancing Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because the City needed to ease the fiscal burden of large bond payments over the next five years, the state legislature passed the Act, which added a new statutory section, N.Y. Pub. Auth. Laws &sect; 3238-a, and which amended an existing statutory section, N.Y. Pub. Auth. Laws &sect; 3240. The Act authorized 30 years of payments and charged LGAC with the task of channeling the payments from a portion of the State's sales tax. Plaintiffs sought to enjoin defendants from implementing the Act on the basis that it involved an unconstitutional multi-year obligation because it had not subjected the annual payments to a referendum or to an appropriation by the legislature. The court denied plaintiffs' motion. N.Y. Pub. Auth. Laws &sect; 3238-a required that payments to the City be made in accordance with N.Y. State Fin. Law &sect; 92-r, which required an appropriation prior to payment. Although the legislature had modified N.Y. Pub. Auth. Laws &sect; 3240(5), it left intact &sect; 3240(3), which required that payments to the LGAC be appropriated. In addition, the City could only assign to STARC what had already been appropriated. Plaintiffs had failed to show that the Act impaired the rights of bondholders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Municipal Assistance Corporation Refinancing Act</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC) Refinancing Act (L 2003, ch 62, part A4; ch 63, part V), which replaced the $ 2.5 billion in New York City MAC bonds scheduled to become due in 2008 with 30 years of payments by directing plaintiff Local Government Assistance Corporation (LGAC) to pay to the City of New York $ 170 million annually from the Local Government Tax Assistance Fund until 2034 (Public Authorities Law &sect;&sect; 3238-a, 3240), is facially unconstitutional. Thus, they are not entitled to a preliminary injunction preventing its implementation. The MAC Refinancing Act further authorizes the Mayor of the City of New York to assign any or all of the annual payments received from the Fund to a newly formed nonprofit corporation (the Sales Tax Asset Receivable Corporation [STARC]), which is authorized to issue bonds to the public. The Refinancing Act is not violative of NY Constitution article VII for failing to subject the $ 170 million annual payments to a referendum or annual appropriation by the Legislature. The act requires that payments from the Fund to the City be made in accordance with State Finance Law &sect; 92-r, which requires a legislative appropriation prior to payment. Furthermore, the assignment of the City's payments to STARC is not an unconstitutional gift or loan by the City without a pledge of full faith and credit (NY Const, art VIII, &sect;&sect; 1, 2). In addition, the act does not unconstitutionally impinge upon pledges to LGAC's bondholders. </SPAN></P>

The cases cited by the adoptive parents were based on a finding that the best interest of the child required the biological father be equitably estopped from asserting paternity where the father had delayed asserting paternity and where a parent/child bond had developed with the non-biological father. In the statutes regulating adoption, however, the legislature had not included language establishing &quot;equitable estoppel against the assertion of paternity&quot; as a defense against a biological father seeking to contest the adoption, where the biological father had allegedly delayed or failed to assert parental commitment to the child. Rather, the legislature had set forth specific guidelines under which a court had to determine whether consent to the adoption by the biological father was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The child's father was deceased. The child's parents were never married to each other. The mother urged the trial court to find &sect; 72, as applied, unconstitutional. The mother's principle argument was that under &sect; 72 when one parent died both sets of grandparents were given standing to move for visitation. The mother argued that while it might make sense to give the parents of the deceased standing, it made no sense to give both sets of grandparents automatic standing. The mother contended that, as a result, the statute was the kind of sweepingly broad statute previously held unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court. To meet constitutional muster a nonparent visitation statute had to be applied in a manner that recognized the presumption that fit parents acted in the best interest of their children and that the trial court had to accord some special weight to the parents' own determination. The New York appellate courts had previously held that &sect; 72 could be interpreted to accord deference to a parent's decision. Thus, &sect; 72 properly afforded the mother the appropriate deference, while still giving the grandparents standing to bring a visitation petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a courtroom television network, sought a declaratory judgment that N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 52, which in part prohibited the televising of judicial proceedings in which a witness might testify, was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. I and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The network moved for partial summary judgment, and defendants, the State of New York and the Governor, cross-moved for summary judgment to dismiss the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The network argued that N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 52 effected an unconstitutional closure of the courtroom by prohibiting audio-visual coverage of trials and that the court should apply strict scrutiny to the statute. The court disagreed. Audio-visual coverage of court proceedings was neither prohibited nor required under the First Amendment. Thus, a court could impose reasonable restrictions on audio-visual coverage, and a rule barring audio-visual coverage of trial proceedings was a time, place, and manner restriction on speech subject to rational basis scrutiny. The record developed during New York's 10-year experiment with televising court proceedings under expired N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 218 contained ample evidence from which the legislature could rationally conclude that N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 52 advanced the State's interest in fair trials. The legislature could also reasonably find that its legitimate interest in fair trials outweighed the benefits of permitting camera coverage, even on a discretionary basis. The combined effect of New York's statutory scheme demonstrated that, while public access was guaranteed, fair trial rights took precedence when there was a conflict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the network's motion for partial summary judgment, granted defendants' motions for summary judgment, and declared that the statute was constitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Civil Rights Law &sect; 52, which prohibits audiovisual coverage of trial court proceedings, does not effect an unconstitutional closure of the courtroom in violation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. The constitutional right of the press and public to attend court proceedings does not give rise to a constitutional right to televise or otherwise broadcast court proceedings. Rather, a rule barring audiovisual coverage of trial proceedings is a time, place, and manner restriction on speech subject to rational basis scrutiny. Such a rule is constitutional if it is reasonable, promotes &quot;significant governmental interests,&quot; and does not unwarrantedly abridge the opportunities for the communication of thought. The Legislature could rationally conclude, following a 10-year experiment with discretionary audiovisual coverage of court proceedings (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Judiciary Law &sect; 218; 22 NYCRR 131.1 [b]), that the statutory ban on audiovisual coverage advances the State's interest in fair trials.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of kidnapping and related crimes. The trial court sentenced defendant to a term of 20 years to life imprisonment. Upon defendant's release from prison to lifetime parole, pursuant to the New York Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA), N.Y. Correct. Law &sect; 168 et seq., defendant was duly classified as a Level 1 Sex Offender. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of SORA as applied to him and moved for reargument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and his accomplices attempted to rob a man. The man fled, but left his three-year-old daughter behind. Defendant and his accomplices took the child and then concocted a scheme to blackmail the man and his wife. When this effort was foiled, the men were arrested, and the child was recovered without harm. None of defendant's actions in kidnapping the child were done for the purpose of sexual victimization of the child, and there was no assertion that during the period in which she was held for ransom the child was in any way molested or sexually abused. Defendant argued that because the purpose of SORA was to identify and protect the public from sexual offenders and predators - and he was neither - SORA, as applied to him, was an unconstitutional violation of the constitutional guarantee of substantive due process. The court found that to require defendant to register as a sex offender was completely arbitrary and unreasonable. SORA as applied to defendant violated the Equal Protection and the Due Process clauses of both the United States and the New York Constitutions. Therefore, defendant was not properly subject to classification and registration under SORA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The motion to reargue was granted and, upon reargument, the motion to declare the statute unconstitutional as applied to defendant was granted. Accordingly, the New York Division of Parole was permanently enjoined from requiring defendant to register, placing him in their special offender unit, or in any other manner treating him as a sexual offender.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Subjecting defendant to the classification and registration provisions of the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) because of his conviction of kidnapping in the first degree involving a child (Correction Law &sect; 168-a [2] [a]; Penal Law &sect; 135.25) prior to the enactment of the SORA was not violative of the Ex Post Facto Clause (U.S. Const., art I, &sect; 10 [1]). The Ex Post Facto Clause applies only to penal statutes. Sex offender registration laws are not intended as criminal punishments or enhancements, but are essentially civil in nature. Consequently, application of the SORA to a person convicted of a crime cannot be a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Substantive Due Process -- Application of Sex Offender Registration Act Where Registrable Offense Contains No Sexual Component</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) was unconstitutional as applied to defendant as violative of his right to substantive due process of law, where he was classified and registered as a sex offender because of his conviction of kidnapping in the first degree involving a child (Correction Law &sect; 168-a [2] [a]; Penal Law &sect; 135.25), even though the crime was committed without any sexual motivation or purpose. Application of the SORA implicates a fundamental liberty interest. Defendant demonstrated that his statutorily mandated registration as a sex offender was unreasonable and arbitrary, and bore no rational relationship to the purposes of the statute of protecting the community from the dangers of recidivism by sex offenders and assisting law enforcement in the investigation and prosecution of sex offenders. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection of Laws -- Application of Sex Offender Registration Act Where Registrable Offense Contains No Sexual Component</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. The automatic application of the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) to defendant based upon his conviction of kidnapping in the first degree involving a child (Correction Law &sect; 168-a [2] [a]; Penal Law &sect; 135.25), even though the crime was committed without any sexual motivation or purpose, was violative of equal protection. There is no rational relationship between classification and registration of nonsex offenders such as defendant and the otherwise legitimate governmental interests of the SORA. Whenever a defendant is convicted of a registrable offense that does not contain a sexual component, a hearing must be held at which evidence must be presented of some sexual facet to the defendant's actions or motivations sufficient to sustain a classification as a sex offender. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After claimants, a psychiatric patient and his guardian, filed a claim for personal injuries against defendant, the State of New York, the State filed a counterclaim for the cost of various services provided to the patient and moved for partial summary judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient, who began to complain of pain to his face, jaw, and eye, alleged that his complaint went untreated, that a brain infection resulted, and that he required several surgeries. Claimants sued for damages, alleging negligence and malpractice by the psychiatric center's personnel. The State's answer contained a counterclaim, pursuant to N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 43.03, for the cost of services provided to the patient for a period of several years. The court granted the State's counterclaim, denied claimants' motion to dismiss, and denied claimants' cross-motion for leave to amend. The case on which claimants relied in their motion to dismiss had erroneously concluded that because the &quot;ability to pay&quot; was a condition precedent to liability under the Mental Hygiene Law, the State effectively had no independent cause of action for contribution where plaintiffs were indigent. The State was seeking not contribution but recovery by way of a setoff from an asset of the patient, namely, his underlying personal injury action. Where the State sought recovery against a litigant's assets, the financial ability to pay was not a condition precedent to liability.</SPAN></P>

The patient's &quot;ability to pay&quot; at the time the services were rendered is not a condition precedent to the State's statutory and common-law right to seek recovery from an asset of the patient. Furthermore, the proscription against contingent counterclaims is inapplicable where the issues in the underlying action and in the counterclaim are intermingled, and where the prospect of two separate trials would engender confusion, unnecessary expense and a waste of judicial economy. </SPAN></P>

The liquidated damages provision related to this part of the contract was plainly, and grossly, disproportionate to any probable actual harm or loss and was a penalty which would not be enforced. The city did not show any actual damages, at the time the parties entered into the agreement, that would justify, in the event of a breach, the sum allowed under the liquidated damages provision. That sum was not an estimate of the extent of injury the city would suffer, nor did the city's plan set forth any probable actual damages or the extent of injury to the city if the plan's goal's were not met.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The liquidated damages clause of a municipal public works contract assessing a financial penalty on a prime contractor for failing to comply with an affirmative action utilization plan for hiring subcontractors is an unenforceable penalty.  The contractual provision for damages in the sum of 125% of any shortfall of the utilization plan is grossly disproportionate to the probable actual harm or loss.  Plaintiff municipality failed to demonstrate any probable actual damages that would justify the sum allowed under the liquidated damages provision in the event of a breach.  The municipal employees charged with enforcing the plan goals could not state any reason or basis for the calculation of damages or specify the damages caused to the city if a prime contractor failed to satisfy the hiring requirements. Moreover, the fact that the liquidated damages clause is intended to achieve a public benefit is insufficient to render the clause enforceable. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The minor daughter had a history of running away while being declared a person in need of supervision and a delinquent. Pursuant to N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 720(2), the court could not place the child in secure detention for contempt for violating the court's orders. The court found &sect; 720(2) to be unconstitutional because it improperly infringed upon the court's powers to place the child in secure detention and because the statute was not in the child's best interests. Furthermore, the statute did not violate the provisions of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 5633 so that the State would still be able to receive the formula grants under that section.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Family Court Act &sect; 720 (2), which prohibits a child adjudged to be a person in need of supervision (PINS) from being placed in a secure detention facility for any reason, is unconstitutional as violative of the Family Court's inherent power to punish for contempt any disregard of judicial authority.  Family Court, having been granted exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over PINS proceedings (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Family Ct Act &sect; 115 [a] [v]), cannot be deprived of the power to enforce, implement and effect the policy and goals inherent in that jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff attempted buyer sued defendants, the owner and the owner's attorney. The owner filed cross-claims against her attorney for malpractice, gross negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, indemnity, and miscalculation of taxes. The attorney moved to dismiss the cross-claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner was going to sell her cooperative apartment to the buyer. The attorney was representing her in the transaction. The buyer advanced funds for the transaction that the attorney placed in escrow in a bank. However, the parties did not complete the transaction and the owner sold the apartment to another party. The other party also advanced funds for the transaction, which the attorney placed in escrow in the bank. When the attorney sought to withdraw the funds from the bank, the attorney was unable to do so because the bank was closed and in receivership. The attorney was only able to recover about a third of the funds. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss the cross-claims seeking lost interest as a result of the alleged malpractice of the attorney in drafting contracts providing for the escrowed monies to be held in interest on lawyer accounts. Further, the alleged conduct did not approach the standard for gross negligence. Additionally, the claims of breach of fiduciary duty and the claim for indemnity were duplicative of the legal malpractice causes of action. Finally, the claim regarding the calculation of taxes was dismissed, as a refund was obtainable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant attorney, who represented the seller in the sale of two cooperative apartments and drafted the contracts of sale, may be held liable in legal malpractice for any loss of monies resulting from depositing, as escrowee pending the closings, $2.7 million in a small bank that failed prior to the closings. The complaint sufficiently sets forth a viable claim that it was malpractice for defendant to have drafted contracts providing that the escrow monies be deposited without protection beyond the $100,000 per account Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance. Plaintiff is entitled to have the opportunity to offer expert opinion that in so drafting the agreements defendant deviated from generally accepted standards for real estate practitioners.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant attorney, who represented the seller in the sale of two cooperative apartments and drafted the contracts of sale, may be held liable in legal malpractice for the loss of interest resulting from his having deposited escrow funds in excess of $2.7 million in a noninterest bearing IOLA account pending the closings. An attorney, acting in a fiduciary capacity, may deposit &quot;qualified funds,&quot; &quot;nominal in amount or expected to be held for a short period of time,&quot; in a noninterest bearing IOLA account, and may not be held liable in damages because of such a deposit &quot;pursuant to a judgment in good faith that such monies were qualified funds&quot; (Judiciary Law &sect; 497). The complaint herein sufficiently alleges that the significant amounts of monies deposited by defendant as escrowee do not constitute &quot;qualified funds&quot; as defined by the statute.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">There was no evidence the inmate was a substance abuser. The Eighth Amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause prohibited deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. This indifference was manifested in the doctors' response to his needs by intentionally denying or delaying access to medical care and intentionally interfering with prescribed treatment. The inmate's diagnosis showed his medical needs were sufficiently serious. He showed the officials and physicians acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind, as they knew of and disregarded an excessive risk to his health. It was improper to deny the inmate medical treatment without medical justification, and the required drug treatment program was irrelevant for the inmate and provided no medical justification for a continued denial of medical treatment. The officials' policy of requiring participation in drug treatment to receive Hepatitis C treatment, as applied to the inmate, was arbitrary and capricious and resulted in a deliberate denial of medical attention to his serious medical condition in violation of the Eighth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff charitable organizations moved for summary judgment granting them relief from a gross receipts assessment issued by defendant State and its officials. The State cross-moved to dismiss the complaint. The issue was whether N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2807-d(2)(b)(vi) (2002) repealed a tax exemption enjoyed by charitable corporations, thus violating N.Y. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The nonprofit organizations were hospitals pursuant to N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2801. The nonprofit organizations claimed that by applying the assessment to charitable entities, the statute effectively, but unconstitutionally, repealed one or more exemptions. Although the assessment imposed by N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2807-d (2002) was a tax on the nonprofit organizations' income, it was not an unlawful tax on a tax-exempt entity, since the nonprofit organizations did not fall within any exemption to the assessment imposed by &sect; 2807-d. The court held it could not construe a policy that protected charitable corporations from taxation as giving protection to the charitable organizations at issue absent a specific constitutional or statutory enactment of that policy. There was no constitutional provision which provided a general exemption for charities from taxation. The charitable organizations failed to specify any tax exemption rooted in a general law which was effectively repealed by &sect; 2807-d(2)(b)(vi) and thus did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the assessment violated N.Y. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The constitutional validity of the statute was upheld. Summary judgment for the State was granted on all causes of action and the complaint was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health - Nursing Homes - Constitutionality of Assessment on Gross Receipts </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The imposition of a six percent assessment on the gross receipts of residential health care facilities (Public Health Law &sect; 2807-d [2] [b] [vi]) does not repeal a statutorily enacted tax exemption granted to plaintiffs, nonprofit nursing homes, and therefore does not violate the constitutional prohibition against repealing tax exemptions extended by general laws to the real or personal property of charitable organizations (NY Const, art XVI, &sect; 1).  Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate the &quot;statutory source of the claimed exemption&quot; that is allegedly being repealed. Although plaintiffs are exempt from certain taxes, such as income, franchise and sales taxes (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;26 USC &sect; 501 [c] [3]; Tax Law &sect;&sect; 208, 1116 [a] [4]; 20 NYCRR 1-3.4 [b] [6]), there is no statutory prohibition on the imposition of a gross receipts tax. The State's &quot;policy&quot; favoring the exemption from taxation of charitable institutions does not constitute an exemption from a specific tax created by a general law. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Sex Offenders--Enhanced Sentencing for Repeat Child Sex Offenders--Use of Special Information to Plead Victim's Age Constitutional </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In defendant's prosecution for first degree sexual abuse for having subjected the victim to &quot;sexual contact by forcible compulsion&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 130.65), the People were not required to instruct the grand jury regarding the victim's age as an element of the crime before filing a special information pursuant to CPL 200.62 for enhanced sentencing purposes.  New York's enhanced sentencing scheme for repeat child sex offenders authorizes the victim's age to be pleaded by special information whenever a person is charged with a sex offense for which the victim's age is not an element of the offense.  Under the statutory scheme, the victim's age, unless conceded by the defendant, must be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. A factual finding by the jury that the victim is under 15, coupled with a determination that the defendant was previously convicted of a child sex offense, subjects the defendant to an enhanced penalty for the present crime (Penal Law &sect; 70.07 [4] [e]; &sect; 70.06 [3] [d]), as well as to an enhanced penalty for any future child sex crime. The use of a special information as a means of submitting the victim's age to the trial jury does not violate federal or state constitutional requirements.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In defendant's prosecution for second degree murder, intervenor media organizations sought permission to take still photography or to record and broadcast the proceedings, and a declaratory judgment that N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 52, regarding media coverage of judicial proceedings, was unconstitutional. The State and amicus curiae United States objected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 52 prohibited televising, broadcasting, or taking motion pictures of judicial proceedings. The legislature had experimented with allowing cameras in the courts, but those experiments were ended and &sect; 52 was allowed to once again take effect. The public's right of access to a criminal trial was not absolute, and defendant's right to a public trial did not encompass the use of cameras in the courtroom. The media organizations did not show they had a constitutional right to bring cameras into the courtroom. The legislature clearly intended to ban cameras from the courts. While cameras could be constitutionally permitted in the courtroom, the ban on their use was not unconstitutional. The fact that neither defendant nor the People objected to video coverage was not controlling. Section 52's ban did not apply to still photography, and such photography would not adversely affect defendant's rights to a fair trial and due process. The use of still cameras was governed by N.Y. Stands. &amp; Admin. Policies, R. Chief Adm'r Cts. &sect; 131.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applications for declaratory judgment were denied and dismissed and permission to videotape and/or televise defendant's judicial proceedings was denied.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Civil Rights Law &sect; 52, which prohibits the &quot;televising, broadcasting, or taking of motion pictures&quot; in New York courtrooms, is constitutional. There is no federal or state constitutional right to televise or videotape trial proceedings.  The right to a public trial does not encompass the use of video cameras in the courtroom. However, still photography is not covered by the statutory prohibition.  The trial judge has broad discretion to determine whether to permit still photography in the courtroom (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rules of Chief Administrator of Courts [22 NYCRR] part 131).  Accordingly, still photographic coverage will be permitted during defendant's murder trial for the shooting death of an abortion provider, subject to any reasonable restrictions the court may impose after consultation with the applicant and the parties.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff lawyers' association filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment and a motion for a permanent injunction against defendants, the City and the State of New York, for their failure to increase the compensation rates for assigned counsel with respect to portions of N.Y. County Law &sect; 722-b, N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 245, and N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 35, which allegedly caused ineffective representation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The declaratory judgment action alleged that due to inadequate compensation fees paid to assigned counsel in criminal and family court matters, there was a shortage of available attorneys to be assigned. This resulted in a lack of counsel in many matters and at many stages of those types of proceedings, including juvenile and parental rights termination matters. The court found that this resulted in an obstruction of the judiciary's ability to function, and accordingly, it held that N.Y. County Law &sect; 722-b, N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 245, and N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 35 were unconstitutional as applied to assigned counsel cases because assigned counsel was necessary and there was an insufficient number available, which resulted in delays and denials of counsel, all of which was directly due to the current inadequate compensation. The court directed a set amount paid per hour, without distinction between in-court and out-of-court work, and without caps on each case, pending further legislative action to correct the situation. The court noted that an adequate compensation scheme with set increases within a statute would prevent this type of situation. The elements for an injunction were satisfied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the association's motion and issued a mandatory permanent injunction and directed a payment of $ 90 per hour to assigned counsel, without distinction between in-court and out-of-court work, and without a cap on each case, pending further action on the issue by the legislature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney and Client--Assignment of Counsel--Compensation </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statutory compensation rates paid to assigned counsel in criminal matters and Family Court proceedings (County Law &sect; 722-b; Family Ct Act &sect; 245; Judiciary Law &sect; 35) are unconstitutional as applied to the representation of children and indigent adults in the City of New York.  The State's failure to increase the compensation rates for assigned counsel since 1985 violates the constitutional and statutory right to meaningful and effective representation. The current inadequate statutory rates have resulted in a critical shortage of assigned counsel, which in turn has resulted in denial of counsel, delay in proceedings and excessive case loads, thereby seriously impairing the ability of the courts to function.  Until the Legislature addresses the issue, plaintiff bar association is granted a mandatory permanent injunction raising the compensation rates to $90 an hour, consistent with the federal assigned counsel rate, without a ceiling on total per case compensation or a distinction between in- and out-of-court work.  The distinction between the compensation for in- and out-of-court work creates an economic disincentive for lawyers to perform adequate investigations and seek speedy disposition of all cases.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed a motion to set aside a verdict of guilty to depraved indifference murder, based on his claims that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.25 was unconstitutional as applied to him and that his double jeopardy or collateral estoppel rights were violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Grand Jury determined that defendant should not be indicted for intentional murder, but an indictment was issued for depraved indifference murder. Evidence at trial revealed that the dead body of the victim was found, that the death was caused by a combination of beating and asphyxiation, and that defendant admitted that he lost control and could not think properly. Defendant was convicted, but sentence had not yet been determined. The court denied defendant's post-trial motion to set aside the guilty verdict, holding that double jeopardy did not apply to Grand Jury proceedings and that collateral estoppel did not apply to a vote of a &quot;no true bill&quot; by a Grand Jury. The court noted that defendant's &quot;as applied&quot; challenge to equal protection was to be determined on a case by case basis and found no merit to the claim. The court disagreed with the federal decision of Jones v. Keane and held that identical elements of two types of homicide did not constitute a violation of equal protection, absent a showing of actual racial or other discrimination based upon a suspect classification, which was not found in the instant matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied defendant's motion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Depraved Indifference Murder - Reckless Manslaughter </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Merely because reckless manslaughter and depraved indifference murder are similar, their alleged identical elements do not violate equal protection guarantees.  Differentiating those two different degrees of homicide has never been a problem; nor has there been any abuse by the prosecution or a jury in alleging or finding depraved indifference homicide where intentional homicide is warranted.  Accordingly, in a homicide prosecution in which defendant was found guilty of depraved indifference murder, defendant's motion to set aside the verdict is denied.  Defendant's beating of the victim and the act causing his asphyxiation clearly could have been reckless in light of the defendant's statements that he lost control and could not think properly.  There is nothing unreasonable or vague that would not give a reasonable person notice that those circumstances create a grave risk of death. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, a woman, sought to challenge in an N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding a decision of respondent New York State Division of Human Rights (DHR) that dismissed her sex discrimination complaint against respondent, a local lodge of a national benevolent order, with a finding of no probable cause after investigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the all-male lodge turned down her membership application, the woman argued that although it was a private club exempt under N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 292(9) from discrimination legislation, the lodge was not following the policies of its own national organization. She filed a complaint with DHR, which later conceded that it had never investigated her complaint, since it lacked jurisdiction over the lodge. The decision communicated to the woman, however, was that her claim had failed on the merits. The court held that the failure to advise the woman of the real reason for dismissal, and to advise her that her election of an administrative remedy under N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 297(9) had been annulled (which would have enabled her to pursue a judicial remedy), made the administrative decision arbitrary and capricious. For the time being, a judicial remedy was premature, because until a proper dismissal for lack of jurisdiction occurred, the administrative proceeding would not be properly concluded.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Respondent State Division of Human Rights acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it notified petitioner that it was dismissing her gender discrimination claim against a benevolent order based on a finding of no probable cause, instead of for lack of jurisdiction by reason of the statutory privacy exemption for benevolent orders (Executive Law &sect; 292 [9]).  Respondent has an affirmative duty to clearly and specifically advise a petitioner that a determination dismissing a complaint is jurisdictional and not on the merits.  Consequently, respondent was required to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, and to issue an annulment of the election of remedies (Executive Law &sect; 297 [9]), thereby allowing petitioner to pursue other remedies.  The statute of limitations for commencing a CPLR article 78 proceeding will be tolled until respondent annuls the election of remedies, leaving petitioner several weeks for the commencement of a timely proceeding against the benevolent order.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff first landlord brought a nonpayment proceeding against defendant first tenant, and plaintiff second landlord brought a holdover proceeding against defendant second tenant. Both tenants defaulted, and the landlords each sought a money judgment by default against their respective tenants under N.Y. Real Prop. Acts. Law &sect; 732(3). The instant court consolidated the cases for purposes of its opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After four duly diligent but failed attempts at personal service, a process server affected conspicuous service by affixing a petition and notice of petition on the first tenant's door, and she was sent the pleadings by first class and certified mail. She failed to answer. An order granting possession but not money was entered, but a warrant of eviction was never executed. After a process server served the first tenant, the first landlord moved for a money judgment. The court held the first landlord had been entitled to judgment all along, because when conspicuous service conformed to the due-diligence standard of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 308(4) and N.Y. Real Prop. Acts. Law &sect; 735(1), the landlord was not obliged to bring separate proceedings for possession and money. The second landlord's process server served the petition and notice of petition under &sect; 735(1) by substitute service -- that is, on a person of &quot;suitable age and discretion&quot; living at the second tenant's home. The court held that as substituted service equaled in-hand personal delivery in summary proceedings, the court had personal jurisdiction to grant a default money judgment for the arrears after the tenant defaulted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court awarded a money judgment for the rent, but only the rent, demanded in the first landlord's petition. The court awarded only the rent demanded in the second landlord's nonpayment petition and the use and occupancy through the holdover inquest date.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landlord and Tenant - Summary Proceedings - Default Money Judgment Allowed for Substituted or Duly Diligent Conspicuous Service </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In order to avoid unnecessary duplicative litigation, a court in a nonpayment summary proceeding may award a money judgment against a tenant who defaults after receiving a petition and notice of petition by substituted or duly diligent conspicuous-place service in accordance with CPLR 308 and RPAPL 735 (1).  Substituted and duly diligent conspicuous service are the equivalent of personal delivery in summary proceedings, and are thus sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction to support a money judgment against a defaulting tenant. No constitutional, statutory or practical reason prevents substituted service and conspicuous service from conferring personal jurisdiction in summary proceedings. Consequently, when substituted service and conspicuous service conform to CPLR 308 and RPAPL 735 (1), a landlord need not bring separate proceedings for possession and money or use and occupancy. However, the money judgment is limited to the amount demanded in the petition and cannot include legal or other fees.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a habeas corpus action, petitioner asked the trial court to declare N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 530.50&nbsp;unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated petitioner's rights to due process of law and equal protection of the law under both the federal and state constitutions because it deprived him of the right to bail or release on his own recognizance pending appeal from his conviction of several sexual offenses committed against a child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">From the time of his arrest on sexual assault charges involving a child-victim, through the conclusion of his trial, petitioner was free on bail and appeared in court as required. He was immediately remanded, without bail, upon the jury's return of guilty verdicts on 14 of the 36 counts of the indictment, including those charging him with rape, sodomy, aggravated sexual abuse, and sexual abuse. Petitioner then commenced a habeas corpus. The trial court found that it was evident that based upon the data included in the legislative history, the question of whether the recidivism rate for individuals convicted of violent sexual offenses against young victims was so substantial that denial of release of such individuals pending appeal was justified was at least a debatable question. As such, petitioner did not sustain his burden of showing that varying treatment of a group was totally unrelated to the legislation. Consequently, his equal protection attack failed. Finally, it could not be credibly denied that protecting young victims from violent sexual assaults was a legitimate legislative goal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The petition was denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bail - Excessive Bail - Denial of Postconviction Bail to Defendants Convicted of Felony Sexual Assault against Minor </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. CPL 530.50, which denies postconviction bail to defendants convicted of a felony sexual assault against a victim less than 18 years old, is not violative of the Eighth Amendment's proscription against excessive bail. There is no federal constitutional right to bail pending appeal after a state court conviction.  Consequently, defendant's Eighth Amendment rights have not been violated by the denial of bail following his conviction of sexual felonies involving a child victim.  Furthermore, defendant is not entitled to release on bail pending appeal under the Federal Bail Reform Act (18 USC &sect; 3143), since the federal statute applies only to federal prosecutions and is thus inapplicable to state court proceedings.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bail - Right to Bail - Constitutionality of Denial of Postconviction Bail to Defendants Convicted of Felony Sexual Assault against Minor </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. CPL 530.50, which denies postconviction bail to only those defendants convicted of a felony sexual assault against a victim less than 18 years old, is not unconstitutional as violative of equal protection of the laws under the &quot;rational relation&quot; test.  In view of the heightened recidivism rate among convicted pedophiles and the high incidence of child victims among victims of serious sexual crimes in general, the statutory classification is rationally related to the legitimate governmental interest of protecting children, a special class of victims, from becoming future victims of violent sexual offenders awaiting appellate review of their convictions.  The fact that the Legislature chose to limit the statute to a small class of convicted felons rather than denying bail to all convicted felons does not render the statute unconstitutional.  Since the potential for recidivist behavior by sexual predators is not &quot;wholly irrelevant&quot; to the Legislature's goal of protecting young children from becoming victims of sexual predators, the legislative decision to deny sexual predators postconviction release does not violate their equal protection rights.  Furthermore, since there is no constitutional right to bail pending appeal, the statute is not violative of due process.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city had posted a notice on the door of the property, stating that the condition of the property required it to be cleaned up, and that if the property was not cleaned up within 24 hours, the city would clean up the property and charge the property owner the cost of doing so. Albany, N.Y., Code &sect; 313-40 authorized this procedure. The court ruled that notice was an essential element of due process of law. The notice needed to be reasonably calculated, under the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action or proceeding and to afford them an opportunity to present their objections. The court held that Albany, N.Y., Code &sect; 313-40 did not take into account the possibility that the property owner did not reside at the property in question. Additionally, 24 hours notice to the property owner, even if he/she resided at the property in question, was not reasonably calculated to apprise the owner of the claims and intentions of the city and to afford the owner an opportunity to present his/her objections. Thus, Albany, N.Y., Code &sect; 313-40 was unconstitutional as it failed to provide reasonable notice and due process of law to a property owner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Plaintiff may recover the &quot;clean up&quot; costs defendant municipality assessed against his property in view of the inadequate prior notices provided by defendant pursuant to municipal ordinance.  The ordinance, which authorizes defendant to charge a property owner for work necessary to correct a violation &quot;detrimental to the public health ... after giving the property owner ... 24 hours' notice, in writing, posted on the property, of the condition of the property&quot; to be corrected, is unconstitutional.  It fails to provide reasonable notice and due process of law to a property owner with regard to the City's findings, and fails to afford the owner the opportunity to present objections and/or correct the problem.  Here, plaintiff never received the notices posted on the property prior to defendant's &quot;clean up,&quot; because the property was not his legal residence. Moreover, even if the property owner lives at the property in question, 24 hours' notice is not enough time to respond to the notice. </SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. art. 78 which sought to set aside an order of respondent New York City Environmental Control Board (New York), made through its Motions and Appeals Unit. The order found that the owner had committed a noise violation of &sect; 24-220(b) of the New York City Administrative Code, N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 24, ch. 2, &sect; 220.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner operated a restaurant and was issued a notice of violation of &sect; 24-220(b) of the New York City Administrative Code, based on a noise complaint. The record revealed that the inspector had testified before the administrative law judge (ALJ) that he could hear music emanating from the restaurant while standing on the sidewalk. The restaurant owner indicated that there was music inside and that it could be heard outside but not from the street. The ALJ determined that a violation had occurred, which was affirmed on administrative appeal to the Board. On further review, the court found that the decision was arbitrary and capricious because two of the five elements necessary to establish such a violation had not been proved. The court found that the owner had successfully rebutted the Board's presumption that the music was for a commercial or business advertising purpose by showing that it was being played for the enjoyment of the patrons and not to attract customers. Additionally, the speakers and sound equipment were not in front of or outside of the building, as required under the Code. Accordingly, there was no proved violation.</SPAN></P>

Any presumption that music made by a sound reproduction device played within a commercial establishment is intended to be for a commercial or business advertising purpose was sufficiently rebutted by petitioner's assertion that music was played for the enjoyment of the patrons and not to attract customers. Respondent cannot rely on a further presumption that the fact that music was permitted to be heard on the street established a business or advertising purpose. Furthermore, respondent failed to demonstrate that there was a device &quot;in front or outside the building,&quot; or that the music was heard &quot;in or through any aperture&quot; of the building as required by the ordinance. The purpose of the ordinance was to ban outside loudspeakers and to prevent the circumvention of such ban by also banning inside loudspeakers playing through a hole in the wall or window or door of the premises.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought to have the court (New York) reconsider its decision that convicted him of murder, claiming, inter alia, that the decision was unconstitutional, and that the prosecution had an affirmative obligation to prove that he was not mentally retarded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 400.27(12) was constitutionally infirm as a result of decisions by the United States Supreme Court. The court held that defendant's arguments were premised upon the misconception that the prosecution had an affirmative obligation to prove that he was not mentally retarded. In addition, defendants arguments concerning jurors and jury instructions were based upon pure, unsubstantiated speculation. Finally if a pre-trial mental retardation hearing was held pursuant to &sect; 400.27(12)(e), the court could not thereafter conduct a post-conviction hearing pursuant to &sect; 400.27-12(a) revisiting the issues decided therein.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner physician anonymously sought a judgment to determine that respondent disciplinary body's determination to publish certain charges issued in connection with his disciplinary proceeding was violative of lawful procedure, arbitrary and capricious, and an abuse of discretion, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7803, and thus it should be ordered to withdraw publication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding, the physician argued that professional disciplinary proceedings were confidential and that publication of charges against him, including the charges that were not sustained, was a violation of the confidentiality laws, and impermissibly subjected his professional reputation to irreparable harm. Alternatively, he requested that if the court should agree with the disciplinary body, then it should convert the proceeding into one for declaratory relief and proceed to declare the subject statute unconstitutional. The court held that confidential medical disciplinary proceedings had been a long-standing policy until that tradition was reversed by the New York Department of Health. Additionally, the physician's argument lacked persuasiveness because it ignored the provisions of N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2995-a(1)(b), (2), which required the Department to maintain physician profiles. The intent was to grant public access to a physician's profile and any disciplinary charges and determinations critical to the public's making of informed decisions in their choice of physicians.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Respondent Department of Health did not act unlawfully in publishing on its official Internet Web site the five factual specifications of professional misconduct filed against petitioner physician after the conclusion of the disciplinary proceeding in which four of the charges were dismissed, and a technical record-keeping violation was found with respect to the remaining charge.  Public Health Law &sect; 230 (10) (g) authorizes public dissemination of the statement of charges and determination and order once the disciplinary proceedings are finally determined.  Moreover, respondent has the discretionary authority to publish and disseminate information concerning physicians licensed to practice within the state as part of its statutory duty to maintain &quot;physician profiles&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Public Health Law &sect; 2995-a).  There is no indication that the Legislature intended to define for respondent the content and scope of the information to be included in the &quot;physician profiles.&quot; Respondent's interpretation of the statutory scheme is consistent with a general governmental policy of preserving the confidentiality of information pertaining to disciplinary proceedings until a determination has been reached.  Furthermore, respondent applied the statutory scheme in a constitutional manner.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought an order: (1) declaring N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 400.27(12)&nbsp;unconstitutional (a) on its face, (b) as applied to him, as he was mentally retarded, and (2) striking the death notice against the defendant because he could not be sentenced to death pursuant to an unconstitutional statute, and (3) granting such other and further relief as just and proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The key question which arose herein was whether case precedent in a United States Supreme Court decision required a determination that portions of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 400.27 were unconstitutional, because the statute cited mental retardation as a mitigating factor to be considered by a jury during the sentencing phase, rather than requiring that a finding of mental retardation by a jury must preclude direction by the jury of a sentence of death. The instant court held that it did. The next question which arose was: could a portion of the statute be stricken as unconstitutional, leaving the balance intact to operate as intended by the legislature, when construed within the confines of that case precedent. The instant court held that it could. The court thus found that portion of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 400.27-9(b) was unconstitutional. To remedy the situation, a simple addition to the jury charge during the sentencing proceeding was recommended, such that: if the jury found that defendant was mentally retarded, then it could not impose a death sentence. This charge would be given in conjunction with all other relevant instructions required to be given to the jury at that time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The motion was granted to the extent that it prohibited a jury from finding mental retardation based on the evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A motion to dismiss the petition because it was unverified was denied as such defects were ignored unless objected to with due diligence, and the alleged defect was not raised until several weeks after the petition was served.

Code &sect; 495-(e), and repossessors were not included in any of the enumerated exemptions. The New York City Administrative Code failed to distinguish tow trucks which recovered vehicles from the scene of accidents from those engaged in repossession operations. The allegations concerning the need for stealth in repossession operations and the insignificant public safety risks attendant therewith were irrelevant. The company was engaged in unlawful towing and was not exempt from the licensing requirements. The licensing process was not onerous.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">New York's Chief Administrative Judge had established an Integrated Domestic Violence (IDV) Part within the supreme court in certain counties, to enable courts to better deal with family-related issues. Defendant argued that the misdemeanor charges against him should not have been transferred to the IDV Part, because N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;&sect; 10.20, 10.30, and 210.05, read together, precluded such a transfer since he had not been charged by indictment. The court held that if it read the statutory provisions to preclude transfer to the IDV Part, it would have to find that they effectively violated the broad jurisdiction granted to the court in various provisions of N.Y. Const. art. VI. Rather than find the criminal procedure laws unconstitutional, it held that the limitations on transfer did not apply where IDV Parts had been established, and that it therefore had jurisdiction over all the domestic actions involving defendant, even the misdemeanor charges not commenced by indictment.</SPAN></P>

An IDV Part is a response to the need for a single court to adjudicate all matters which might bring a family into the court system when the underlying issue is domestic violence. IDV Parts, with the authority to transfer cases pending in a local criminal court to themselves, have been created in accordance with the lawful exercise of the authority duly delegated by the State Constitution to the Chief Administrative Judge to manage the court system.  </SPAN></P>

Justice and reason dictated that any party be allowed to produce new scientific knowledge acquired since 1989. Pending a hearing, the best interests of the child were served limiting his exposure to ETS. The child's mother was to be smoke-free around the child.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence - Judicial Notice - Health Risks Associated with Exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a visitation dispute involving the exposure of the parties' 14-year-old son to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) during court-ordered visitations with plaintiff mother, the court will take judicial notice of specific health risks associated with ETS as recognized by the enactment of Public Health Law article 13-E in 1989.  That statute, in regulating exposure to secondhand smoke in public places, declares ETS to be a public health risk based upon scientific studies showing that breathing secondhand smoke poses a significant health hazard for nonsmokers. However, since the judicially noticed legislative facts are based upon the state of medical literature as of 1989, plaintiff may contest the judicially noticed facts by producing any new scientific knowledge on ETS.  Plaintiff will have the burden of proof to refute the legislative findings.  Furthermore, the court cannot utilize judicial notice to render a final decision mandating an absolutely smoke-free environment in plaintiff's home.  It cannot currently be scientifically determined when a room or home that is the site of smoking ceases to be a risk once smoking has stopped.  Accordingly, since the best interests of the child are served by limiting his exposure to ETS, pending a hearing, defendant father will maintain a smoke-free house, and plaintiff will not smoke in her home 24 hours prior to scheduled visitations. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff law firm sued defendants, facsimile originator and the company which hired it to send facsimiles, under 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 227 of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, for sending the firm an unsolicited facsimile. The firm moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The firm sought statutory and treble damages. The facsimile was commercial speech, and, as it concerned a lawful activity and was not misleading, was protected under U.S. Const. amend. I. The government interests advanced regarding 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 227 of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act's (TCPA) prohibition on unsolicited faxes were to prevent tying up fax lines and shifting advertising costs from advertisers to recipients. Given the current low cost and minimal time involved to receive a fax, banning junk faxes advertising property, goods, or services, but permitting faxes with other content, did not clearly advance the government's alleged interests. It was not practical or possible to know if a fax sent to a large workplace was unsolicited, so the TCPA did not advance the government interests asserted and was more extensive than necessary to serve that interest. A &quot;no-call list&quot; for fax numbers would have been a less intrusive way of achieving the government's objectives.  N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 396-aa provided a less restrictive means of controlling unsolicited faxes, and was sufficient protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The firm's summary judgment motion was denied, and the complaint was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Freedom of Speech - Constitutionality of Federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 with Regard to Unsolicited Telefacsimile Advertising </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Plaintiff law firm fails to state a claim under the Federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA) (47 USC &sect; 227) based upon the receipt from defendant of a single unsolicited facsimile transmission of an advertisement. The TCPA proscribes the use of any &quot;telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other device to send an unsolicited advertisement to a telephone facsimile machine&quot; (47 USC &sect; 227 [b] [1] [C]).  However, fax advertisements qualify as constitutionally protected commercial speech as long as they concern lawful activity and are not misleading. Consequently, the TCPA as applied to faxes is unconstitutional.  The statute is also more restrictive than is necessary to serve the governmental interest asserted.  The establishment of a &quot;no-fax&quot; database would be less intrusive on First Amendment rights.  Furthermore, the less restrictive New York statute concerning unsolicited faxes (General Business Law &sect; 396-aa) is sufficient to protect businesses from unsolicited advertising faxes. </SPAN></P>

No cause of action could be stated against the State under either 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 or 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1981, and the court had no authority to imply a monetary cause of action against the State based on federal constitutional violations, absent congressional or state legislative approval. While an implied cause of action could, generally, be asserted against the State for violation of the equal protection and search and seizure clauses of N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 11, 12, such a cause of action was unavailable when adequate common law causes of action for false arrest, false imprisonment, assault and battery, intentional and negligent injury to property, and negligent infliction of emotional distress could have been stated. No common law causes of action were asserted, and, if they had been, they would have been foreclosed by the limitations provisions of Ct. Cl.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State - Claim against State - Federal and State Constitutional Claims - Availability of Common-Law Tort Remedy </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Court of Claims lacks subject matter jurisdiction over claimant's federal constitutional claims arising from an alleged illegal search and seizure of his person and automobile by state troopers. Absent congressional or state legislative approval, the Court of Claims cannot recognize a monetary cause of action against the State for deprivation of federal constitutional rights.  Similarly, a state constitutional tort claim is not available to claimant, because claimant had an adequate common-law tort remedy but chose not to assert any common-law causes of action in the claim. The alleged wrongs could have been redressed by timely interposed monetary common-law tort claims.  Recognition of an implied constitutional tort claim is therefore not necessary to ensure the full realization of claimant's rights under the State Constitution.  Moreover, since the claim was filed three years after its accrual, any common-law claims would have been time-barred in any event (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Court of Claims Act &sect; 10 [3], [3-b]).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff Crime Victims Board sought an injunction under N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 632-a(6) restraining defendant prison inmate from disbursing, encumbering, or assigning funds in the inmate's account (other than sums constituting child support, earned income, or that were exempt from enforcement or execution), until the inmate's victims' tort claims against him were finally determined. The inmate sought a declaration that &sect; 632-a was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate had been convicted of murdering one police officer and attempting to murder another. Learning that $ 15,062 was about to be paid into the inmate's prison account, the Board sought an injunction or attachment against the account to prevent the inmate from spending or transferring funds. The inmate argued that &sect; 632-a (the &quot;Son of Sam law&quot;) violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the U.S. Constitution and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the New York and U.S. Constitutions. The court disagreed. As &sect; 632-a did not even create a civil remedy, much less a criminal punishment, there was no Ex Post Facto Clause violation. Since the inmate had both notice and the opportunity to be heard before injunctive relief was granted, there was no procedural due process violation. As the Board and the inmate had the same rights to apply for provisional remedies, there was no Equal Protection violation. The court found the victims and citizens of New York would be irreparably damaged if the inmate was allowed to spend the funds in his account before a court could determine whether he was required to pay that money over to his victims. No equities flowed in the inmate's favor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injunction was granted, and the court entered a judgement declaring that the provision for injunctive relief in the &quot;Son of Sam&quot; law did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the federal Constitution or the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the New York and federal Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Crime Victims Board - Provisional Remedies </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Executive Law &sect; 632-a (6), which authorizes the State Crime Victims Board to utilize provisional remedies, violates neither the Ex Post Facto, Due Process or Equal Protection Clause.  There is no ex post facto violation in legislation authorizing a governmental entity to seek already existing civil remedies, since the Ex Post Facto Clause pertains only to criminal punishments.  There is no procedural due process violation, since defendant has had ample notice and opportunity to oppose the board's application for provisional remedies. There is no substantive due process violation, since there is a reasonable connection between permitting the board to obtain provisional remedies and the state's compelling interest in ensuring that the victims of crime are compensated by those who harm them.  Moreover, inasmuch as provisional remedies are equally available to the board and defendant, there is no equal protection violation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Injunctions - When Injunctive Relief Appropriate - Restraint of Prisoner's Funds </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. An injunction restraining the Department of Correctional Services from disbursing, distributing, encumbering or assigning any and all funds credited to the inmate account of defendant, except those sums which constitute child support and earned income, is granted where the victims of defendant's crimes have civil actions pending against him.  Injunctive relief to preserve the assets of a potential judgment debtor is available if the action is directed to a specific fund which can be regarded as the &quot;subject of the action.&quot; A criminal's bank account that is subject to the &quot;Son of Sam&quot; Law (Executive Law &sect; 632-a) is considered to be different from the general assets of the ordinary defendant in a civil case. Accordingly, the victims of defendant's crimes and the citizens of this state will be irreparably damaged if the defendant is allowed to spend the funds in his inmate account before a court can determine whether he is required to pay that money over to his victims. Moreover, there are no equities flowing in favor of the defendant.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Federal law prohibits defendant, a domestic violence probationer who is still subject to an order of protection, from being granted a limited certificate of relief from disabilities (CRD) (Correction Law &sect; 702) in order to permit him to apply for a hunting license and to use a hunting rifle during designated hunting seasons.  Even though a hunting rifle is not a &quot;firearm&quot; that a felon or person subject to an order of protection is automatically prohibited from possessing under New York law (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 530.14; Penal Law &sect; 265.00 [3]; &sect; 400.00 [1]), a hunting rifle is a &quot;firearm&quot; under federal law (18 USC &sect; 921 [a] [3]).  Defendant, as a convicted felon, is prohibited by federal law from possessing such a weapon that traveled in interstate commerce (18 USC &sect; 922 [g] [1]).  Moreover, since the CRD cannot relieve defendant of all firearm restraints, the CRD is legally insufficient to qualify for the exemption to the felon-in-possession of a weapon prohibition where the felon has had all core &quot;civil rights&quot; restored, including the right to possess all types of firearms (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;18 USC &sect; 921 [a] [20]).  Furthermore, a defendant who has been convicted of a domestic violence offense or who is subject to an order of protection is ineligible for a CRD that would restore the right to possess any type of weapon (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;18 USC &sect; 922 [g] [8]).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a police labor union, its president, and other officers, filed a motion for summary judgment against defendants, the state comptroller and others, in their declaratory judgment action which sought to hold 1999 N.Y. Laws ch. 411 invalid and to have payments made into the pension accumulation fund as required by N.Y. Retire. &amp; Soc. Sec. Law &sect;&sect; 23(b)(3)(b) and 323(b)(3)(b). Defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The union's members were participants in either of two state retirement funds. The comptroller had managed the funds' investments so well that the employers' normal contribution rate had decreased to zero. Pursuant to 1999 N.Y. Laws ch. 411, payment of the administrative expenses or costs was made from the fund at that point. Plaintiffs' contention that ch. 411 violated N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 7 failed because there was no impairment of the comptroller's fiduciary discretion over the funds, nor were investment earnings diverted at the expense of the funds' members. The court held that 1999 N.Y. Laws ch. 411 was a proper exercise of the legislature's authority, noting that the comptroller never had any significant discretion with respect to funding of administrative expenses previously. The court held that ch. 411 fell within the limits of the legislature's reserved authority. The comptroller was relieved of his statutory obligation to collect employers' reimbursements of administration costs in certain circumstances, but this did not diminish or impair the benefit of his independent judgment. Accordingly, the court concluded that ch. 411 did not represent a radical change.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and granted defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Retirement and Pension Benefits - Employers' Contributions - Impairment of Constitutionally Protected Pension Benefits </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chapter 411 of the Laws of 1999 does not unlawfully infringe upon constitutionally protected pension benefits of public employees (NY Const, art V, &sect; 7).  Chapter 411 relieves local public employers of their statutory obligation to make annual administration contributions into the Common Retirement Fund (CRF) to reimburse the CRF for administrative expenses (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 23 [b] [3] [b]; &sect; 323 [b] [3] [b]) if the State Comptroller determines that CRF assets and investment earnings in any given year are sufficient to fully fund basic retirement benefits without the &quot;normal contribution&quot; employers are required to make for that year.  The statute relieves the Comptroller of the statutory obligation to collect employers' reimbursements of administration costs in certain circumstances, but does not interfere with the Comptroller's independent judgment or create an inappropriate level of risk in the management of the CRF.  Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the use of investment earnings to pay administration contributions when such funds are available poses any risk to the security of employees' retirement benefits. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff administrator filed an action against defendant inmate, pursuant to N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 632-a(3), seeking funds which the inmate received after he settled an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The inmate filed a motion to dismiss the administrator's action, arguing, inter alia, that N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 632-a(3) was unconstitutional. The New York State Office of the Attorney General requested that it be allowed to intervene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An inmate was incarcerated after he was convicted of committing second-degree murder in 1988. While he was incarcerated, the inmate filed an action, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, against employees of the New York State Department of Correctional Services, and he settled that action for $ 25,000 in May 2001. The person who was appointed to administer the murder victim's estate learned about the settlement and filed an action in October 2001, pursuant to N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 632-a(3), seeking the money the inmate received. The trial court held that &sect; 632-a(3) did not deny the inmate access to the courts, did not violate the inmate's right to equal protection of the law and substantive due process of law, and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court denied the inmate's motion to dismiss the administrator's complaint and granted the administrator's request that the $ 25,000 being held in the inmate's account by the warden of the facility where the inmate was incarcerated be paid into the court until the New York State Crime Victims Board could take action within its mandate to protect the money.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Son of Sam Law </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Son of Sam Law, which allows the victim of a &quot;specified crime&quot; or the victim's estate, to bring an action to recover money damages from the person convicted of committing the crime within three years of the discovery of funds of the convicted person (Executive Law &sect; 632-a [3]), is not unconstitutional as applied to the settlement proceeds of a federal civil rights action received in 2001 by defendant, a prison inmate incarcerated for having murdered plaintiffs' mother in 1988.  The statute does not violate defendant's fundamental constitutional right to access to the courts.  The statute does not prohibit defendant from pursuing legal relief against any alleged wrong that is committed against him in the future.  Furthermore, the statute does not violate defendant's constitutional right to equal protection. The extension of time provided for in the statute, that allows crime victims to bring an action within three years of discovering any funds of a convicted person, is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest in compensating victims of crime from the assets of the person who caused the harm.  Lastly, the statute does not violate defendant's right to substantive due process.  There is nothing arbitrary, conscience-shocking or oppressive in permitting crime victims to seek compensation from those who have caused them injury once they discover that the person who harmed them has acquired assets.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner entered a plea of not responsible by reason of mental disease or defect to the crimes of attempted assault and criminal possession of a weapon and was adjudicated in the County Court (New York) to be suffering from a dangerous mental disorder. In accordance with N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 330.20(16), petitioner requested a rehearing and review of that recommitment order via a jury trial in accordance with N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 9.35.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner claimed that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 330.20(14) was unconstitutional because he had been committed both criminally and civilly in state psychiatric facilities for a period longer than he could have been incarcerated if he had been convicted of his charged crimes. The reviewing court held that the application to have &sect; 330.20(14) declared unconstitutional was denied. Petitioner's hypothetical maximum sentence did not provide the constitutional limit for his commitment. Further, the jury instruction sequence advocated by petitioner was the more logical, the more intelligible to the jury, and fairer to petitioner. The jury should have had the opportunity to determine the issue of mental illness and the need for retention before it determined the issue of dangerous mental disorder. Also, the trial court in its discretion could use the jury in an advisory capacity on the issue of dangerousness, as it did, but it did not indicate that to the jury. Therefore, the jury should have been instructed that the sequence of its findings should be mental illness, need for retention, and dangerous mental disorder.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. CPL 330.20 (14) is not unconstitutional because it permits a defendant found not responsible by reason of mental disease or defect to be confined for a period longer than he could have been incarcerated if he had been convicted of the crimes charged. An insanity acquitee's hypothetical maximum sentence does not set the constitutional limit for his commitment.  Moreover, an insanity acquitee, having been found not to be suffering from a dangerous mental disorder, could constitutionally later be found to have such a mental condition and, thereupon, criminally recommitted, since the criminal court retains supervisory authority over insanity acquitees. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mental Health - Person Acquitted of Crime by Reason of Insanity - Jury Findings </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a proceeding to determine if an insanity acquitee's confinement should be continued, a jury should be instructed that it is to make two findings: mental illness, and the need for retention. Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 9.35, which is incorporated by reference in CPL 330.20 (16), provides, in part, that &quot;if the verdict of the jury ... be that such person is mentally ill and in need of retention the justice shall ... make an order authorizing continued retention.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mental Health - Person Acquitted of Crime by Reason of Insanity - Sequence of Jury Findings </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In a proceeding to determine if an insanity acquitee's confinement should be continued, a jury should first determine if the acquitee has a mental illness. If the jury determines that the acquitee suffers from a mental illness, it should then determine if he is in need of retention, or if he is mentally ill but not in need of retention. If the acquitee is determined to be both mentally ill and in need of retention, the jury should finally determine if he suffers from a dangerous mental disorder. It is more logical for a jury to have the opportunity to determine the issue of mental illness and the need for retention before determining the issue of dangerous mental disorder. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In a proceeding to determine the need for continued confinement of an insanity acquitee, the jury should be instructed that the act which resulted in the acquitee's plea of not responsible by reason of mental disease or defect established beyond a reasonable doubt that the acquitee committed the crimes charged. However, such an instruction does not preclude the acquitee from testifying that his involvement in the crime resulting in the plea was different from the allegations against him, and that despite the plea he did not suffer from a mental illness. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff beer wholesaler, suing defendant brewer for breach of contract and termination of its distributorship in violation of N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 55-c, moved to dismiss and strike the brewer's first affirmative defense, in which it challenged the constitutionality of the statute claimed to have been violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wholesaler's distribution contract with the brewer's predecessor explicitly acknowledged that N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 55-c governed the agreement. The predecessor sold the rights to certain labels to the brewer, which announced that it was terminating the wholesaler's contract to allow its own pre-existing distributors to take over the territory. In the meantime, &sect; 55-c had been amended to narrowly circumscribe the circumstances and manner in which beer distributorships could be terminated, and the amendment also indicated that it was to have retrospective application. The court held that such retrospective application to the agreement the brewer inherited from the predecessor did not violate the Contracts Clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The amendments were primarily a clarification of pre-existing law in an area of heavy governmental regulation, and there was no reason to suppose that such changes were not within the reasonable expectations of the contracting parties.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Contract Clause - Retroactive Application of New Termination Procedures for Beer Distributorships </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The retroactive application of recently enacted amendments to Alcoholic Beverage Control Law &sect; 55-c (L 2001, ch 346, eff June 15, 2001) with regard to the new termination procedures for beer distributorships is not violative of the constitutional prohibition against impairing the obligations of contracts (US Const, art I, &sect; 10 [1]) as applied to defendant's attempt to terminate plaintiff's beer distributorship before the legislation was signed into law on September 19, 2001.  The amendments prohibit termination of a beer wholesaler's distributorship agreement except under very circumscribed occurrences.  Defendant's August 31, 2001 termination letter fails to satisfy the new amendments as to the requisite notice, a reasonably detailed written national &quot;consolidation policy,&quot; and the compensation required for the loss of distributorship rights.  The remedial amendments did not impair any contract-based expectations. Defendant contracted in a &quot;heavily regulated&quot; area, and could not justifiably rely on the continuity of the statutory scheme where the parties' agreement expressly provides that their contractual rights were subject to alteration by state law with respect to &quot;longer or otherwise differing termination notice periods, procedures, or justifications.&quot; Retroactive application of the statute would therefore not substantially alter the vested contract rights of the parties or impose unanticipated consequences.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the city marshal executed an order of eviction, he found the owner's two male Rottweiler puppies and turned them over to the animal shelter. When owner attempted to regain possession of his two dogs, he was informed that his dogs could not be released to him unless they were first neutered. The owner argued that the requirement to have his dogs neutered as a precondition of getting them returned to him violated his right to equal protection, where it created an unconstitutional distinction between his pedigreed dogs and registered show breed dogs. The shelter opposed the owner's motion, arguing that the provision met constitutional muster. The trial court found that the requirement to establish a genuine public need for the challenged ordinance did not lie with New York City, but rather it was whether the dog owner demonstrated that there was no rational connection between the regulation and the promotion of safety of persons and property. The trial court found that the owner could not meet the rational review standard, and the petition was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient was most recently admitted to the hospital, pursuant to N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 9.27. The patient sought to be released, and the hospital sought an order authorizing an involuntary admission for a period of 60 days. At the hearing, the Attorney General for the State of New York, appeared on behalf of the hospital, and offered, and the trial court took judicial notice of, an order of a previous court authorizing the emergency admission of the patient to continue for a 15-day period. However, the trial court found that such order, under N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 9.39, was based upon a lesser standard, of &quot;reasonable cause&quot; to believe that the patient was mentally ill, and in need of retention. That standard was insufficient to support a determination that the patient was in need of continued retention for a period of 60 days, following his involuntary admission. The appropriate standard to guarantee due process rights of the patient was that the hospital was required to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the patient was in need of hospitalization, a standard the hospital did not meet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a patient-initiated retention hearing conducted pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 9.31 following an involuntary psychiatric admission under Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 9.27, the hospital has the burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that the patient is dangerous and in need of continued retention for a 60-day period.  Placing the burden on the patient on the issue of dangerousness would contravene minimum due process standards and would thus subject the statutory scheme to constitutional infirmity. The statutory requirement that the patient initiate the request for a hearing is merely a procedural device for invoking the patient's statutory and constitutional right for a judicial determination of the patient's continued, involuntary confinement. Accordingly, since petitioner hospital failed to produce sufficient evidence to sustain its burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence following the patient's emergency involuntary admission, the patient is ordered released from confinement. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On August 11, 2001, defendant was arraigned. At arraignment, the People served and filed a supporting deposition as well as a field test. Defendant was released on his own recognizance, and the case was adjourned to October 1, 2001 for discovery by stipulation. Although the People alleged that they answered ready for trial at arraignment, the minutes of defendant's arraignment contained no such statement of readiness. On September 11, 2001, the governor issued an executive order in which he declared a disaster emergency in the state. On October 29, 2001, the People answered not ready for trial due to the policy restricting notification of officers to testify at trial in misdemeanors involving non-incarcerated defendants. On February 28, 2002, the People answered ready for trial. On March 18, 2002, defense counsel filed a motion to dismiss. The trial court found that the governor did not usurp the functions of the legislature in issuing the executive orders. The attack on the World Trade Center was the single largest attack upon the mainland United States in its entire history. Thereafter, the courts were closed anywhere from several days to a week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Separation of Powers - Suspension of Laws by Governor during State Disaster Emergency - Executive Orders Suspending Operation of CPL 30.30 Following Attack on World Trade Center </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Executive Orders issued by the Governor suspending certain speedy trial provisions of CPL 30.30 in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;9 NYCRR 5.113 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) are not unconstitutional as violative of the principle of separation of powers.  The Executive Orders were authorized by Executive Law &sect; 29-a, which provides that the Governor may &quot;temporarily suspend specific provisions of any statute ... during a state disaster emergency, if compliance with such provisions would prevent, hinder, or delay action necessary to cope with the disaster.&quot; In addition to suspending the general operation of CPL 30.30 until January 7, 2002, the Governor specifically suspended CPL 30.30 (4) (g) &quot;so far as it may be interpreted to limit 'exceptional circumstances' in a way that would not include any delay attributable to the disaster emergency&quot; ( 9 NYCRR 5.113.28).  The attack on the World Trade Center clearly fits within the definition of an &quot;exceptional circumstance.&quot; In view of the fact that the purpose of CPL 30.30 is to serve the narrow purpose of prosecutorial readiness, and given the severe restrictions upon the People's ability to be ready for trial in the weeks immediately following September 11, the Governor's Executive Orders were consistent with the intent of the Legislature and are therefore constitutional.  Accordingly, since the People can be charged with only 78 days of delay in defendant's misdemeanor drug possession prosecution, which commenced with his arraignment on August 11, 2001, defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint on speedy trial grounds is denied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an action seeking a judgment declaring that 55 line-item vetoes by defendant Governor of the State of New York (governor) interposed in 1998 in bills that did not appropriate monies violated N.Y. Const. art. IV &sect; 7, plaintiff Speaker of the New York State Assembly (speaker) moved the court to determine his prior application for summary judgment, and the governor's cross-motion for summary judgment dismissing the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The speaker challenged the constitutionality of the governor's line item vetoes. The governor moved to dismiss for lack of standing, and the interim court, on appeal, agreed. However, the appellate court overturned the decision, and remanded the matter back to the trial court. The speaker then sought a ruling on his previous motion for summary judgment which had not been ruled on by the trial court, and the governor cross moved for summary judgment. The trial court found that while it was clear that the case was moot in that any veto found to have been unconstitutionally interposed could not have resulted in the appropriation being revived and implemented in the manner directed by the legislature, courts had recognized exceptions to the mootness doctrine. None of the material vetoed constituted substantive provisions that would become part of the consolidated laws of the state. However, by inserting provisions that affected appropriations in bills that did not appropriate money, but which referred to bills that did appropriate money, the legislature impermissibly attempted to do indirectly that which could not have been done directly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - Academic and Moot Questions - Exception to Mootness Doctrine - Power of Legislature to Alter Governor's Budget Bills </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. An action by the Speaker of the New York State Assembly seeking a judgment declaring that certain line-item vetoes by the Governor interposed in 1998 violated section 7 of article IV of the State Constitution should not be dismissed on grounds of mootness, even though any veto found to have been unconstitutionally interposed cannot result in the appropriation being revived and implemented in the manner directed by the Legislature.  This action qualifies for an exception to the mootness doctrine.  The only aspect of the requested relief remaining is a declaration relating to the respective powers of the parties in the budgetary process.  The issues raised are novel, of significant public importance, and may not be capable of review other than through litigation.  A final determination of these issues will likely enable the parties to ascertain their respective powers in the budgetary process, and thus avoid future litigation which is probable absent a decision on the merits.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State - Budget - Power of Legislature to Alter Governor's Budget Bills </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Legislative directions, segregations and limitations set forth in separate nonappropriation bills with respect to the spending of appropriated monies unconstitutionally altered the budget bills submitted by the Governor. Under the State Constitution, the &quot;legislature may not alter an appropriation bill submitted by the governor except to strike out or reduce items therein, but it may add thereto items of appropriation provided that such additions are stated separately and distinctly from the original items of the bill and refer each to a single object or purpose&quot; (NY Const, art VII, &sect; 4). Budget bills submitted by the Governor may consist both of measures that appropriate money as well as programmatic bills amending substantive law to implement the appropriations. However, the contents of an appropriation bill are limited to provisions that relate &quot;specifically to some particular appropriation in the bill&quot; (NY Const, art VII, &sect; 6).  Such provisions may set forth the &quot;when, how or where&quot; the monies appropriated therein may be spent. Thus, being part of an item of appropriation, these provisions are subject to the &quot;no alteration&quot; restriction of section 4 of article VII.  The Legislature may not constitutionally place alterations of the Governor's appropriation related legislation stating &quot;when, how or where&quot; monies may be expended in nonappropriation programmatic bills.  By inserting these provisions that affect appropriations in bills that do not appropriate money, but which refer to bills that do appropriate money, the Legislature impermissibly attempted to do indirectly that which could not be done directly.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, charged with first degree murder and lesser crimes, regarding which the State sought the death penalty, moved to dismiss the indictments and for the disclosure of information regarding the selection of grand juries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant said Hispanics, &quot;poor people,&quot; and &quot;young people&quot; were underrepresented in the grand jury selection process. He sought jury-selection information to prove his claim. Neither &quot;poor people&quot; nor &quot;young people&quot; were distinctive groups as contemplated by the requirement to select grand juries from a fair cross-section of the community. The sources from which jury lists were composed were not unreasonably stale or, if they were, such staleness did not cause an underrepresentation of Hispanics. Underrepresentation of Hispanics in those sources, including lists of voters, licensed drivers, taxpayers, and unemployment compensation, resulting from voluntary behavior patterns, unencouraged by state action, did not show their systematic exclusion. A lack of monitoring of jury lists did not show a systematic exclusion of any group. The methods by which grand juries were selected did not violate defendant's right to equal protection or his due process right to a grand jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community, nor did he show that additional disclosure of jury-selection material was necessary to determine his claims.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grand Jury - Selection of Jury - Fair Cross-Section of Community </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defendant has failed to demonstrate that the indictments in his death penalty case (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 250.40) should be dismissed due to the underrepresentation in the Queens County grand jury pool of &quot;poor people,&quot; Hispanics and young persons aged 18 to 34.  Underrepresentation in the grand jury pool alone does not establish a constitutional violation.  To make a prima facie showing requiring the People to respond, there must be a showing that the underrepresentation actually resulted from the selection procedures employed.  A fair cross-section claim requires a showing that something inherent in the selection process resulted in the systematic exclusion of the underrepresented group.  Defendant has failed to show that the method by which the grand juries were selected violated either his right to equal protection or his due process right to a grand jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community.  No showing has been made of any discriminatory intent, either presumed or actual, at any stage of the jury selection process. Any underrepresentation of Hispanics on the jury source lists is not attributable to the jury selection system, and does not establish a fair cross-section violation.  Furthermore, defendant failed to demonstrate that additional disclosure of jury selection material is necessary to determine his claims.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an action stemming from defendant State's failure to increase the current compensation rates for assigned counsel, plaintiff county bar association moved for a preliminary injunction and declaratory judgment mandating a higher minimum hourly rate for court-assigned counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bar association sought declarations, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 3001 that: (1) the State was obligated to ensure that a sufficient number of qualified private attorneys were available and able to represent children and indigent adults in family and criminal proceedings in New York City; (2) the State's failure to raise the hourly rates of compensation paid to assigned counsel, the distinction between the rates paid for in and out-of-court work, and the ceilings on total per case compensation created a severe and unacceptably high risk that children and indigent adults would not receive meaningful and effective legal representation; and (3) the rate-setting was unconstitutional as currently applied to the representation of children and indigent adults. Specifically, the bar contended that the failure to increase the current compensation rates for assigned counsel rendered hollow the right to counsel. The trial court found that the bar association satisfied its burden of showing a likelihood that indigent litigants in the New York City family and criminal courts were being denied effective assistance of counsel as a result of the current compensation rates.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court issued a mandatory preliminary injunction directing payment of an interim rate of $ 90 an hour for in and out-of-court work, but declined to issue a declaratory judgment without a full trial on the merits.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In view of the documented imminent danger of ineffective assistance of counsel to indigent litigants in New York City Family and Criminal Courts resulting from the inadequate statutory compensation rates paid to assigned counsel (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;County Law &sect; 722-b; Family Ct Act &sect; 245 [b]; Judiciary Law &sect; 35 [2]), plaintiff bar association is granted a mandatory preliminary injunction directing payment of an interim rate of $ 90 for in- and out-of-court work.  The $ 90 hourly fee is consistent with the rates paid for assigned counsel work in the federal courts.  Plaintiff has satisfied its heightened burden of showing extraordinary circumstances to warrant preliminary injunctive relief. Plaintiff's uncontroverted documentary evidence demonstrates the adverse effects and the depth of the crisis of the current compensation rates on juvenile delinquency cases, abuse and neglect proceedings, appeal backlogs, arraignment overload, individual assigned counsel case overload, uncertified panel counsel, and prolonged delays.  The doctrine of separation of powers must yield on a showing that the State's failure to raise the current compensation rates adversely affects the judiciary's ability to function and presumptively subjects innocent indigent citizens to increased risks of adverse adjudications and convictions merely because of their poverty.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A woman told police she saw two men pickpocketing on a bus. An officer produced a computer printout with the photos of suspects, and the woman identified defendant as one of the men. Later, the officer saw defendant bump into a person on a bus, and arrested him. The first woman picked him out of a lineup. At the suppression hearing, the State could not find the original computer printout of the photo array, so a second printout was generated. This, claimed defendant, was a Rosario violation. The court disagreed. Under the New York Electronic Signatures and Records Act (ESRA), N.Y. State Tech. Law &sect;&sect; 101-109 (McKinney's art. 57-A), the court was obliged to consider the second printout as proof of the original computer record due to the manner in which the document was stored and retrieved. The court determined that ERSA applied to criminal as well as civil cases, as defendant's constitutional rights were not violated by its application. The court did not need to decide whether ERSA was preempted by a federal statute, since the result would have been the same under either. The officer had probable cause to arrest defendant, and the lineup was properly conducted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The failure of the People to produce the &quot;original&quot; computer-generated photo array from which defendant was identified does not constitute a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Rosario</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> violation or create a presumption that the photo identification was impermissibly suggestive. The People have demonstrated that the electronic record was appropriately retrieved and reproduced on paper, resulting in a second printout that is identical to the &quot;original&quot; printout. Under these circumstances, the second printout is admissible under New York's Electronic Signatures and Records Act (State Technology Law art I [ESRA]).  ESRA governs the use and legal admissibility of records stored by electronic means in both civil and criminal proceedings.  The statute permits the court to consider the second printout as proof of the &quot;original&quot; computer record due to the manner in which the document was stored and retrieved (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;State Technology Law &sect; 105; 9 NYCRR 540.5). Since both printouts were generated in the same format, there can be no prejudice from the fact that the defendant was selected from the first printout and that a second identical printout was later used at hearing or trial.  Each is identical and conveys the full recoverable information. Furthermore, the result with regard to the photo array would be the same even if the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (15 USC &sect; 7001 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) were applicable.  </SPAN></P>

To deny indigent petitioners access to assigned counsel overlooks the situation where the respondent has no funds from which to reimburse the petitioner and the issues presented are complex.  In seeking to establish his paternity, petitioner is seeking to establish parental rights which, once established, are to be protected by assigned counsel. Establishing the entitlement to parental rights should be no less constitutionally protected than defending against their diminution, especially when there are legal challenges to be addressed before blood tests can even be ordered.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff businesses filed an action against defendants, the Board of Trustees of the Village of Westbury (New York), the Village of Westbury (New York) Planning Board, and village officials, seeking an order declaring that village ordinances which regulated the hours businesses could operate were invalid. A business that had applied for permission to operate a convenience store filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A business had an interest in real property that was zoned for business use sought permission to operate a convenience store that would be open 24 hours a day. At the time the application was submitted, the village where the property was located had not passed any ordinance regulating the hours during which businesses could operate. In November 2000, the village board of trustees enacted Village of Westbury, N.Y., Code &sect; 248.251.1, which prohibited businesses located within 100 feet of property zoned for residential use from operating between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. Six months later, the village board of trustees enacted Village of Westbury, N.Y., Code &sect; 128-1 to provide criminal penalties for violating Village of Westbury, N.Y., Code &sect; 248.251.1. The court held that (1) to the extent the ordinances prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages during hours when sale was permitted by the New York State Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, state law preempted them; (2) Village of Westbury, N.Y., Code &sect; 248.251.1 was an invalid exercise of zoning power; and (3) Village of Westbury, N.Y., Code &sect; 128-1 was an unreasonable regulatory interference with private business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court treated the business's motion for a preliminary injunction as a motion for summary judgment and for permanent injunctive relief, granted the motion, enjoined the village from enforcing the ordinances, and ordered the village to process the business's site development application.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Zoning - Invalid Restriction on Operation of 24-Hour Businesses </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. A village zoning ordinance that prohibits a business located within 100 feet of residentially zoned property from operating overnight constitutes an invalid exercise of the zoning power.  The zoning ordinance does not bear a sufficient relationship to the physical use of land (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Village Law &sect; 7-700), and thus may not be upheld.  Respondent failed to adequately substantiate its claim with respect to the adverse impact of 24-hour uses on neighboring properties.  Respondent failed to submit any prior complaints from residents living adjacent to 24-hour businesses regarding problems specifically created by overnight operations.  Absent substantial evidence showing the external impact of the land use in question, a restriction on hours of operation constitutes an impermissible attempt to regulate the details of the operation of a business rather than a valid regulation of land use. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Invalid Exercise of Local Police Power to Regulate 24-Hour Business Operations </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. A general village ordinance that prohibits a business located within 100 feet of residentially zoned property from operating overnight constitutes an invalid exercise of the village's police power to regulate business operations.  In order to justify regulatory interference with the conduct of a private business, there must be some &quot;real or substantial evil&quot; that the regulation is designed to cure, and a reasonable relation between such menace and the remedy proposed.  Petitioner has shown that the ordinance will interfere with its customary business operations, while respondent has failed to establish the existence of a &quot;substantial evil.&quot; Respondent Village failed to submit any prior complaints from residents living adjacent to 24-hour businesses regarding problems specifically created by overnight operations.  In any event, even if the harm were substantiated by complaints based on actual experience, the ordinance would still be invalid since it is overly broad and does not bear a reasonable relationship to the harm confronted.  The goals asserted by the Village could be promoted through less onerous and more effective means, such as the adoption and/or vigorous enforcement of laws specifically addressed to the levels of light and noise generated in proximity to residential property. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with inciting to riot and disorderly conduct after he and his companions allegedly confronted a crowd with praise for the World Trade Center Bombing, and threatened crowd members. He filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the accusatory instrument was facially insufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complaint alleged that defendant and his companions shouted at a crowd of about 50 people in praise of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and the resulting deaths; vehemently expressed their shared disappointment that the carnage had not been greater; and accosted people in the crowd, yelling in their faces. The court held that the complaint made out the elements of the crime of inciting to riot. He and his accomplices used extremely inflammatory language calculated to cause unrest in the crowd; his conduct could not be considered an expression of a political nature, intended to spur debate, that would be protected by the First Amendment. Further, it was alleged that he threatened crowd members. The elements of disorderly conduct were also made out by the complaint. Defendant's words and deeds as alleged in the complaint demonstrated his intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm, or recklessly create a risk thereof by engaging in tumultuous or threatening behavior.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's words that &quot;it's good that the World Trade Center was bombed,&quot; &quot;more cops and firemen should have died,&quot; &quot;more bombs should have dropped and more people should have been killed,&quot; and his additional conduct in shouting the threat &quot;we've got something for your asses&quot; directly into the faces of onlookers, were plainly intended to incite the crowd to violence, and not simply to express a point of view.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant moved to vacate the instant court's previous removal, to itself from the Hoosick, New York, Town Court, of an action prosecuting her for endangering the welfare of a child. She argued that the removal was beyond the court's powers and deprived her of her right to a jury drawn from a fair cross-section of her community.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The chief judge of New York's high court approved a plan, and delegated its administration to the chief administrator, to integrate courts in Rensselaer County to permit coordinated action in related cases. Under this plan, the instant court removed to itself a criminal action commenced against defendant in the town court. When defendant challenged its action, the court held, first, that it had the power under N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 19 to remove actions, even to itself, except where such removal was explicitly prohibited, and that the integrated plan under which it acted was within the N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 28 powers of the chief judge and the chief administrator. Finally, since the action was properly in the instant court, there was no violation of N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 500's fair cross-section requirement in drawing from the countywide pool that the instant court customarily drew from.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - Transfer to Other Court - Power of Supreme Court to Remove Pending Local Criminal Court Action to Itself </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Supreme Court has the constitutional authority to remove a pending local criminal court action to itself without the need for specific statutory authorization.  NY Constitution, article VI, &sect; 19 (a) authorizes Supreme Court, &quot;as may be provided by law,&quot; to &quot;transfer to itself any action or proceeding originated or pending in another court within the judicial department ... upon a finding that such a transfer will promote the administration of justice.&quot; The phrase &quot;as may be provided by law&quot; does not require implementing legislation before Supreme Court can remove a lower court case to itself.  Rather, the Constitution grants Supreme Court full authority to remove cases to itself, subject to the regulatory power of the Legislature to adopt legislation governing the procedure for doing so.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jury - Right to Jury Trial - Effect of Removal of Pending Local Criminal Court Action to Supreme Court </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Supreme Court's removal of a criminal action pending in a local criminal court to itself as authorized by NY Constitution, article VI, &sect; 19 (a) does not violate defendant's constitutional and statutory rights to be judged by a jury of her peers selected at random from a fair cross-section of the community.  Defendant's right to jury trial does not require that the jury be drawn only from the local community where the charges were filed.  Rather, Judiciary Law &sect; 500 only requires that a jury panel be selected from &quot;the community in the county or other governmental subdivision wherein the court convenes.&quot; A jury panel randomly selected from a county-wide pool represents a fair cross-section of the community in the county wherein the court will &quot;convene&quot; within the meaning of Judiciary Law &sect; 500.  Furthermore, defendant has failed to demonstrate that a jury panel randomly selected from a county-wide pool, rather than from the local community, would result in an unfair trial.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Plaintiff Governor awarded judgment; cross-motions of the defendants denied; implementation of decision, order and judgment stayed pending determination of the next appeal.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff governor commenced an action against defendants, state senate, assembly, and comptroller, seeking a judgment declaring certain budget bills unconstitutional. The comptroller's motion to dismiss was granted. Intervention was denied. The parties moved and cross-moved for summary judgment, and agreed that the issues raised in the instant action presented questions of law, amenable to summary judgment resolution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The two critical issues in the instant action were: (1) what proposals could properly be included by the governor in an appropriation bill; and (2) whether the legislature could strike out what it found to be extraneous, non-appropriation measures from the governor's proposed budget. After discussing the history of the state budgeting process, the court found that the legislature could not alter the governor's appropriation bills, except to strike out or reduce specific terms of appropriation or to add new appropriations, under N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4. This did not mean that ultimate control of public spending would not still reside with the legislature. If the legislature decided that the policy proposals advanced by the governor with respect to how to spend the state's money, as contained in an appropriation bill or bills, were not what the law should be, the remedy was in the legislature's hands. The legislature could simply fail to enact the governor's appropriation bills. The court found that the enactment of the 37 single-purpose bills, in the instant action, was an unconstitutional attempt by the legislature to discard the governor's executive budget and write its own.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The governor was awarded judgment declaring that the action of the state assembly and state senate, in enacting 46 budget bills, was unconstitutional. The cross motions for summary judgment, by the assembly and senate, were denied. Implementation of the decision, order, and judgment of the court was stayed pending the determination of the next court to which an appeal would be taken.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State - Budget - Power of Legislature to Delete Nonappropriation Measures from Governor's Budget </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The New York State Assembly and Senate acted unconstitutionally by passing altered and amended versions of the nine appropriation bills submitted by the Governor in order to correct alleged constitutional deficiencies.  Under the constitutional budgetary scheme, the Governor is solely responsible for formulating state fiscal policy.  The ultimate approval of that policy is left to the Legislature, subject to severe restrictions upon how it can alter the Governor's appropriation and spending plans.  The Governor has the option of submitting the proposed budget and &quot;proposed legislation&quot; to implement the budget to the Legislature in either a single bill or in multiple bills (NY Const, art VII, &sect; 3).  The appropriations and &quot;proposed legislation&quot; need not be set forth in separate bills.  Once the proposed budget is submitted, the Legislature may not alter the Governor's appropriation bills except to strike out or reduce specific items of appropriation or add new appropriations. Consequently, the Legislature lacks the constitutional authority to strike out what it finds to be extraneous, nonappropriation measures.  Furthermore, the Legislature's enactment of 37 single-purpose budget bills was an unconstitutional attempt to discard the Governor's budget and write one of its own.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The indictment charged defendant with murder in the first degree and lesser crimes in connection with a robbery and shooting. In his motion, defendant argued that the multiple killings charged were allegedly the product of such separate and distinct criminal acts committed in the course of a single criminal transaction. Each act was alleged to have been committed with an independent specific intent to cause the death of the individual victim. The trial court found that because the killings resulted from successive and distinguishable impulses, each able to support a separate charge, the conduct alleged in the first 20 counts did not constitute a single continuing offense, and therefore need not to have been charged in a single count. Further, the trial court found that not only was it unnecessary to charge the killings in a single count as defendant proposed, but it would have been unwise.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. An indictment charging defendant with 20 counts of first degree murder, for allegedly causing the death of five individuals as part of the same criminal transaction, is not multiplicitous. Each count named two individuals, one as a principal deceased, i.e., the person intentionally killed and the other a secondary deceased, i.e., the additional person intentionally killed as part of the same criminal transaction. Counts of an indictment are multiplicitous when they separately charge the same crime. The sequential killing of more than two persons, committed as part of the same criminal transaction in violation of Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (viii), does not constitute a single continuing offense over time.  A criminal transaction may involve conduct establishing more than one offense. The definition of first degree murder indicates that the crime will be committed through the commission, as part of the same criminal transaction, of two or more separate and distinct offenses, each constituting an intentional murder. Here, the multiple killings charged were allegedly the product of such separate and distinct criminal acts committed in the course of a single criminal transaction. Each act is alleged to have been committed with an independent specific intent to cause the death of the individual victim.  Because the killing resulted from successive and distinguishable impulses, each able to support a separate charge, the conduct alleged in the first 20 counts does not constitute a single continuing offense, and therefore need not be charged in a single count. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The count of an indictment charging defendant with first degree murder for allegedly causing the death of a person during the commission of a robbery will not be dismissed on the ground that the robbery element of that charge is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Penal Law &sect; 160.00 clearly defines robbery. The statute proscribes intentional killing by a defendant while in the course of committing and in furtherance of robbery (Penal Law &sect; 125.27 [1] [a] [vii]).  The count tracks this language.  Terms defined by statute are not unconstitutionally vague because they are used in a newly enacted provision and have not yet received a definitive definition from the state's highest court.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. The counts of an indictment charging defendant with first degree and second degree felony murder, for allegedly intentionally killing a person while in the course of committing and in furtherance of a robbery, will not be dismissed on the ground that the element &quot;in the course of and in furtherance of&quot; is vague and overbroad. Statutory vagueness involves analyzing whether the statute is sufficiently definite to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that the conduct is forbidden and provides explicit standards for application.  A conviction for felony murder requires a showing that the killing was committed in the attempted execution of the unlawful end and in furtherance of the unlawful purpose. Defendant stands accused of having forcibly stolen money at gunpoint in a restaurant and shooting the employees to ensure no surviving witnesses.  The felony murder statutes, including the elements &quot;in the course of and in furtherance of,&quot; raise no danger of arbitrary or discriminatory application and are sufficiently definite to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that the charged conduct was forbidden.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4.  Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (vii) is not underinclusive to the extent that the statute includes certain felonies and not others as predicates for first degree felony murder. A statute is presumed constitutional and will not be struck down as unconstitutional unless the invalidity is demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt.  Defendant has failed to make the requisite showing.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On preliminary consideration of a citation charging defendant with violating N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1225-C, which prohibited hand-held cell phone use while driving, the court, sua sponte, considered whether the new statute violated the New York or United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Before hearing a case charging defendant with violating N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1225-C, a new law prohibiting use of hand-held cell phone use, the court considered the constitutionality of the statute, on its own motion, bearing in mind the presumption of constitutionality. First, because the law clearly defined the prohibited conduct, and provided for an initial period of non-enforcement, the court held that it was not vague or overbroad. Second, it held that it did not unreasonably infringe privacy rights beyond what was necessary for the state to exercise its police power to protect public safety, because drivers could use headsets or pull off the road during calls. Finally, the numerous exclusions for persons using cell phones in emergency situations did not violate equal protection, because they bore a reasonable relation to the legislative purpose of promoting public safety.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ruled that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Vagueness - Statute Prohibiting Use of Mobile Telephones while Driving </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1.  Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1225-c, which prohibits use of hand-held mobile telephones while operating a motor vehicle, is not unconstitutionally vague. A statute is unconstitutional if it is so vague or overly broad to the point where a reasonable person of ordinary intelligence would be unable to ascertain what conduct is prohibited.  Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1225-c (2) (a) provides that &quot;no person shall operate a motor vehicle upon a public highway using a mobile telephone to engage in a call while such vehicle is in motion.&quot; The statute distinguishes between the prohibited &quot;mobile telephones&quot; and the permitted &quot;hands-free mobile telephone&quot; where the operator can maintain &quot;both hands&quot; on the steering device.  ( Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1225-c [1] [e].) This language is clear and indisputable to the ordinary citizen.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Statute Prohibiting Use of Mobile Telephones while Driving </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The State did not exceed its authority and impede privacy rights under the United States and New York Constitutions when enacting Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1225-c, which prohibits use of hand-held mobile telephones while operating a motor vehicle. Police powers concern balancing the regulating authority of the State and the rights of the individuals whose freedoms may be curtailed.  A law prohibiting the use of hand-held cell phones satisfies the State's interest in protecting the health, safety and welfare of its citizens and proper use of its police power.  The legislative intent sets forth the need to protect citizens from motor vehicle accidents and serious physical injuries that result from the use of hand-held cell phones. The only impediment placed upon the public is to refrain from using a hand-held cell phone while the car is in motion.  The citizen can speak after the car has stopped or may operate a &quot;hands-free&quot; cell phone. Accordingly, the State's regulation is reasonable in its intentions and is a valid use of the Legislature's police authority.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Statute Prohibiting Use of Mobile Telephones while Driving </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3.  Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1225-c, which prohibits use of hand-held mobile telephones while operating a motor vehicle, does not violate the Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses (US Const 14th Amend) due to the fact that the statute exempts calls to an emergency response operator, hospital, ambulance, fire department, health clinic, medical doctor's office, or police department, and calls made from &quot;authorized emergency vehicles&quot; which include ambulances, plus police and fire department ( Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1225-c [3] [a], [b]).  A legislative body may exempt certain situations and professions so long as the exclusions bear a reasonable relation to the desired legislative purpose. The law and its exclusions are not based on race, sex, age or national origins.  Therefore, no strict scrutiny test requiring or compelling governmental interest is necessary.  It is logical that a legislature would exempt those vehicles and professionals who need to make emergency calls as part of their employment, and extend this exemption to the ordinary citizen for these same reasons.  These calls are short in duration, thus limiting the long, distracting calls that are likely to result in an accident.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that Miranda warnings were not required before defendant made her statements to police because she was not under arrest, and subsequent questioning ended at defendant's request. Although showing one photograph for an identification was suggestive, the witness had an independent source for her identification. The blood test would not be suppressed under N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1194, the State asserted that defendant consented to the blood test. However, defendant was told, incorrectly, that if she did not give blood, her license or privilege to operate a vehicle would be revoked and her refusal to give blood could be used against her at a trial. Further, although she had not been arrested, the warnings given to her clearly implied, at least twice, that she had in fact been arrested. Under the circumstances, defendant's purported consent to give blood was simply a submission to authority. The State failed to meet its burden of demonstrating the legality of the police conduct in the first instance.

In defendant's prosecution for vehicular manslaughter and related offenses, the bartender who served defendant a drink prior to the accident and who identified defendant from a single photograph shown to her by the police may identify defendant at trial.  Although showing a person a single photograph is suggestive, the bartender spent several minutes talking to defendant in the bar, and thus had an independent source for her in-court identification of defendant.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In defendant's prosecution for vehicular manslaughter and related offenses, the blood alcohol test results from blood drawn at the hospital emergency room in the absence of a court order at a time that defendant was not yet under arrest are inadmissible where the People failed to establish that defendant validly consented to have her blood drawn.  Since the criteria for applying the implied consent statute (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1194) are not present in this case, and defendant had not otherwise been given an alco-sensor test, the People had the burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that defendant knowingly and voluntarily consented to give blood. Defendant suffered serious injuries in the accident in which her mother and her friend were killed.  Shortly after arriving at the hospital, where she was &quot;very upset&quot; and crying, she was incorrectly informed that if she did not give blood, her license or privilege to operate a vehicle would be revoked and her refusal to give blood could be used against her at a trial.  Further, although she had not been arrested, the warnings given to her clearly implied, at least twice, that she had in fact been arrested. Under these circumstances, defendant's purported consent to give blood was simply a &quot;submission to authority.&quot; Since the law and the consequences were misrepresented to defendant, the People failed to meet their burden of demonstrating the legality of the police conduct in the first instance. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding, petitioners, a community environmental group and individual community members, sought to enjoin further construction of a city development project. Respondents consisted of city and state governments and officials (city respondents), city agencies and authorities (authority respondents), and the project's developer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners claimed the authority respondents violated their duty under the New York State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA), N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 8-101 et seq., to take a &quot;hard look&quot; at the project to determine if alleged changes in the project's size required further environmental review. The court found the authority respondents sold the project's land, effectively ending their role, and the responsibility was with the city. Having found a viable claim against the city, the court ordered a factual hearing as to whether the claim was barred by the statute of limitations. The second cause of action alleged that the buildings department's approval of the project plans and issuance of a work permit exceeded its legal authority, violated the project covenant, and ran afoul of SEQRA. However, petitioners failed to exhaust administrative remedies, and the cause was dismissed. The third claim alleged an imminent change in federal regulations on carbon monoxide standards constituted a change in circumstances requiring further SEQRA review of the project. However, the regulations had not yet been enacted, and the claim was not ripe for judicial review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The authority respondents' motion to dismiss was granted in whole, the city respondents' and the developer's motions to dismiss were granted in part, denied in part, and held in abeyance in part pending a factual hearing, and the city respondents' motion for summary judgment was held in abeyance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation - Environmental Quality Review - Continuing Responsibility of Lead Agency to Examine Project Modifications after Proposed Action is Taken </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The City of New York, as the successor lead environmental review agency on a major commercial development project on property formerly owned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, has the continuing obligation under the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) to insure that the project size limitations imposed by the 1997 final supplemental environmental impact statement (FSEIS) and the covenant executed by the project developer upon the sale of the property are followed by the developer. When the Authority respondents sold the property to the developer on July 31, 2000, they lost all decision-making authority over the project and effectively relinquished their status as lead agency to the City, which, by virtue of the covenant, is now specifically entrusted with the exclusive authority to enforce the limitations contained in the 1997 FSEIS.  A lead agency's responsibility under SEQRA to examine changes to a project does not end simply because the agency has issued its statement of findings and has taken the proposed action, especially where, as here, the construction is still ongoing.  The only way to fully implement the policies underlying SEQRA is to hold that a lead agency has a continuing duty to ensure that conditions derived through the SEQRA process are followed by the project developer after the proposed action has been taken (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;6 NYCRR 617.6 [b] [6] [i] [a]; 617.9 [a] [7]).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, city and county, sought judgment providing for the demolition of a burned, unsalvageable building, compensation for the costs thereof, and an injunction restraining the expenditure of fire insurance proceeds. Defendant estate sought a holding that it did not owe the cost of demolition. The estate and its individual defendants also sought a dismissal of the complaint and enforcement of an alleged contract to demolish the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that a contract implied in law between the city and the estate by which the city would demolish the structure at no cost to the estate was void because the contract bestowed an unconstitutional gift of services upon the estate. The city could not demolish private property and not charge the owner for the cost of its services because a failure to charge was an unconstitutional gift in violation of N.Y. Const. art. 8, &sect; 1. The estate did not dispute that the property should have been demolished, nor did it oppose the demolition. The court found that no contract was formed between the parties. While the estate did make a prima facie case for a contract implied in law, the same was not enforceable because it violated the New York State Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment was granted to the city and county. The estate owed the cost of demolition. An inquest to establish the amount owing was set. The estate was enjoined from expending $ 15,000 of the insurance proceeds pending the inquest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Gift of Public Funds - Demolition of Private Property at Taxpayers' Expense - Municipality Required to Seek Reimbursement for Demolition of Public Nuisance </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant, the owner of a fire-damaged, unsalvageable building demolished by plaintiff municipalities as a public nuisance, is liable for plaintiffs' demolition costs.  There are no enforceable contracts which would release defendant from the obligation to reimburse plaintiffs for the cost of demolition. The contract implied in law claimed by defendant by which plaintiffs allegedly agreed to demolish defendant's structure at no cost to defendant would be void and unenforceable as violative of the constitutional prohibition against a municipality bestowing a gift of public funds or services for the benefit of a private party (NY Const, art VIII, &sect; 1). If a municipality remediates a nuisance or violation of law as a service for a private property owner, the constitutional gifts provision mandates that the municipality make all reasonable efforts to obtain reimbursement for the cost of the remediation. Moreover, constitutional requirements cannot be satisfied by the imposition of a special assessment charge against the property (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;General City Law &sect; 20 [35]) where the property is not of sufficient value to reimburse for the cost of demolition. Plaintiffs' customs and practices of allowing substantially deteriorated privately owned property to be foreclosed for unpaid taxes, and then demolishing the property without seeking full restitution, is unconstitutional under the gifts provision.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Gift of Public Funds - Demolition of Private Property at Taxpayers' Expense - Selective Enforcement </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant, the owner of a fire-damaged, unsalvageable building demolished by plaintiff municipalities as a public nuisance, is liable for plaintiffs' demolition costs.  Defendant may not assert a defense of &quot;selective enforcement&quot; based upon plaintiffs' long-standing policy of not seeking restitution from property owners for demolition costs and allowing property not in code compliance to be taken for unpaid real estate taxes.  While plaintiffs' code enforcement has previously been inadequate, defendant cannot demonstrate that plaintiffs' decision to now seek reimbursement was predicated upon &quot;invidious discrimination&quot; against a constitutionally protected group.  Plaintiffs have a duty to enforce their housing and sanitary codes and to promptly abate public nuisances which may affect the public health (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Public Health Law &sect; 1304).  Plaintiffs violated the constitutional prohibition against a municipality bestowing a gift of public funds or services for the benefit of a private party (NY Const, art VIII, &sect; 1) by delaying the enforcement of the codes and allowing nuisances to exist until taking a property for taxes and then demolishing damaged structures at taxpayers' expense.  Under these circumstances, defendant cannot be deemed to be a member of a class suffering &quot;invidious discrimination.&quot; </SPAN></P>

The safehouse refused to return her prior to the expiration of the 30-day period set forth in &sect; 532-b. The father, therefore, brought a writ of habeas corpus. The court held that the intent of &sect; 532-b was to reunite families. The safehouse acted in place of the state to protect the daughter's interests by offering her a safe place to reside and other needed assistance. However, the father's interests in the immediate return of his daughter also had to be considered. By not providing a balancing of the interests, &sect; 532-b placed the safehouse in a position that was superior to the father.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act of 1978, which provides that a runaway youth &quot;may&quot; remain in an approved Safehouse for a period not to exceed 30 days from the date of admission ( Executive Law &sect; 532-b [2]), does not prohibit the parent of a runaway child residing in such a Safehouse from filing a writ of habeas corpus seeking return of the child prior to the expiration of the 30-day period.  Preventing a parent from applying to the court for a period of 30 days does not promote the purpose of the Act, which is to reunite families while also providing &quot;appropriate services to help runaway youth cope with their problems.&quot; In the interests of reuniting a family, a parent must be able to address the issues that drove the family apart.  A prohibition, even for a period of 30 days, is an infringement of the parent's due process rights.  Consequently, Executive Law &sect; 532-b would be unconstitutional as applied if construed to preclude the parent from filing a writ of habeas corpus for the first 30 days.  In balancing both the child's and parent's due process rights, a hearing is required to determine whether the best interests of the child will be served by remaining in the Safehouse or by the return of the child.  The child will have the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that his or her best interests would be served by not returning home immediately.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A report of suspected child abuse was filed with the Nassau Department of Social Services (New York) with respect to petitioner father's children. The father sought to have his name removed from the New York State Central Registry. The application for expungement was denied. The matter was referred to the Bureau of Special Hearings. The father commenced the instant proceeding by order to show cause and secured a stay of the fair hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A father sought declaration that sections of the social services law, as applied to him, were violative of procedural due process on the grounds that the statutes and regulations failed to mandate a hearing prior to submission of a name to the registry and failed to mandate a time in which a hearing had to be conducted. The supreme court rejected the registrar's argument that the father lacked standing because the father sufficiently demonstrated that his inclusion in the registry satisfied the &quot;stigma plus&quot; standard which invoked the protections of procedural due process by showing that inclusion could impact his future employment or adoption opportunities. The court held that the challenged statutes were constitutional and reasonable because the inconvenience experienced by the father was far outweighed by the strong need to protect children from abuse. The imperative of due process was satisfied where a report was substantiated by a fair preponderance of the evidence and was not disseminated when the report was not relevant to the inquiring agency. The failure to set forth a time in which a hearing had to occur could be remedied by a proceeding to compel a hearing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Petitioner, whose name was placed on the New York State Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment pursuant to Social Services Law &sect; 422 based solely upon the initial &quot;indicated&quot; finding of child abuse involving his four children, has standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statutory scheme as being violative of due process by permitting respondents to enter a name in the Register prior to conducting a fair hearing, and failing to provide a time limit in which a hearing must be conducted after a request to expunge.  Although mere stigma alone is insufficient to invoke procedural due process protection, given the nature and severity of an &quot;indicated&quot; child abuse determination, petitioner has sufficiently demonstrated that his inclusion in the Register satisfies the &quot;stigma plus&quot; standard that invokes the protections of procedural due process.  The reality of the impact of the inclusion of one's name in a register of child abusers is sufficient to satisfy the &quot;stigma plus&quot; test.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Petitioner, whose name was placed on the New York State Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment pursuant to Social Services Law &sect; 422 based solely upon the initial &quot;indicated&quot; finding of child abuse involving his four children, has failed to demonstrate that the statutory scheme is violative of due process because it does not require a hearing prior to his name being entered into the Register. The statutory scheme provides for the investigation of an initial report of abuse by the local child protective agency.  That investigation results in a determination either that the report was unfounded, in which case the matter is closed, or a determination that the report was &quot;indicated,&quot; based on &quot;credible evidence,&quot; in which case the report is kept on file in the Register. Procedural due process only requires that a report be substantiated by a fair preponderance of the evidence at a hearing, or that the time to move for expungement have expired prior to the dissemination of the information to providers or licensing agencies. Consequently, the use of a lower &quot;credible evidence&quot; standard during the investigation stage is not violative of due process.  The interest of children to be shielded from abuse must take precedence, especially since a party's rights are otherwise amply protected in the statutory scheme before a report of abuse can be disseminated. Furthermore, the fact that the statutory scheme and its regulations set no specific time limit for the holding of an expungement hearing does not constitute a constitutional infirmity. </SPAN></P>

She claimed that the instrument lacked facts showing the necessary intent to harass, annoy, threaten or alarm the victim because she did not speak to the victim, did not ask to speak to the victim, and did not know that the victim would be eavesdropping on the threatening call taken by a third person. She alleged that the charges should be dismissed in the interest of justice. The motion was denied because the mother called the place of employment of the victim and left a threatening message.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. An accusatory instrument charging defendant with aggravated harassment ( Penal Law &sect; 240.30 [1]) for making an annoying and threatening phone call to a hospital nurse directed at complainant, the program director of children services in the hospital where defendant's five-year-old son was a patient, is sufficient on its face even though defendant did not actually communicate the threat directly to complainant.  The accusatory instrument alleges that there was verbally aggressive behavior by defendant toward complainant over a period of four weeks, followed by six telephone calls by defendant to complainant within the two hours preceding the threats conveyed via the agitated telephone message left with the nurse. Under these circumstances, the statute encompasses complainant as an intended victim. The elements of the crime are satisfied by a communication intentionally made to one individual which causes alarm to a third person. The statute does not require that the subject of the harassing communication be the same person to whom the communication is made.  Moreover, whether complainant overheard the phone conversation or was advised of it by the direct recipient is of no consequence, since the nature of the communication was such that defendant's threat was reasonably intended by her to be passed on to complainant.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant may lawfully be charged with aggravated harassment ( Penal Law &sect; 240.30 [1]) for making an annoying and threatening phone call to a hospital nurse directed at complainant, the program director of children services in the hospital where defendant's five-year-old son was a patient. The harassment statute, as applied to defendant, is not violative of defendant's rights to freedom of speech. The accusatory instrument alleges that there was verbally aggressive behavior by defendant toward complainant over a period of four weeks, followed by six telephone calls by defendant to complainant within the two hours preceding the threats conveyed via the agitated telephone message left with the nurse. Under these circumstances, a jury reasonably could find that defendant's communications escalated in intensity and specificity to the point that they instilled fear of impending or imminent, if not immediate, danger of severe harm in the mind of the alleged victim.  Furthermore, the statute, as applied, is not so vague and overbroad as to violate defendant's due process rights.  The very nature of the alleged threat in issue, and its communication to the institution where the victim is employed, removes the possibility that defendant could have been unaware of the criminal nature of her conduct.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. 21 NYCRR 1050.7 (e), which states that &quot;No person on or in any [transit] facility or conveyance shall ... (e) create any sound through the use of any sound production device, except as authorized by section 1050.6(c) of this Part,&quot; but permits &quot;use of radios and other devices listened to solely by headphones or earphones and inaudible to others,&quot; is not unconstitutionally vague. The regulation incorporates by reference the provisions of another regulation scientifically defining &quot;excessive noise.&quot; That regulation specifies maximum sound levels permitted on subway trains and sets forth the manner in which sound is to be measured. Accordingly, the regulations in question provide adequate notice to the public of the forbidden conduct and contain objective standards for law enforcement personnel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Information - Legal Sufficiency - Disorderly Conduct - Excessive Noise </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. An information charging defendant with disorderly conduct in violation of a regulation prohibiting the playing of radios on subways is facially insufficient.  The regulation prohibits noise in transit facilities which exceeds certain levels as measured in a specified way.  Under this provision, an accusatory instrument is not facially sufficient if it merely states that a radio is audible.  Because the information does not allege that the sound emitted by defendant's radio was measured and that it exceeded the permissible levels, the accusatory instrument fails to state every element of the offense and is thus jurisdictionally defective.  Moreover, the failure to measure the radio's sound made it impossible for the People to draft and file a facially sufficient information. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Condemnor and claimant both filed motions to re-settle the judgment to be entered as it related to interest on condemnation awards made on properties taken in prior vesting actions. Claimant sought pre-judgment interest at the nine percent permitted by the statute, while condemnor urged interest at six percent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Condemnor asked the court to consider the &quot;virtual risk free&quot; nature of the condemnation award as warranting a lower rate. The court noted various appellate and trial courts had sustained the nine percent rate for relevant interest periods, essentially determining that the various objectants to the nine percent rate failed to persuade that the presumptively reasonable statutory rate was &quot;unreasonably high.&quot; The court observed it did not appear that under the facts, there could be any further arguments advanced for a lower rate that would be any more persuasive than those raised and rejected by both the appellate and trial courts. Accordingly, the court opined that the nine percent rate had sufficiently and significantly withstood challenge both at the trial and appellate level to warrant its preclusive application to the interest periods at issue without further examination as to its propriety. Further, the court advised a finding of a lesser rate for the judgments than that fixed by the court for condemnation awards for relevant interest periods would be unconstitutionally discriminatory, and therefore unreasonable and palpably improper.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interest - Prejudgment Interest - Condemnation Award - Propriety of Statutory 9% Rate </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statutory maximum 9% prejudgment interest rate ( CPLR 5004) is the appropriate rate to be applied to the condemnation awards on properties taken in 1994 and 1995.  To ensure that a condemnee obtains just compensation, the state is constitutionally required to pay prejudgment interest for delay in making payment and deprivation of use of the property. The 9% rate has sufficiently and significantly withstood judicial challenge to warrant its preclusive application herein without further examination as to its propriety.  Uncertainty as to the judgment rate would turn entry of judgment, presently a clerk-administered function, into a postverdict litigated matter further burdening the trial court.  Furthermore, any differentiation of rates for condemnation awards covering the same interest periods would be unconstitutionally discriminatory, and therefore &quot;unreasonable and palpably improper.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a declaratory judgment action by plaintiff humane society and others challenging defendant New York City Board of Health's amendment to New York City, N.Y., R. tit. 42, &sect; 161.01, designating ferrets as prohibited wild animals, an individual plaintiff moved for leave to depose public officials and to discover documents outside the official record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">New York City's Board of Health amended New York City, N.Y., R. tit. 42, &sect; 161.01, which listed wild animals that could not be kept as pets in the city, to include ferrets. An individual plaintiff joined the humane society's challenge to the rule. Because of his previous activities as an advocate of ferrets as pets, the individual plaintiff believed the board's action was motivated in part by individual members' animosity toward him. He therefore sought to depose several board members and other officials and to discover written materials, not part of the agency record, that might indicate improper motives. The court held that since the legislature had empowered the board to make all health-related legislative decisions relating to New York City, the board's processes were protected by the speech and debate clause of N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 11. Therefore, the materials sought were all privileged.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Plaintiff's request for depositions from members of the New York City Board of Health and other public officials in connection with his challenge to the validity of the 1999 amendment to the New York City Health Code, which established a list of prohibited wild animals that includes ferrets (24 RCNY 161.01), is barred by the common-law legislative immunity privilege applicable to government officials in the executive branch when engaged in legislative activities.  The common-law privilege applies to the adoption of legislative-type rules by an agency such as the Board of Health.  The privilege ordinarily precludes disclosure as to the officials' deliberations and motivations in passing a rule or regulation. The applicability of the privilege may not be avoided based on plaintiff's unsupported allegations that the members of the Board of Health acted from bias against him or against pet ferrets. Nor may the privilege be avoided based on plaintiff's claim that he only seeks to inquire into what the officials' &quot;actual conduct was prior to making their decision.&quot; Plaintiff's request for depositions is prohibited by the privilege regardless of how plaintiff seeks to characterize the nature of the inquiry.  Furthermore, plaintiff's request for documents outside the official record which may have been considered and rejected by the Board of Health in connection with its adoption of the challenged rule is likewise barred by the legislative immunity privilege in the absence of any objective evidence tending to show that the impetus for the rule was illicit bias or prejudice.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that N.Y. Civ.

However, the court held that it lacked authority to entertain the motion arguing that the ban on audio-visual coverage was unconstitutional.&nbsp;N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 52 imposed an absolute, generalized ban on audio-visual coverage of trial court proceedings, no matter what the circumstances of the case or the assessment of the proceeding judge. Where a movant had no constitutional or statutory right to broadcast, the court was without authority to permit it to intervene.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon remand from the Appellate Division (New York), the family court returned custody of the child to respondent father, and rejected the claims of petitioner foster mother seeking visitation and custody rights to the child. However, the family court reserved the question of whether the child had an independent constitutional right to seek visitation with the foster mother and allowed the parties to file briefs on the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The family court answered the question of whether the child had an independent constitutional right to seek visitation with the foster mother in the affirmative. It held, generally, that a child had a constitutional right to maintain contact with a person with whom he had developed a parent-like relationship. Accompanying that right, was a right to the equal protection of the laws. This required that a child have the due process necessary to claim his right. This claim could be given constitutional protection, while at the same time giving due recognition, respect, and protection to a parent's constitutional right to the custody, care, and control of his or her child. The family court then outlined a procedure by which the fundamental right of the father to direct the care, custody, and guardianship of his child could be balanced with the fundamental rights of the child. The procedure would consist of a standing hearing to determine if the child had a parent-like relationship with the foster mother, with whom contact was desired; and upon a finding of standing, a subsequent hearing would be held to determine whether continued contact was in the child's best interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parent and Child - Visitation - Visitation Rights of Person with Parent-Like Relationship </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. A child has a constitutional right to maintain contact, over the objection of a parent, with a person with whom the child has developed a parent-like relationship.  The historical development of family law in America and the expansion of individual constitutional rights by the United States Supreme Court and the New York State Court of Appeals support this holding.  A child has certain enumerated and unenumerated constitutionally protected rights which are protected coextensively by the United States and New York Constitutions.  The child's unenumerated rights include a fundamental right to maintain contact with a person with whom the child has developed a parent-like relationship.  The child also has an enumerated First Amendment freedom of association right under the New York and United States Constitutions to maintain personal relations with a nonbiologically related person.  These rights are liberty interests protected by the Due Process Clauses of the United States and New York Constitutions.  Furthermore, equal protection of the laws entitles the child to be similarly situated with other children who have a statutory procedure to enforce constitutionally or statutorily protected association rights.  A child having such a right must be provided a process to enforce that right against unwarranted restrictions by the state or the parent.  The fundamental right of the parent to direct the care, custody and guardianship of his or her child must be balanced with the fundamental rights of the child.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parent and Child - Visitation - Visitation Rights of Person with Parent-Like Relationship </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In determining whether a child has a constitutional right to maintain contact, over the objection of a parent, with a person with whom the child has developed a parent-like relationship, the child initially must allege facts which, if proven, would establish that the child has developed a parent-like relationship with another person and that his or her custodial parent has refused contact or arbitrarily restricted established contact. The court will then conduct a standing hearing.  Upon a finding of standing, the court will conduct a hearing to determine if continued contact is in the child's best interest and to what extent such contact is appropriate.  In determining what is in the child's best interest, the court will take into account the circumstances usually considered when making such determinations and also consider: how the relationship was formed and whether the parent objected or consented to any aspect of the relationship's formation and continuation; the length, nature and quality of the relationship; and whether any court-ordered contact would significantly interfere with the parent-child relationship or with the parent's rightful authority over the child.  It will be presumed that the parent's decision to restrict or terminate contact is in the child's best interest. The child will carry the burden of proving all relevant issues by a preponderance of the evidence.  The court must give significant weight to the parent's determination as to what is in the child's best interest, including the decision to allow a certain level of contact.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendant attacked a stranger while the stranger was returning home from a bar frequented by homosexual men. The victim told police that the defendant repeatedly cursed him and called him a &quot;faggot&quot; and a &quot;degenerate&quot; during the attack, and the defendant told police that he attacked the victim because he was angry about comments he heard on a radio talk show about homosexual men molesting children and had decided to vent his anger by attacking a person he thought was homosexual. The defendant was charged with a felony because he had selected his victim based on his belief that the victim was homosexual. The trial court held that (1) there was a presumption that the Hate Crimes Act of 2000, N.Y.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Hate Crimes Act of 2000 (Penal Law &sect;&sect; 485.00-485.10), which enhances the penalties for certain crimes committed because of the offender's bias or prejudice, is not unconstitutionally vague. The language of the Act is clear and can reasonably be understood by all citizens to prohibit certain kinds of attacks made against others who have been selected by the offender because of a perception as to the victim's special vulnerability, appearance, or background.  The notions embodied in the Act have long been used in the sentencing process to enhance penalties for criminal behavior. The Act simply provides that such enhancement may take place in every case where such victim selection has occurred by permitting the prosecution to submit such behavior to the trier of fact as an additional element of the underlying offense. Moreover, the language of the Act does not lend itself to arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The Act provides objective criteria which must be observed throughout the accusatory process, and does not provide for enforcement according to the subjective conclusions of the complainant, police or prosecutor. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant legally unsophisticated house cleaner contracted to advertise in the publisher's Yellow Pages. She never paid the bill, and the publisher obtained a default judgment against her, which the advertiser sought to vacate.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defendant is entitled to a factual hearing on her motion to vacate a default judgment entered against her for an unpaid fee for advertising published by plaintiff.  Factual issues exist as to whether service was properly effectuated on a member of defendant's household, whether defendant has a meritorious defense because it is unclear from the single signature line utilized on plaintiff's form contract whether defendant was binding herself personally on behalf of a sole proprietorship or was merely acting on behalf of corporate party, and whether the language in the parties' contract providing that the contract is &quot;deemed transacted in Nassau County&quot; is sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction over defendant.  Furthermore, on plaintiff's motion for reargument, an unpublished summary decision of the Appellate Term involving a similar claim for unpaid advertising fees in which it was determined that the agreement therein &quot;clearly and unambiguously made the defendant individually liable&quot; is not entitled to be given controlling stare decisis effect in the absence of a recitation of any of the adjudicated facts.  Likewise, a second unpublished summary decision of the Appellate Term in which it was determined that the same jurisdictional clause &quot;was sufficient to establish the basis for personal jurisdiction over defendant&quot; cannot be considered binding precedent in the absence of the specific legal grounds upon which the decision was based.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with attempted murder in the second degree as a hate crime and related offenses. Defendant asked the court to permit him to file a motion challenging the constitutionality of the hate crimes legislation,&nbsp;N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 485.00.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought leave of the court to file an untimely motion challenging the constitutionality of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 485.00. The court held that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 255.20 required that all pretrial motions be included in the same set of motion papers and that the motion was required to be served or filed within 45 days of arraignment. Defendant relied on the second of the two exceptions contained in N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 255.20, that the untimely motion should be heard and decided for good cause shown and in the interest of justice. The court held that it was the duty of the court to protect the fundamental rights of all citizens. The court found there were adverse consequences which preclusion of the motion might have had on the defendant's fundamental rights. If defendant could have mounted a legitimate challenge to the constitutionality of the statute, preclusion of that challenge based upon the possible oversights or carelessness of his counsel might have resulted in reversal of any conviction on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defendant's motion for leave to file a motion challenging the constitutionality of the recently enacted &quot;Hate Crimes&quot; legislation after the 45-day deadline for filing pretrial motions contained in CPL 255.20 has passed is granted in the interest of justice.  CPL 255.20 requires that all pretrial motions be included in the same set of motion papers and served or filed within 45 days of arraignment. A defendant who has failed to act in a timely fashion may still be entitled to relief if the consequences of his or her tardiness would affect the accuracy and fairness of the truth-finding process of the trial.  The constitutionality of the Hate Crimes legislation remains an open question for the courts to consider, and a preclusion of that challenge based on the oversight or carelessness of defendant's counsel in not making a timely challenge could possibly result in the reversal of any conviction on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Parolee was told he had to give a blood sample for a DNA data bank or else his parole would be violated. The law that required the sample was passed after parolee was convicted. He allowed the sample to be taken under protest. He then filed a declaratory action to have the law declared unconstitutional. The court held that the law was not an ex post facto law since it did not change the definition of any criminal conduct and was not punitive. In addition, parolee was not prosecuted nor punished a second time for the same crimes. Thus, there was no double jeopardy issue. Taking of the blood sample was not so invasive as to constitute an unreasonable search and seizure. The sample was to be used in a statewide data bank and not in an investigation of parolee for a particular crime. Parolee failed to prove that the law was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Although the amendment is applicable to plaintiff regarding events that occurred before the enactment of the amendment and did disadvantage him, the amendment did not change the definition of any criminal conduct and is not punitive in nature.  The intent of the amendment was not to punish persons such as plaintiff for past behavior but to expand the definition of persons who must submit tissue samples to the state DNA data bank pursuant to Executive Law &sect; 995-c so as to assist law enforcement officials in accurately solving crimes committed by persons already convicted of serious crimes and thus promoting public safety.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The builders were in the process of complying with contingencies on their applications to build nursing homes, when the department issued a moratorium on all such applications. The builders filed motions in the nature of mandamus for orders that the department had an affirmative duty to continue processing their applications. They claimed the moratorium constituted a rule made in violation of the state administrative procedures act. The court held that absent a revised public needs determination, the current determination continued in effect. The moratorium violated the builders' due process rights. In addition, it was in the form of a rule, which required a public needs determination pursuant to the administrative procedures act.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The moratorium issued by the New York State Department of Health (Department) on the further processing of nursing home applications that have been approved by the Public Health Council, but not yet approved by the Department to begin construction, is vacated, and respondent Commissioner is directed to continue processing petitioners' applications.  The moratorium--which has no end date--denies petitioners due process since it has the practical effect of imperiling their projects without providing them with any redress or mechanism of appeal.  While, initially, compelling the Department to process the applications is contingent upon its discretionary finding as to the public need for construction of the proposed nursing homes, such a finding has been made and is in effect.  Respondent is not being compelled to make any particular determination but, rather, to follow the procedures mandated by law relative to the processing of petitioners' applications (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Public Health Law &sect; 206 [1] [a]).  Moreover, the moratorium is a rule, and respondent failed to comply with the rule-making requirements of the State Administrative Procedure Act before imposing the moratorium. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, public employees' union and others, filed suit seeking a declaration that 1998 N.Y. Laws ch. 641 did not violate the Home Rule provision of the state constitution, N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2, and moved for summary judgment. Defendants, the City of New York (city) and state and city agencies, filed a cross-motion seeking a declaration that Chapter 641 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1996, the New York State Legislature enacted 1996 N.Y. Laws ch. 13 over the governor's veto. That statute transferred impasse jurisdiction over collective bargaining disputes between the City of New York and the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association (PBA) from the Board of Collective Bargaining of the City of New York (BCB) to the New York State Public Relations Board (PERB). However, a court ruled that Chapter 13 was unconstitutional because it applied only to New York City and, as such, violated N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2. In response to that ruling, the legislature enacted 1998 N.Y. Laws ch. 641. Chapter 641 extended PERB's impasse jurisdiction to the entire state, and removed restrictions on that jurisdiction with respect to collective bargaining negotiations with the New York City police. The court held that Chapter 641 did not violate N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2 because it was a general law that applied to all local governments and that the legislature may act by general law in areas of general state concern, even though the enactment may touch upon the property, affairs, or government of municipalities and circumscribe local authority in that area.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and declared that N.Y. Laws ch. 641 did not violate the Home Rule provision of state constitution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Chapter 641 of the Laws of 1998, which, in order to overcome the Home Rule constitutional defects in a prior statute (L 1996, ch 13) that transferred impasse jurisdiction of collective bargaining disputes between the City of New York and its police force from the City's Board of Collective Bargaining to the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB), extends PERB's impasse jurisdiction to all organized fire and police departments within the State (Civil Service Law &sect; 212 [3]), is not violative of the Home Rule provisions of the State Constitution.  Unlike the prior &quot;special&quot; law, chapter 641 is a &quot;general&quot; law (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 3 [d] [1]) designed to make PERB's collective bargaining dispute procedures available to all police and firefighters' unions across the State.  Moreover, the fact that chapter 641 contains a grandfather clause permitting existing local boards to retain impasse jurisdiction at the option of the collective bargaining agent does not constitute a Home Rule violation.  By its terms and its effect, chapter 641 treats all local governments alike in meeting the Legislature's purpose of prohibiting local governments from denying access to PERB's impasse resolution procedures to police and firefighters' unions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Public Employees' Fair Employment Act - Impasse Jurisdiction of Public Employment Relations Board Regarding Police and Firefighters' Union - Jurisdiction of Scope of Bargaining and Impasse Resolution Issues </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Chapter 641 of the Laws of 1998, which extends the impasse jurisdiction of the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) to all organized fire and police departments within the State (Civil Service Law &sect; 212 [3]), must be construed to place jurisdiction of scope of bargaining issues, including when the scope of bargaining dispute is pursued through the vehicle of an improper practice charge, with PERB and not with a local body such as New York City's Board of Collective Bargaining (BCB).  In order to determine if an impasse exists with respect to the conditions of employment, PERB must have the power to determine what the &quot;conditions of employment&quot; are in order to meet its statutory mandate with regard to impasse resolution.  Consequently, under the statutory scheme, PERB has jurisdiction of scope of bargaining and impasse resolution issues arising out of collective negotiations between the City of New York and its police union, with the BCB retaining jurisdiction of improper practice complaints not related to scope of bargaining or impasse resolution.  Cumbersome and time-consuming processes that would have two separate agencies on two different levels of government attempting to separately resolve the intertwined issues of scope of bargaining and impasse resolution would violate the legislative policy underlying the Public Employees' Fair Employment Act. </SPAN></P>

During the last visit between plaintiff and her granddaughter, the child, who was lactose intolerant, broke out in hives.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 72, which provided that grandparents had standing to petition for visitation where either parent was deceased or where circumstances showed that conditions existed which equity would see fit to intervene, did not violate the Troxel doctrine. The Troxel doctrine held that a similar statute unconstitutionally violated the substantive due process rights of parents to the care, custody, and control of their children. The court held that the Troxel doctrine explicitly contemplated that a state could permit grandparent visitation in extraordinary circumstances, and that extraordinary circumstances existed in this case. Testimony indicated that plaintiff had been a loving and devoted grandmother. The court found no evidence that plaintiff had fed the child ice cream, which defendant claimed caused the attack of hives. While defendant was not unfit, there was ample evidence that she found parenting difficult. The Department of Social Services had opened a preventive case against defendant, and had investigated several abuse or neglect charges against defendant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Domestic Relations Law &sect; 72, which allows grandparents to apply to court for visitation where either or both of the grandchild's parents are dead or in any circumstances that warrant the equitable intervention of the court, is constitutional.  A statute should be construed in a manner which would remove doubt of its constitutionality.  Here, courts can remove doubt as to the constitutionality of section 72 by requiring that special weight be accorded the preference of parents.  This preference must be respected absent extraordinary circumstances. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parent and Child - Visitation Rights of Grandparents </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Petitioner paternal grandmother is granted visitation rights with her two-year-old granddaughter, notwithstanding objections by the biological mother.  Domestic Relations Law &sect; 72 grants grandparents standing to petition for visitation where &quot;circumstances show that conditions exist which equity would see fit to intervene.&quot; If the grandparent makes that hurdle, the court, in resolving the visitation dispute, &quot;may make such directions as the best interest of the child may require&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">id.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">).  The biological father is incarcerated and the grandmother and her family have a strong and long-standing relationship with the child from birth. Thus, a significantly reduced role for the grandmother in the child's life would be seriously detrimental to the child.  In addition, any visitation concerns of the mother, who finds parenting difficult, appear pretextual and are easily addressed by an appropriate order. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a death penalty case, the People sought an order requiring defendant before trial to file a notice of intention to offer psychiatric evidence pursuant to N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant acknowledged that he did not intend to offer psychiatric evidence during the guilt phase of trial, and had not filed a notice of intent to proffer psychiatric evidence pursuant to N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed a motion challenging the constitutionality of the guilty plea provisions of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law art. 220 and N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;&sect;250.40, 400.27, as they had been interpreted by prior New York case law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with first degree murder, second degree murder, and first degree rape. Plaintiff filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, notice, pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;250.40. Defendant had not sought to enter a guilty plea, either before or after the notice was filed. Nonetheless, defendant filed the motion, alleging that the guilty plea provisions of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law art. 220 and N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;&sect;250.40, 400.27, as interpreted by the New York Court of Appeals, were unconstitutional. Defendant requested that the notice be stricken and that he be allowed to enter a guilty plea if he so chose, or that he be allowed to offer argument at sentencing that the law prohibited him from entering a guilty plea. The court of appeals had held, in two earlier decisions, that art. 220 prohibited a guilty plea while a notice was pending, and that plaintiff's statutory authority to file a notice within 120 days of arraignment overrode a defendant's unconditional right to plead guilty to an indictment. The trial court denied defendant's constitutional challenges, stating that it was bound by the earlier decisions of the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's motion was denied in its entirety, because prior New York case law had excised the unconstitutional guilty plea provisions of the New York death penalty statute, and the resulting death penalty statute, like all statutes, carried a strong presumption of constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants moved to dismiss count five of an indictment which charged them both with gang assault in the first degree in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect;120.07.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were alleged to have gotten into a car after an argument with rival gang members, and individually and simultaneously fired shots from their car while being driven by a fourth. Defendants moved to dismiss one count of the indictment, arguing that the wording of the statute allowed charges to be brought without an ascertainment of whether a defendant was actually in a gang. The trial court found that the word &quot;gang&quot; as used in the gang assault statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Penal Law &sect;120.07, had no associational implications but was limited to the requirement that a minimum of three persons be actually present and participating in the assault, and directed that the jury would be so instructed. Further, the court found that there was no doubt that defendants' alleged conduct met the elements of the crime of gang assault, specifically the requirement that at least three persons be &quot;actually present&quot; as participants in the crime as required by the statute. As such, defendants' motion was denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Gang Assault - Facial Constitutionality </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Penal Law &sect; 120.07, gang assault in the first degree, is not facially unconstitutional on the ground that the wording and title of the statute allow the prosecution to denominate an individual charged under its provisions as being a gang member without proof or without a hearing to measure the probative value of such evidence against its potential for undue prejudice in violation of the due process rights of the accused.  A person is guilty under the statute &quot;when, with intent to cause serious physical injury to another person and when aided by two or more other persons actually present, he causes serious physical injury to such person or to a third person.&quot; The primary concern motivating the enactment of the statute is to impose a harsher penalty for an assault committed by multiple assailants. The word &quot;gang&quot; does not appear in the statutory description of the crime.  There is no element requiring that any of the participants in the offense be affiliated with an organization or even with each other prior to the commission of the assault. The only requirement under Penal Law &sect; 120.07, other than the intentional infliction of injury, is that there be at least three persons actually present to assist in the commission of the assault. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Gang Assault - Unconstitutional Vagueness - Element of Aid by Two or More Persons Actually Present </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Penal Law &sect; 120.07, which provides that a person is guilty of gang assault in the first degree &quot;when, with intent to cause serious physical injury to another person and when aided by two or more other persons actually present, he causes serious physical injury to such person or to a third person,&quot; is not unconstitutional as applied because the element requiring that two or more persons be &quot;actually present&quot; for the commission of the assault is unconstitutionally vague. The aggravating element, &quot;aided by another person actually present,&quot; means that the participants in the assault must be physically present, willing and able to render immediate aid to one another, and must, by their presence, pose an additional risk of violence.  There is no vagueness in this element of the crime of gang assault. Thus, in a prosecution of three defendants in which the evidence indicates that the defendants, accompanied by a fourth person, were together in an automobile and individually and simultaneously fired shots from the car window allegedly causing death to one victim and serious physical injury to another, defendants' alleged conduct meets the elements of the crime of gang assault, specifically the requirement that at least three persons be &quot;actually present&quot; as participants in the crime.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with two counts of aggravated harassment in the second degree (N.Y. Penal Law &sect;240.30(1), (2)) and one count of harassment in the second degree (N.Y. Penal Law &sect;240.26(1)). Defendant moved to dismiss the purported information on grounds of facial insufficiency pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;&sect;100.45, 170.30, 170.35.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant telephoned a government agency, spoke with an employee, and threatened to start killing judges and some lawyers so that people would start to listen to defendant. There was no allegation that the recipient of the phone call was personally threatened by defendant, that defendant knew the name of the person who answered the phone, or that defendant identified any particular individual by name. The court dismissed the charge of harassment in the second degree because &sect; 240.26 required that the recipient of the threat and the target of the threat be one and the same individual. Defendant's motion to dismiss the charge of aggravated harassment under &sect; 240.30(1)) was denied because there was no statutory requirement that the target of the threat be specified or identified. The defendant's motion to dismiss the charge of aggravated harassment under &sect; 240.30(2) was denied because when non-hearsay allegations set forth that a caller has threatened criminal behavior, that communication was inherently illegitimate for the purposes of facial sufficiency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Harassment charge was dismissed because the recipient of the threat and the target of the threat were not the same person. Aggravated harassment charges were sustained because there was no statutory requirement that the target be specified, and non-hearsay allegations setting forth illegitimate communications were sufficient for the purposes of facial sufficiency.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Aggravated Harassment - Target of Threat Need Not be Specified </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The target of a threat need not be specified or identified in the accusatory instrument in order to establish a prima facie case of aggravated harassment in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 240.30 [1]).  The statute provides that a person is guilty of such crime &quot;when, with intent to harass, annoy, threaten or alarm another person, he or she ... [c]ommunicates, or causes a communication to be initiated by mechanical or electronic means or otherwise, with a person, anonymously, or otherwise ... in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm.&quot; The statute's use of the words &quot;another person&quot; in the opening paragraph and the use of the words &quot;a person&quot; referred to in subdivision (1) evinces a legislative intent that the subject of the communication need not be the same person to whom the communication is made.  The statutory language does not set forth that the target of the threat must be identified or specified.  Furthermore, there is nothing in the statute which indicates that the threatening communication must be directed at anyone in particular.  Thus, an information that sets forth in sum and substance that defendant made a telephone call which was received by the complainant, and that during the conversation the defendant made threats targeted to third persons causing the complainant to be annoyed and alarmed, is facially sufficient with respect to a charge of aggravated harassment in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 240.30 [1]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Aggravated Harassment - Legitimate Communication </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. With respect to a charge of aggravated harassment in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 240.30 [2]), nonhearsay allegations that a defendant placed a phone call that threatened criminal behavior will suffice as prima facie evidence that defendant made a phone call with no purpose of legitimate communication.  Accordingly, an information that sets forth that defendant placed a phone call to the Child Abuse Reports Registry during which he told the complainant that he &quot;will start killing judges and some lawyers so that people will start to listen to the defendant, and that if [the complainant] doesn't take [the defendant's] report, that [the defendant] would start killing some people too, and that [the defendant] understands what the kids at Columbine High School were thinking before they did what they did,&quot; is facially sufficient with respect to a charge of aggravated harassment in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 240.30 [2]).  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 263.16, which proscribes possessing a sexual performance by a child, is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant, who was convicted after a jury trial of attempting to commit the crime because of nude photographs he took of his two minor daughters, ages five and seven, containing a &quot;lewd exhibition of the genitals.&quot; There was no impermissibly &quot;expansive construction&quot; of the statutory proscription to cover an innocent family photo or artistic depiction of a nude child.  Rather, the jury constitutionally applied the statute to defendant.  In each photograph, the focal point is the genitals of defendant's daughters. The setting in both photographs is sexually suggestive, in places or poses generally associated with sexual activity that are foreign to most children in the course of normal, benign activity.  Moreover, the conduct depicted in each photograph shows a sexual coyness, at a minimum, and even suggests a willingness to engage in sexual activity. Furthermore, it can be said that the conduct depicted in each photograph is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer. Accordingly, defendant's motion to set aside the jury's verdict pursuant to CPL 330.30 is denied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a criminal prosecution for harassment, defendant filed motions to dismiss, to compel a bill of particulars and discovery, to suppress statement evidence or, in the alternative, for a Huntley/Dunaway hearing, and to preclude the use of prior criminal history/bad acts at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with aggravated harassment in the second degree, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.30(1), and harassment in the second degree, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.26(3). Defendant moved, inter alia, to dismiss both counts as facially insufficient. Specifically, defendant sought dismissal of the count charging aggravated harassment on the ground that the statements alleged in the complaint did not constitute genuine threats. In addition, defendant sought dismissal of the count charging harassment on the ground that the complaint lacked factual allegations demonstrating a specific intent to harass. The court denied the motion to dismiss the count charging aggravated harassment because the court found the factual allegations provided reasonable cause to infer defendant acted with intent to harass when he communicated threats of physical violence by telephone. Additionally, the court denied the motion to dismiss the count charging harassment because there were specific threats to kill the complainant and put a bullet through her head. Thus, the court concluded it could infer from the threats that defendant intended to harass, annoy, or alarm the complainant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Aggravated Harassment - Threatening Telephone Calls - Intent to Harass </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a prosecution for aggravated harassment in the second degree, the factual allegations provide reasonable cause to infer that defendant acted with intent to harass, annoy or alarm the complainant when he communicated by telephone threats of physical violence which were likely to cause annoyance or alarm. The complaint alleges that more than one threatening phone call was made each day for a period of over two months.  The sheer number of calls standing alone provides a reasonable basis to infer that defendant intended to communicate with the complainant in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm. Moreover, the content of those communications includes unequivocal and specific threats of harm, which further evidence an intent to cause annoyance or alarm and which, despite the absence of a specific time and place for fulfillment of the threats, were statements likely to cause annoyance or alarm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Aggravated Harassment - Threatening Telephone Calls - Constitutionality </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Penal Law &sect; 240.30 (1), aggravated harassment in the second degree, is not constitutionally overbroad. While crude and vulgar outbursts which are not intended to, and do not, create a public disturbance may be protected from criminal prosecution as free speech, threats of physical violence, such as those communicated by defendant over the telephone, which are likely to cause alarm or annoyance to the recipient, enjoy no such constitutional protection. Constitutional free speech protections have never been thought to give absolute protection to every individual to speak whenever he pleases, or to use any form of address in any circumstances that he chooses; a person's right to free expression may be curtailed upon a showing that substantial privacy interests are being invaded in an essentially intolerable manner.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Harassment - Threatening Telephone Calls - Communication Lacking Any Legitimate Purpose </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Defendant's motion to dismiss a charge of harassment in the second degree is denied where the charge arose out of threatening telephone calls defendant made to the complainant concerning custody and/or visitation with his child.  The intent to harass, annoy or alarm may be inferred from the surrounding circumstances, and defendant made specific, unconditional threats to kill the complainant and to put a bullet through her head.  Thus, the court may infer from the threats alleged in the complaint that the defendant intended to harass, annoy or alarm the complainant.  While a telephone call to one's spouse to discuss the issue of child custody may well have a legitimate purpose, any attempt to resolve that issue by the making of threats of violence is not insulated from criminal sanction.  </SPAN></P>

The court held the statute was not unconstitutionally vague on its face in regard to its references to masquerade party or like entertainment because ordinary people did not have to guess at its meaning.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Penal Law &sect; 240.35 (4), which prohibits being masked or disguised in a public place while congregating with others who are also masked or disguised, does not unconstitutionally impede defendants' right to free association guaranteed by the First Amendment. The key to a successful First Amendment challenge to a disclosure requirement is undisputed evidence that establishes, as a matter of law, the requisite nexus between compelled disclosure of the identities of individuals and resulting recriminations from either Government officials or private parties.  Defendants, who describe themselves as anarchists and were arrested while participating in a May Day demonstration wearing bandanas covering their faces and shouting slogans like &quot;take back the streets&quot; and &quot;police state,&quot; have offered no evidence of a pattern of harassment against them.  The general knowledge that throughout history political dissidents often paid a heavy price for their unpopular beliefs is not a substitute for the necessary evidentiary showing.  Accordingly, there is no basis to conclude that if defendants are forced to uncover their faces they will be subject to harassment that will abridge their First Amendment right to associate for the promotion of their beliefs and ideas.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Loitering - Loitering while Masked or Disguised - Constitutionality of Penal Law &sect; 240.35 (4)&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Penal Law &sect; 240.35 (4), which prohibits being masked or disguised in a public place while congregating with others who are also masked or disguised, is not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. Although the statute contains an exemption for individuals attending a &quot;masquerade party or like entertainment&quot; if it is held in a city that has applicable regulations and a permit is obtained, it does not allow city officials unbridled discretion to decide whether an event is a masquerade party or like entertainment, and, therefore, lawful.  While the statute does not define &quot;masquerade party or like entertainment,&quot; the applicable test is whether the provision is so vague that people of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning.  &quot;Masquerade&quot; is defined as a social gathering of persons wearing masks and often fanciful costumes, and &quot;like entertainment&quot; refers to social gatherings, dances and performances that involve masks or costumes. These categories are specific and not drawn along content-related lines, thereby preventing an administrator from exercising unbridled discretion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Loitering - Loitering while Masked or Disguised - Constitutionality of Penal Law &sect; 240.35 (4)&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Penal Law &sect; 240.35 (4), which prohibits being masked or disguised in a public place while congregating with others who are also masked or disguised, is not unconstitutionally overbroad despite the fact that it prohibits masks which have expressive content, such as a gas mask worn to protest environmental degradation, as well as masks which provide anonymity as a corollary to the right to freedom of association.  Prohibiting the gathering of masked people in public is a proper exercise of the State's police power to prevent and detect crime.  An antimask law furthers the State's legitimate interest in protecting its citizens from intimidation, violence, and actual and implied threats, and these State interests are implicated even when masks are worn for anonymity or as symbolic expression, since any mask conceals the face of the wearer.  Although it is possible that the statute could be impermissibly applied to the wearing of masks for symbolic expression in nonexempt activities, these offensive applications are not so numerous as to produce a chilling effect on protected activity.  Moreover, the statute is capable of a reasonable limiting construction.  The original antimask law was enacted to prohibit wearing masks in order to prevent identification during lawless activity, and construing the law so as to prohibit the wearing of masks for no legitimate purpose is consistent with this purpose.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff insurance company sought restitution from defendant embezzler under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 213-b for payments it made to an insured pursuant to a policy covering losses arising out of employee infidelity. Plaintiff alleged that it took a full assignment of all the rights of action held by the insured including those under defendant's restitution agreement. Defendant moved to dismiss claiming the action was time-barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant embezzled $ 100,000 from his former employer, which was insured by plaintiff for such losses. Defendant pled guilty to grand larceny and was sentenced to five years probation. As a condition of probation, defendant was ordered to pay restitution to plaintiff's insured in the amount of $ 100,000. Defendant paid $ 50,000 immediately upon sentencing. Plaintiff sought payment for the remaining amount less the insured's deductible. The court held that plaintiff qualified as a &quot;crime victim&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 213-b because the statute was intended to be broadly construed and a similar restitution provision in the New York Penal Law had been interpreted to include insurance companies in the definition of &quot;crime victims.&quot; Therefore, plaintiff could rely on the seven year statute of limitations of &sect; 213-b, rather than the three year statute of limitations ordinarily applicable to claims sounding in conversion. However, neither plaintiff nor defendant offered proof of when the crime actually occurred so the court was unable to determine the date plaintiff's cause of action accrued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Motion was held in abeyance pending submission of proof as to when the crime occurred. Plaintiff was entitled to the benefit of the seven year statute of limitations to collect restitution because it qualified as a &quot;crime victim.&quot; The statute was intended to be interpreted broadly and insurers were &quot;crime victims&quot; under a similar statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limitation of Actions - What Statute Governs - Action by Victim of Criminal Offense - Insurance Company as Crime Victim </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Plaintiff, an insurance company that paid a claim made by an insured for a loss the insured sustained when defendant stole money from it, is a &quot;crime victim&quot; within the meaning of CPLR 213-b.  Accordingly, in its action to recover from defendant the money it paid out to its insured, plaintiff is entitled to rely on the seven-year Statute of Limitations of CPLR 213-b, rather than the three-year Statute of Limitations normally applicable to claims sounding in conversion. Although the statute does not define the term &quot;crime victim,&quot; its legislative history indicates a strong intent that the statute be broadly construed to compensate victims of crime. Moreover, the provisions of the Penal Law that provide for restitution to crime victims have consistently been applied to insurance companies.  </SPAN></P>

However, the court found the allegations in the complaint did not draw a sufficient connection between the governor and the alleged unconstitutional conduct of the State to conclude the governor was a real party in interest.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Plaintiff New York County Lawyers' Association (NYCLA) has third-party standing to challenge the monetary cap provisions of County Law &sect; 722-b and Judiciary Law &sect; 35 (3) for assigned private counsel. To maintain third-party standing a litigant must have direct standing and then the court must consider the relationship of the litigant to the person whose right it seeks to assert, the ability of the rightholder to vindicate his or her rights and the risk that the third-party rights will be adversely affected absent the litigation.  NYCLA satisfies the test for direct standing as it has suffered an injury in fact within the zone of interests protected by the statute, different from the public at large.  Third-party standing is also satisfied.  The third-party indigent clients' rights to assigned counsel are inextricably intertwined with NYCLA activities.  Thus, plaintiff is an effective proponent of the clients' rights.  Moreover, the third parties would not be able to assert their own rights because of the magnitude of the litigation and the lack of resources available to them.  Furthermore, the substantial empirical evidence provides strong indication that the third parties' rights and interests will be protected by this litigation.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Plaintiff New York County Lawyers' Association (NYCLA) has organizational standing to challenge the monetary cap provisions of County Law &sect; 722-b and Judiciary Law &sect; 35 (3) for assigned private counsel. To maintain organizational standing the organization must have direct standing, some or all of its members must have direct standing to sue, the interests it asserts must be germane to its purposes, and neither the asserted claim nor the appropriate relief may require participation of the individual members.  NYCLA has direct standing as it has suffered an injury in fact within the zone of interests protected by the statute, different from the public at large.  NYCLA's members fall within the zone of interests of the statutes and related court rules, and thus have direct standing to sue.  In addition, the NYCLA members' injury is different from the public at large because they are an advocate class enlisted to defend the indigents. Moreover, the interests NYCLA seeks to protect are germane to its organizational purpose and the panel members' participation is not necessary.  </SPAN></P>

NYCLA claims that failure to provide sufficient compensation to private counsel has resulted in deficiencies in the assigned counsel system and a risk that indigents will be denied their rights to effective assistance of counsel and due process of law.  In support of these claims plaintiff has submitted empirical evidence detailing the current crisis in the assigned counsel program, official statistics, reports from independent groups, and other material which outlines the shortage of active panel attorneys and how they are overburdened.  The submissions also show the adverse effects on juvenile delinquency cases, abuse and neglect proceedings, appellate backlogs, arraignment overload, the problem of uncertified panel counsel, prolonged delays, and how it relates to the current 18-B compensation rates.  </SPAN></P>

A tortious interference with contract claim against the State by the New York County Lawyers' Association (NYCLA) in its challenge of the monetary cap provisions of County Law &sect; 722-b and Judiciary Law &sect; 35 (3) for assigned private counsel is dismissed.  A prima facie case for tortious interference requires the existence of a contract, defendant's awareness of the contract, defendant's intentional inducement of the contract's breach, actual breach, and damages.  There is no contractual relationship between the City of New York and NYCLA, of which the State would be considered an interfering third party, as the relationship is not one rooted in a pecuniary interest.  A binding contract requires mutuality of consideration.  There was no bargained-for exchange between the parties here.  NYCLA's assumed duties, codified in the court rules, do not create a contract within the meaning of tortious interference, and in the absence of a contractual relationship there can be no breach.  </SPAN></P>

This area clearly was not a place to which the public or a substantial group of persons had access. Further it was not any of the specific places enumerated in &sect; 240.35(2). Moreover, to charge defendant with loitering did not further the general rationale of the loitering statutes which was to prevent minor offenses in places frequented by the public for the protection of the public. The conduct did not occur in a public place. Therefore, the charge of loitering in violation of &sect; 240.35(2) had to be dismissed because the statute did not apply to defendant's alleged conduct. The allegations of the accusatory instrument were insufficient to show that defendant was loitering for the purpose of using or possessing drugs. The fact that four baggies were found on the ground where five men were standing did not establish defendant's purpose in being on that property was to use or possess drugs.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a prosecution wherein it is alleged that defendant was gambling with dice on a driveway in the rear yard of a private residence, the charge of loitering in a public place for the purposes of gambling in violation of Penal Law &sect; 240.35 (2) is dismissed on the ground that the driveway is not a public place within the meaning of the statute.  The driveway is not a place to which the public or a substantial group of persons has access, and it is not any of the specific places enumerated in Penal Law &sect; 240.00 (1), which defines the term &quot;public place&quot; for purposes of Penal Law article 240.  Moreover, to charge defendant with loitering for his alleged conduct under these circumstances does not further the general rationale of the loitering statutes, which is to prevent minor offenses in places frequented by the public for the protection of the public.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Loitering - Loitering in Public Place for Purposes of Gambling - Unconstitutionality of Statute&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Penal Law &sect; 240.35 (2), which provides that a person is guilty of loitering when he or she loiters or remains in a public place for the purpose of gambling with cards, dice or other gambling paraphernalia, is unconstitutional.  Gambling is illegal only if a person advances or profits from the gambling activity when acting other than as a player. Therefore, a person who gambles with dice as a casual player does not commit a crime, and a person who loiters for that purpose cannot engage in criminal behavior. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Loitering - Sufficiency of Accusatory Instrument </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In a loitering prosecution wherein it is alleged that defendant and four other men were gambling with dice on the driveway in the rear yard of a private residence and four baggies containing cocaine were found on the ground in the area where the men were standing, the charge of first degree loitering in violation of Penal Law &sect; 240.36 is dismissed on the ground that the allegations of the accusatory instrument are insufficient to show that defendant was loitering for the purposes of using or possessing a controlled substance. The mere presence of the baggies in the area cannot create a presumption that illicit drug use or possession was the reason why defendant was present.  The accusatory instrument contains no allegation of use or possession of illicit drugs by defendant or any of the codefendants; the only conduct observed was gambling with dice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Loitering - &quot;Any Place&quot; - Driveway in Rear Yard of Private Residence is Not Any Place </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In a prosecution wherein it is alleged that four baggies containing cocaine were found on the ground in the immediate vicinity of defendant and four other men as they stood in the driveway in the rear yard of a private residence, the charge of first degree loitering in violation of Penal Law &sect; 240.36, which prohibits loitering or remaining in &quot;any place&quot; for the purposes of unlawfully using or possessing a controlled substance, is dismissed on the ground that the driveway is not &quot;any place&quot; within the meaning of the statute.  The actions forming the basis of the charge took place on private property, albeit not inside the residence.  To accept an expansive view of the term &quot;any place&quot; and apply the statute to private property does not serve either of the fundamental purposes of loitering statutes, which are to insulate members of the public from injury to their person or property and materially assist the police in maintaining the peace.  It would, however, invite questionable intrusions into personal privacy and make the law an instrument of harassment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs filed suit alleging the State's funding mechanisms (1) caused New York City public school students to receive less than the sound basic education required by the New York State Constitution Education Article, N.Y. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1, and (2) had an adverse and disparate impact upon minority public school students in violation of implementing regulations promulgated under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000d of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, students, parents, and organizations concerned with education issues, challenged New York State's funding of New York City's public schools. Plaintiffs alleged (1) the State had failed to assure New York City's public schools received adequate funding to afford their students the sound basic education guaranteed by the Education Article of the New York State Constitution, N.Y. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1, and (2) the State's funding mechanisms had an adverse and disparate impact on the city's minority public school students in violation of specific implementing regulations of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000d of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The court found the education provided New York City students was so deficient that it fell below the constitutional floor set by the Education Article of the New York State Constitution and the State's actions were a substantial cause of this constitutional violation. With respect to the claim under Title VI's implementing regulations, the court found that the state school funding system had an adverse and disparate impact on minority public school children and this disparate impact was not adequately justified by any educational reason.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">It was determined that the New York Legislature had to take steps to reform the state educational system. Ordered that the State put in place reforms of school financing and governance designed to redress constitutional and regulatory violations. The court retained jurisdiction for as long as necessary to ensure that the constitutional and statutory/regulatory violations were corrected.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - State Aid to School Districts - Constitutionality of State's Public School Financing System </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. New York State's public school financing system violates the Education Article of the New York Constitution (NY Const, art XI, &sect; 1), since New York City public school students are not provided the opportunity to receive a sound basic education, and there is a causal link between this failure and the State's system for funding public schools. A sound basic education consists of the foundational skills that students need to become productive citizens capable of civil engagement and sustaining competitive employment.  A sound basic education is gauged by the resources afforded students (inputs) and by students' performance (outputs).  Regarding inputs, defendants have failed to provide minimally adequate teaching of reasonably up-to-date basic curricula by sufficient personnel adequately trained to teach those subjects.  Also, defendants have failed to provide minimally adequate physical facilities and classrooms. Furthermore, defendants have failed to provide adequate instrumentalities of learning. Regarding outputs, the City public school students' graduation/dropout rates and performance on standardized tests demonstrate that they are not receiving a minimally adequate education.  Increased funding can provide the City with better teachers, better school buildings and better instrumentalities of learning. Thus, there is a causal link between the current funding system and the students' poor performance.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - State Aid to School Districts - Discrimination Cause of Action under Title VI of Civil Rights Act </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. New York State's public school financing system has an adverse and disparate impact on minority New York City public school children which is not adequately justified by any reason related to education, and thus violates title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC &sect; 2000d). 42 USC &sect; 2000d-1 authorizes Federal agencies to promulgate rules and regulations to effectuate its provisions.  Plaintiffs' claim arises from 34 CFR 100.3 (b) (2), which provides that recipients of Federal funding may not utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination, or the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program.  To prevail on this claim, plaintiffs must prove that a facially neutral practice has had an adverse and disparate impact upon a protected class of people.  If plaintiffs meet that burden, then defendants must demonstrate that the challenged practice is justified by educational necessity.  From 1994-1995 to 1999-2000, New York City has consistently received less total State aid than its percentage share of enrolled students.  Seventy-three percent of the State's minority public school students are enrolled in the City's public schools; minority students make up approximately 84% of the City's public school enrollment; and the City receives less funding per capita, on average, than districts in the rest of the State.  Money is a crucial determinant of educational quality, and receipt of less educational funding by minority students is an adverse disparate impact within the purview of the regulations.  Thus, plaintiffs have proved that the State's school funding mechanism caused the alleged disparate impact.  Defendants' justifications for the adverse disparate racial impact caused by the distribution of State aid are unpersuasive.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a telemarketer, was accused of two counts of aggravated harassment in the second degree, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect;240.30(1). Defendant sought an order dismissing the accusatory instrument against him as being insufficient on its face, on grounds that the allegations of offenses charged did not constitute a violation of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant made two separate telemarketing calls to each complainant, and when his services were declined, he called each one a &quot;dumb nigger&quot; and hung up. Defendant claimed his comments constituted protected speech under U.S. Const. amend. I. The court agreed. The expression of controversial and unpopular views was precisely what the state and federal constitutions protected. The mere fact that defendant, in anger and frustration, used colorful language in registering displeasure with complainants' refusal to purchase his services did not render the communication criminal within the ambit of the N.Y. Penal Law &sect;240.30(1). Defendant's statement, under the circumstances alleged, did not constitute fighting words or obscenity, and therefore was protected by the principle of freedom of speech guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. I and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dismissed the accusatory instruments. Under the circumstances alleged, defendant's words were not used with the intent to provoke a reasonable person into an immediate and violent breach of the peace, as required for defendant to be convicted under the aggravated harassment statute. His speech was therefore protected by the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Aggravated Harassment - Protected Speech </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a prosecution for aggravated harassment in violation of Penal Law &sect; 240.30 (1) where it is alleged that defendant telemarketer called complainants one time each for the purpose of selling home improvement items to them, and, when such services were declined, called both a &quot;dumb nigger,&quot; defendant's motion to dismiss the information for insufficiency is granted.  The words &quot;dumb nigger,&quot; though reprehensible, improper and uncalled for, do not rise to the level of aggravated harassment as defined by Penal Law &sect; 240.30 (1).  They are not legally obscene or &quot;fighting words,&quot; and constitute protected speech under the Federal and State Constitutions.  Moreover, criminal liability may be imposed for making a single telephone call only if the call is placed with the requisite intent to harass, annoy, threaten or alarm, and there is a lack of legitimate purpose for the call in the first instance.  Here, the calls were not initiated for the purpose of harassment, annoyance, threats or alarm, but rather for the legitimate purpose of soliciting business.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, charged with a capital crime in which the State had filed a death penalty notice, challenged New York's procedure, set forth at N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 270.20(1)(f), for death-qualifying jurors as violating his rights to an impartial jury, to due process, and to a jury composed of a cross-section of the community. He argued that the provision permitting a challenge for cause only where a juror's views would actually preclude him from rendering an impartial verdict or properly exercising discretion in determining a sentence could only be applied constitutionally to the prosecution. The court declined to modify previous rulings that the statute was constitutional. People with reservations about the death penalty did not constitute a constitutionally cognizable group, because they did not necessarily have much in common. New York's scheme was crafted to meet federal constitutional requirements, and therefore properly limited juries in the exercise of their discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court upheld the death penalty notice, because it found nothing in defendant's arguments to persuade it to abandon previous determinations that the statute was constitutional.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Jurors with religious or conscientious qualms about capital punishment do not constitute a cognizable and distinct group warranting protection from discrimination.  A cognizable group is one that is a recognizable, distinct class, singled out for different treatment under the laws, as written or applied.  The group must be defined by a limiting factor, by a common thread of attitude or experience, and by a community of interests that cannot be represented if the group is excluded from the jury selection process. There are no such characteristics among individuals expressing qualms about capital punishment. A shared attitude of conscientious objection to the death penalty is insufficient alone to create the kernel of a cognizable group. No common limiting factor has been shown to unify such individuals into a group, nor has any societal discrimination against such a group been demonstrated.  Moreover, their exclusion from jury service in a capital case is not arbitrary, but is designed to further the State's interest in obtaining a single, impartial jury. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a restaurant and catering facility. The defendant was alleged to have failed and refused to pay for 15 days worth of deliveries made by the plaintiff to the defendant's facility, with each delivery invoiced separately. The total amount due and owing is between $ 10,000-15,000. Plaintiff filed claims in the Commercial Claims Division of the District Court, assembling the invoices into four groups, the total of each was just under the statutory limit for Small and Commercial Claims. Defendant moved to consolidate the claims and dismiss for want of jurisdiction. Before the court, the issue was whether the monetary jurisdictional limit for Small and Commercial Claims was applicable to the total sought in a plaintiff's complaint, or whether it was applicable only to individual causes of action. The trial court found that under current caselaw decisions and statutory interpretation, the Commercial Claims jurisdiction of the District Court was determined whether or not the total sought, in the aggregate, exceeded the jurisdictional limit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's motion was denied in its entirety because current caselaw suggested that even in the aggregate, as long as an individual claim met the jurisdictional limits of the District Court, the court could hear any claim.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The $ 3,000 monetary jurisdictional limit for small and commercial claims brought in the Nassau County District Court (UDCA 1801, 1801-A) is applicable only to individual causes of action and should not be applied to the total sought in the complaint, even where the separate claims are consolidated for joint trial pursuant to CPLR 602.  UDCA 211 allows the court to exercise jurisdiction where a single complaint contains separately stated and distinct causes of action and the aggregate demand exceeds the court's monetary jurisdiction so long as the demand of each individual separately stated cause of action does not exceed the monetary jurisdictional limit (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see also,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CCA 211; UCCA 211; UJCA 211).  Consequently, the District Court has jurisdiction over plaintiff's four separate claims to recover monetary damages for 15 days' worth of deliveries of fresh produce to defendant's restaurant and catering facility where the total amount due and owing is between $ 10,000 and $ 15,000 but where each separate claim is under the court's monetary limit for commercial claims.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, public advocate of the City of New York, applied, pursuant to New York City, N.Y., Charter &sect; 1109, for a summary judicial inquiry into the actions taken and public statements made by respondent, New York City's mayor, following certain statements made by respondent mayor concerning a decedent's juvenile and criminal record which had been sealed by the court. The decedent was shot and killed by a New York City police officer. Petitioner alleged that the public disclosure of the decedent's juvenile and criminal record was unauthorized. On that basis, petitioner sought an inquiry into how respondent obtained the information which he made public, whether the information was from sealed records, and whether its release was made without regard to the statutory protection of such records. Respondent contended that New York City, N.Y., Charter &sect; 1109 improperly violated the separation of powers doctrine. The trial court found that the legislative intent clearly authorized such inquiries. As such, petitioner's application was granted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. New York City Charter &sect; 1109, which permits the Public Advocate of New York City to seek from the courts an order to conduct a summary inquiry into alleged violations of duty in relation to the property, government or affairs of New York City, does not improperly assign a public trust role to a Supreme Court Justice in violation of New York Constitution, article VI, &sect; 20, and thus is facially constitutional.  The function and purpose of a Supreme Court Justice in presiding over a summary inquiry resulting in a report by the Public Advocate is a judicial function comparable to that of a Justice presiding over a Grand Jury investigation and report pursuant to CPL 190.85.  The function is also consistent with the variety of traditionally permissible judicial roles.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Summary Inquiry by Public Advocate </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. New York City Charter &sect; 1109, which permits the Public Advocate of New York City to seek from the courts an order to conduct a summary inquiry into alleged violations of duty in relation to the property, government or affairs of New York City, is not unconstitutional as applied to the Public Advocate's inquiry into actions taken and public statements made by the Mayor which allegedly involved information obtained from court-sealed records of an individual shot by a New York City police officer. The summary inquiry is sought with respect to allegations of specific misconduct in relation to specific statutory provisions.  Access to sealed records is carefully regulated by statute.  The Public Advocate seeks to discover answers to specific questions regarding the sources of the statement and how the sources were obtained.  These questions are focused on the facts underlying the Public Advocate's allegation that in publicizing the victim's criminal and juvenile records, the Mayor disregarded specific provisions and requirements of the CPL and Family Court Act governing access to, and dissemination of, the content of such records.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Officers - Public Advocate - Inquiry into Mayor's Activities in Obtaining Information from Sealed Records </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. The Public Advocate's request, pursuant to New York City Charter &sect; 1109, for an inquiry into actions taken and public statements made by the Mayor, which allegedly involved information obtained from court-sealed records of an individual shot by a New York City police officer, is not beyond the scope of the statute.  Although inquiries into financial corruption may have been a primary reason for enacting the summary inquiry provision, the language of the current section 1109 broadly applies to all forms of official misconduct and encompasses the unauthorized release of the contents of sealed court records.  The sealing requirements which are the focus of the Public Advocate's petition are an important part of the juvenile and criminal justice systems.  Regardless of whether the confidentiality of these records continues after the death of their subject, the unsealing of the records is not self-executing.  The ability and willingness of the Mayor, in concert with executive agencies serving under his aegis, to bypass the sealing safeguards, to ignore the procedures for judicial unsealing, and to disseminate information contained in sealed records at will, present a question as to the functioning of municipal government of sufficient importance to warrant a summary inquiry.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs were disadvantaged and minority students in defendants, city school district (RCSD) and state. Defendants included suburban districts. Plaintiffs' proposed class action claimed violations of N.Y. Const. art. XI , &sect;1, education article; N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, equal protection; 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983; and regulations implementing &sect; 1983. Plaintiffs asked the court to order a state remedial plan. Defendants moved to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs presented statistics to support their claim that the combination of poverty and racial isolation made it was impossible for students to receive a sound basic education as required in N.Y. Const. art. XI , &sect; 1, and sought a declaration that the inferior education provided to minority students in defendant RCSD violated N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and its regulations. The statistics included a high concentration of minority, poor, and low scores. Section 1 required defendant state to offer all children the opportunity of a sound basic education, and did not require substantially equal facilities. Problematic was where the inequalities existing in cities were the product of demographic, economic, and political factors intrinsic to the cities themselves, and could not be attributed to legislative action or inaction. The court gave plaintiffs time to try to meet their difficult burden to overcome defendant state's legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons, to show that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect;3202 and N.Y. Unconsol. Laws &sect; 6265(5), related to low-income housing concentrations in cities, and other specific acts, violated &sect; 11 and &sect; 1983 and its regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Court granted defendant RCSD's and defendant suburban district's motion, because, although they were necessary parties, no remedies were sought. Court granted defendant state's motion to dismiss education article claims because no constitutional claim of failure to provide for the maintenance and support of a system of free public education was made by merely claiming failed academic results, but not defendant state's remaining claims.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Education Article - Providing Opportunity for Sound Basic Education - Failed Academic Results </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Plaintiffs' allegations that the combination of poverty and racial isolation in the Rochester City School District (RCSD), caused by the State's role in fostering and failing to address racial and economic isolation between the RCSD and other districts in Monroe County, has resulted in poor academic outcomes of the children in RCSD, fail to state a violation of the Education Article of the New York Constitution (NY Const, art XI, &sect; 1), which requires the State to offer all children the opportunity of a sound basic education.  The failed academic results of the RCSD alone vis-a-vis the achievement of the other Monroe County schools are not sufficient to establish the predicate for a constitutional violation. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' cause of action alleging that the State's failure to address racial and economic isolation of minority students in the Rochester City School District violates the implementing regulations (34 CFR 100.3 [b] [3]) under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC &sect; 2000d) is denied.  A validly stated cause of action under the title VI regulations includes whether a challenged practice has a sufficiently adverse racial impact and, if so, whether the practice is nevertheless justified.  Plaintiffs have presumptively established that the combined effect of Education Law &sect; 3202 and McKinney's Unconsolidated Laws of NY &sect; 6265 (5) (New York State Urban Development Corporation Act &sect; 15; L 1968, ch 174, &sect; 1, as amended), which cause plaintiffs to remain in the Rochester City School Districts with a high poverty concentration, has an adverse discriminatory impact on African-American and Latino students, and thus the State.  The State has presumptively defended the challenged statutes by way of legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons.  Should section 6265 (5) prove to be discriminatory and not justified or necessary, the articulation of less discriminatory alternative remedies may be deferred.  However, should the plaintiffs fail in their proof of discrimination, they will have to set forth their less discriminatory alternatives.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a proceeding in which the paternal grandparent of a child whose father died seeks visitation with that child, the motion of the child's natural mother to dismiss the petition is denied.  Although the United States Supreme Court has held that a statute granting visitation rights to a broad category of nonparents violated a parent's substantive due process right to make decisions about the care, custody and control of the child (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Troxel v Granville,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 530 US 57), Domestic Relations Law &sect; 72, which prescribes the circumstances under which nonparental visitation shall be permitted, is far more circumspect and involves a two-step process: equitable circumstances must exist or one of the parents must be deceased, and nonparental visitation, limited to the grandparents, must be in the child's best interests.  While parents have a fundamental right to autonomy in child rearing, that right is neither unfettered nor absolute: in an appropriate case, the best interests of the child may take precedence. The fact that a grandparent action may be the mechanism triggering the assertion of the child's best interests does not automatically give rise to a declaration of infirmity of the parent's constitutional rights. Although the presumption of parental decision making as being appropriate in the first instance is not statutorily present in New York, nonetheless, by imposing the burden of proof upon the petitioning grandparents, the parental decision has been given some presumptive weight.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff instituted a declaratory judgment action in the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York) seeking to have N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the district attorney submitted his resignation, plaintiff instituted a declaratory judgment action seeking to have N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect; 42(1) declared unconstitutional and in violation of N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. Plaintiff further argued that by requiring the vacancy to be filled at the next general election, he was deprived of his right to participate in a primary election. However, the fact that the election was to be held without the possibility of a primary was the result of the operation of N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 6-116. In providing that the party nomination of a candidate was to be made by a county committee of the party, N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 6-116, not N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect; 42(1), precluded a primary election in the circumstances at issue.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections - Primary Elections - Absence of Primary Election When Filling Certain Vacancies </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Public Officers Law &sect; 42 (1), which provides that a vacancy occurring before September 20 in an office authorized to be filled at a general election shall be filled at the next general election, does not violate plaintiff's right to participate in a primary election (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art I, &sect; 1).  Section 42 does not provide that a primary election will not be held where a vacancy occurs before September 20; rather, that section only provides that the vacancy be filled at the next general election. That the election is held without the possibility of a primary is the result of the operation of Election Law &sect; 6-116, which provides that the party nomination of a candidate is to be made by a county committee of the party.  Accordingly, Election Law &sect; 6-116, not Public Officers Law &sect; 42 (1), precludes a primary election where an elective public office holder resigns his office effective September 19.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections - Primary Elections - Absence of Primary Election When Filling Certain Vacancies </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The scheme chosen by the Legislature for filling a vacancy in an elective public office which occurs after seven days before the last day for circulating designating petitions, or after the holding of the meeting or convention to nominate or designate candidates for such office, is reasonable even though it precludes holding a primary election. Where a District Attorney resigns his office one day before the date on which Public Officers Law &sect; 42 (1) calls for such vacancy to be filled at the next general election, the vacancy could only be filled by an appointed officer through December 31 following the general election. If the office was not filled at the general election, the office would again be vacant after December 31.  The scheme devised by the Legislature with respect to vacancies in the office of District Attorney includes limited appointed terms and special elections, all the while pointing to have the vacancy permanently filled in the next general election. In enacting Public Officers Law &sect; 42 and Election Law &sect; 6-116 the Legislature opted to continue the pattern of filling vacancies at the next general election, even in circumstances where it occurred too late to allow for a primary election. Given the prudent constitutional limitation on appointments to fill vacancies and the obligation to fill vacancies, the legislative determination to fill vacancies in offices at the next general election, even in circumstances which would then preclude a primary, is reasonable.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In filling a vacancy created by the resignation of a District Attorney on the last day that the law requires such vacancy to be filled at the next general election, i.e., too late for a primary contest to be held, the term of the successful candidate at that election is not limited to the one-year balance of the unexpired term of the former District Attorney, since such a limitation is nothing more than an attempt to impose a judgment that forgoing a primary election for one year represents the extent of a reasonable limitation on the Legislature's authority to determine the manner in which such vacancies are filled. Moreover, such a limitation contravenes New York Constitution, article XIII, &sect; 13 (a), which provides for a District Attorney to be chosen by the electors once in every three or four years as directed by the Legislature, and which has been interpreted to provide for election to a full term when filling a vacancy in that office.  </SPAN></P>

The New York statute allowed only grandparents to petition for visitation rights, compared with the Washington statute struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court, which allowed &quot;any person&quot; to seek visitation. The court herein was of the opinion that the investiture of visitation rights in a party would seem to intrude and actually intrude more severely upon parental autonomy, than does setting a schedule of visitation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed motions under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;&sect;440.10(1)(h), 440.20 for a new trial and to vacate his sentence after his conviction for sale of a controlled substance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty in federal court to a drug crime, but this conviction was reversed because of a failure to suppress evidence obtained in violation of his U.S. Const. amend. IV rights. In defendant's state trial for selling cocaine, the court ruled that defendant's federal conviction, although on appeal, could be used for impeachment if he testified. He chose not to testify, and was convicted. The court considered his federal conviction, but not the underlying facts of the case, in imposing sentence. After the federal conviction was reversed, defendant moved for a new trial under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;440.10(1)(h), and vacation of sentence under &sect; 440.20. A new trial was denied. Use of the unconstitutionally obtained conviction to impeach would have been error, and under New York law, that the defendant did not testify did not preclude him from raising this issue. The error was harmless, however, as evidence of guilt was overwhelming. The sentence, imposed after the court considered the subsequently reversed conviction, was vacated as a violation of defendant's due process rights. On resentencing, the facts underlying the federal case, if reliable, could be considered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Motion for a new trial denied, because giving the State leave to use a conviction (which was later reversed) to impeach defendant if he testified was harmless error; motion to vacate sentence granted, because use of the same conviction in sentencing was reversible error.</SPAN></P>

Once a conviction is voided on any constitutional ground, fundamental fairness precludes a sentence from standing where a court has considered the existence of the voided conviction to enhance punishment, whether under a recidivist statute or for purposes of increasing punishment within a statutory range.  Where materially untrue assumptions or misinformation are presented to a court at sentencing, due process is violated and resentencing is required.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff filed a motion for a default judgment pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3215 because defendant failed to submit an answer to plaintiff's complaint alleging that defendant breached his agreement with the nursing home to pay over to plaintiff his Social Security Administration income and requesting specific performance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was admitted to plaintiff's nursing home. Defendant signed an agreement authorizing assignment of Medicaid payments to plaintiff. Although Social Security payments were received by defendant, he failed to make any contributions to plaintiff for his own care. As a result, plaintiff filed suit against defendant. Defendant failed to submit an answer to the complaint, and plaintiff made a motion for a default judgment. Plaintiff sought a court order directing that defendant turn over future Social Security payments. The court concluded that any order granting plaintiff's application would have constituted a violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 407(a) because any court order would have become a legal process of the court, which was prohibited by &sect; 407(a). Accordingly, the court declined to grant a default judgment in plaintiff's first cause of action. However, &sect; 407(a) did not relieve defendant of his obligation to make payment for the uncovered costs of his care and treatment, but only protected Social Security benefits from the claims of creditors. Thus, plaintiff was to submit the exact amount owed before the court entered a default judgment on plaintiff's second cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Default judgment was denied on plaintiff's first cause of action because Social Security Act (Act) protected Social Security benefits from the claims of creditors. However, the court would have entered default judgment on plaintiff's second cause of action, when amount owed was determined, because Act did not relieve defendant of his obligation to make payments for uncovered costs of his care and treatment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health - Nursing Homes - No Right to Resident's Future Social Security Payments </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A nursing home is not entitled to specific performance of an agreement requiring a resident who requires 24-hour skilled care to turn over his Social Security payments in satisfaction of the charges he is incurring, since 42 USC &sect; 407 (a) prohibits such payments from being subject to &quot;execution, levy ... or other legal process.&quot; Although the pending case involves private contractual rights, not a State statute or regulation, the express language of the statute prevents any transfer or assignment of future payments, whether by actions at law or in equity, and without regard to the nature of the creditor.  Any order granting plaintiff's application would constitute a violation of the statute, since plaintiff, by commencing this action, has invoked the jurisdiction of the State courts, and the current motion requests judicial relief. If the application were granted, an order, which would become a &quot;legal process&quot; of the court, would be issued directing defendant to turn over future Social Security benefits.  Moreover, it is not altogether clear that there was an agreement by defendant to include Social Security benefits as part of his personal financial resources, which were to be contributed for his care.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant moved to preclude the People from reducing his charges from class A misdemeanors to class B misdemeanors or, in the alternative, to grant defendant a jury trial on the reduced charges, claiming the reduction on the eve of trial denied his U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arraigned on a felony complaint and charged with two counts of assault, menacing, weapon possession and harassment. The felony assault charge was dismissed. Later, the People further reduced the class A misdemeanors to class B misdemeanors.

The reduction of assault to attempted assault was not so inherently different as to alter the defense strategy. There was no showing of vindictiveness as ample time was left for defendant to prepare for trial. Defendant was not entitled to a jury trial where the maximum length of incarceration was less than six months.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The motion was denied because the reduction of the charges did not deprive defendant of his constitutional right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Right to Jury Trial - Prosecutor's Power to Reduce Charges on Eve of Trial </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The reduction of the charges against defendant on the eve of trial from class A misdemeanors to class B attempt misdemeanors punishable by up to 90 days in jail, thereby depriving defendant of a jury trial pursuant to CPL 340.40 (2), does not constitute an abuse of prosecutorial privilege where the People left ample time before trial for the defense to prepare a proper defense strategy, and did not otherwise attempt to hide the true nature of the charges from the defense.  The attempt charges pursuant to Penal Law &sect; 110.00 were not mere &quot;hypothetical crimes&quot; which were impossible for defendant to have committed.  Furthermore, the mere act of reducing a charge from an A misdemeanor to a B misdemeanor does not in and of itself constitute prejudice to defendant with regard to the denial of a jury trial since that right arises from, and depends upon, the potential punishment after conviction.  A defendant facing a maximum penalty of 90 days' imprisonment has no constitutional right to a jury trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Right to Jury Trial - Constitutionality of Denial of Jury Trials to Persons within New York City Charged with Petty Offenses </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant is not entitled to a jury trial in the New York City Criminal Court where the People reduced the charges against him on the eve of trial from class A misdemeanors to class B attempt misdemeanors punishable by up to 90 days in jail.  CPL 340.40 (2), which denies the right to a jury trial to persons charged with certain misdemeanor crimes in the City of New York &quot;for which the authorized term of imprisonment is not more than six months,&quot; while according the right to a jury trial to those charged with similar crimes outside the City of New York, does not deny equal protection of the law to defendants charged with petty offenses living within the City of New York.  The People have demonstrated a compelling State interest that would necessitate a disparity in the right to a jury trial in cases tried in the already overcrowded New York City court system.  The denial of jury trials to persons within New York City charged with petty offenses with a maximum incarceration period of six months or less is a necessary means toward achieving the compelling State interest of eliminating unmanageable court congestion. Furthermore, persons charged with petty offenses have no constitutional right to a jury trial. Moreover, defendant's exposure to incarceration has been lessened by allowing the People to reduce the charges to B misdemeanors. Consequently, defendant has not been denied his constitutional right to a jury trial. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent filed a motion seeking a declaration that Kendra's Law, N.Y. Mental Hyg.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners argued that Kendra's Law did not abridge a patient's fundamental right to make his own treatment decisions since there was no forcible administration of medication, that the purpose of the statute was remedial, not punitive, and that a patient's failure to comply with the court-ordered treatment plan resulted only in heightened scrutiny by a physician to ensure that the patient received treatment. The court determined that &sect; 9.60 was constitutional and denied the motion. Section 9.60 did not violate respondent's due process rights because a patient who was subject to an Assisted Outpatient Treatment order had already been adjudicated a danger to self or others for failing to comply with treatment, and the 72 hour evaluation was a reasonable countermeasure under the State's parens patriae and police powers. Section 9.60 did not violate respondent's equal protection rights because the State had a compelling interest in taking measures to prevent patients who posed a high risk from becoming a danger to the community and to themselves, and &sect; 9.60 was narrowly tailored to achieve those goals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Motion denied because patients subject to an Assisted Outpatient Treatment order under the statute had already been adjudicated as dangerous and the 72 hour evaluation was reasonable, and because the State had a compelling interest to prevent high-risk patients from becoming dangerous and the statute was narrowly tailored to do so.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mental Health - Assisted Outpatient Treatment - Constitutionality of Kendra's Law </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kendra's Law (Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 9.60), which, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> authorizes a court to order certain mentally ill persons with a history of lack of compliance with medical treatment to follow a specified assisted outpatient treatment plan, does not unconstitutionally violate a patient's fundamental right to make his or her own medical treatment decisions, or result in a violation of equal protection because of the absence of a requirement that the patient be found to lack the capacity to make a reasoned treatment decision before an assisted outpatient treatment order can be granted.  The object of Kendra's Law is to ensure that these patients retain their capacity, do not relapse or deteriorate, and do not become a danger to themselves or others.  The statute provides that the physician who is advocating for an assisted outpatient treatment plan must provide the patient, the treating physician and, upon the patient's request, &quot;an individual significant to the patient&quot; with an &quot;opportunity to actively participate in the development of such plan.&quot; Furthermore, an assisted outpatient treatment order does not unreasonably violate the patient's right to refuse medication by threatening arrest upon noncompliance with the court-ordered plan.  Rather, the patient's failure to comply with the treatment plan leads to the heightened scrutiny of physicians for a 72-hour evaluation period, but only after a physician has determined that the patient may be in need of involuntary admission to a hospital.  This is a reasonable response to a patient's failure to comply with treatment when it is balanced against the compelling State interest in taking measures to prevent high-risk patients from becoming a danger to the community and themselves.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners alleged that they had a close relationship with their granddaughter since her birth, that she and respondent lived with them in their household until she was two-and-one-half years old, that they saw her on an almost daily basis after that until she was four, and that they continued to see her frequently, including baby sitting for her two days per week, until all contact with her was cut off by respondent after a family dispute. Petitioners argued it would be in their granddaughter's best interest for them to continue to have contact with her. Respondent's motion to dismiss the petition was denied without prejudice on grounds a hearing needed to be held to determine whether petitioners had standing to proceed under N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 72, and if so, whether visitation should be granted, in light of the presumptive weight to be afforded to parental decision-making. At the hearing, if respondent's objection to petitioners' visitation was found not to be related to the child's best interest, then the court would have considerably greater leeway to determine whether visitation should be granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent's motion to dismiss was denied so that the court could hold a hearing to address, inter alia, whether petitioners had engaged in conduct which would justify denial of visitation, whether respondent's stated reasons for denying visitation were related to child's best interest, and whether denial of visitation would have any harmful effect on the child.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parent and Child - Visitation Rights of Grandparents </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Domestic Relations Law &sect; 72, which grants standing to grandparents to petition for visitation where one or both parents are deceased or where &quot;equity sees fit to intervene,&quot; and provides that the ultimate decision to allow visitation be based on the best interest of the child, has not been rendered unconstitutional on its face by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Troxel v Granville</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (530 US 57, 120 S Ct 2054). There, the Supreme Court held that a State statute governing nonparental visitation, as applied to the facts of the case, unconstitutionally infringed on the mother's fundamental parental rights to make decisions concerning the care, custody and control of her children, and that a State court may not usurp a fit parent's authority to make child-rearing decisions.  The New York statute has been interpreted to require substantial deference to the authority of parents in determining whether grandparent visitation is in the best interests of the child.  Only after standing is conferred does the court have authority to determine whether grandparent visitation is in the child's best interest. Accordingly, the petition by the maternal grandparents seeking visitation with their grandchild should not be dismissed at this juncture.  There are factual issues to be decided before it can be determined whether petitioners have standing under Domestic Relations Law &sect; 72, and, if so, whether visitation should be granted in light of the presumptive weight to be accorded to parental decision-making. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant moved to dismiss the accusatory instrument because it did not set forth adequate facts to support any of the charged offenses. In response, the People filed an affirmation in opposition setting forth additional unsworn facts not contained in the accusatory instrument. In reply to the opposition, defendant correctly pointed out the new facts contained in the opposition were not part of the accusatory instrument and could not cure any of its alleged jurisdictional defects. The court dismissed the accusatory instrument. The accusatory instrument did not even allege the physical proximity of defendant to the complainant during the incident. There were no facts that could be alleged to support the charge that defendant's conduct created a substantial risk of serious physical injury to another person and no circumstances demonstrating reasonable cause to believe the alleged act reasonably served to harass, annoy or alarm claimant, or threaten him with physical harm.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. A count of an accusatory instrument charging defendant with unlawfully possessing a police shield in violation of Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 14-107 based on the recovery of &quot;a full size detective shield from the defendant's right rear pocket&quot; following an incident in which he allegedly &quot;fire[d] a gun placing the complainant in fear of serious physical injury,&quot; must be dismissed, since the statutory provision relied upon is unconstitutionally vague.  The statute makes it &quot;unlawful for any person not a member of the police force ... to have, use, wear or display without specific authority from the commissioner any uniform, shield, buttons, wreaths, numbers or other insignia or emblem in any way resembling that worn by members of the police force.&quot; By criminalizing the mere possession of any of the proscribed police items without any specific scienter element, the statute fails to provide the average citizen of &quot;ordinary intelligence&quot; any guidance or fair notice as to what form of possessory conduct is permitted and what is prohibited.  The People may not prosecute defendant on the simple allegation that he had the shield in his pocket. To do so would permit a police officer to determine, without legislative guidance, that the shield, whether it was a near duplicate of a real detective's shield or a child's plastic toy, was criminal because it was covered by the broad &quot;in any way resembl[es]&quot; umbrella of the statute.  Constitutional guidelines do not permit the law to be applied in that manner.  Furthermore, the People may not rely upon the unsworn assertions in their opposition papers that defendant, upon entering complainant's motor vehicle, actually displayed the shield to complainant and misrepresented himself as a police officer in violation of that portion of the statute that prohibits a person from falsely representing himself or herself as being a member of the police force &quot;with a fraudulent design upon person or property.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, an indigent inmate, sought to commence a proceeding under the Freedom of Information Law and further sought leave to do so in forma pauperis, as a poor person entitled to have an index number issued by the clerk of the court without payment of a fee under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 1101(f).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">N.Y. C.P.L.R. 1101(f)(2) permitted court fees in proceedings by indigent inmates to be initially waived, but required the indigent inmates to later reimburse the court fees. The court sua sponte in a proceeding by petitioner, an indigent inmate, questioned the constitutionality of the statute because indigent non-inmates did not have to later reimburse court fees that had been waived. The court saw no rational basis for discriminating between poor persons who were not incarcerated and poor persons who were incarcerated. The legislative history of the statute revealed no intent to curtail frivolous prisoner suits. The purpose of the statute, to protect the rights of poor persons to bring civil actions, was thwarted. Prison inmates were to be afforded unhampered and equal access to the legal system. The statutory mandate violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ordered the clerk of the court to issue an index number to petitioner inmate free of charge as he was a poor person within the meaning of the statute and the statutory mandate requiring inmates to reimburse court fees was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Poor Person Status - Filing Fees for Prison Inmates - Equal Protection </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPLR 1101 (f), which authorizes the court to permit a prison inmate applying for poor person status in commencing litigation to pay a reduced filing fee, but removes any discretion to waive court costs, is unconstitutional insofar as the statute mandates immediate or deferred payment without possibility of discretionary waiver only if the movant is an indigent inmate. For equal protection purposes, poor inmates are similarly situated to poor noninmates through the common denominator of indigency and the impact of that indigency in commencing civil litigation. The fact that an inmate's essential needs are provided by the State does not make that inmate any less poor for purposes of applying for poor person status in filing an action.  Furthermore, requiring only inmates to pay filing fees cannot be deemed to be rationally related to a legitimate State interest in discouraging frivolous lawsuits by prisoners. The legislative history of CPLR 1101 (f) reveals no such intent to curtail frivolous prisoner suits within the State.  Rather, the purpose behind CPLR 1101 is to protect the rights of poor persons to bring civil actions.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with violating Babylon, N.Y., Town Code &sect;&sect; 213-398, -397 after he erected a free standing sign on the lawn in front of his house addressing the issue of police harassment and brutality against children and teens. Defendant moved to dismiss the charges. The charge of violation of &sect; 213-398 was dismissed because the section required a permit for signs in business and industrial district, and defendant erected the sign in a residential district. The court denied the motion to dismiss the charge of violation of &sect; 213-397 because it found that the regulation was narrowly tailored without regard to content and accomplished legitimate governmental purposes. Thus, the court rejected defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 213-397.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A motion to dismiss a charge that defendant violated a town ordinance prohibiting the display of signs on one's property without first securing a permit is denied where defendant posted a sign containing a political message on his front yard.  The government may properly limit the noncommunicative qualities of signs to promote the legitimate government aims of aesthetics and traffic safety, and the prosecution has submitted a number of applications for the temporary sign permits indicating that political messages are customarily displayed by this procedure.  The town is trying to promote aesthetic values and to promote traffic safety by avoiding visual distractions, physical obstructions and mistakes or confusion with authorized traffic signs.  These time, place and manner restrictions on speech must not be based upon the content of the speech, and the statutes must be narrowly tailored, so that the predominant effect is to limit the secondary results of the speech.  Defendant has not rebutted the strong presumption of constitutionality.  The zoning ordinances in question are narrowly tailored without regard to content, and accomplish legitimate governmental purposes.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court issued a decision upon the trial of the matter. Plaintiff State sought an order permanently enjoining further use of defendants' site as a construction and demolition debris landfill and directing defendants to close the site pursuant to requirements established under N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect;27-0703.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants voluntarily ignored a consent order's prohibitions against receiving additional construction and demolition debris (C&amp;D) materials at their site without having a permit. The agreement was clear and straightforward on its face. Defendants could not have escaped civil liability for admitted violations based upon their expressed intent to &quot;use&quot; rather than to &quot;dispose&quot; of C&amp;D material at the site. Defendants materials were classified as &quot;solid waste&quot; despite their contention that the materials were not spent, useless, worthless, or in excess to the owner at the time of such discard or rejection. Even if defendants claimed ownership of the material, certain portions of it were found to be &quot;in excess.&quot; N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 6, &sect; 360 was not so vague or overbroad to deny appropriate notice of the proscribed conduct and the regulation did not invest officials with unlimited discretion to enforce the regulations. The defendant corporations were paper shells created solely to limit liability; thus their corporate veil was pierced, and the individual defendants were personally liable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were directed to prepare and submit a closure plan for the site within 90 days. Plaintiff's request for a bond was denied. Court made permanent the preliminary injunction which enjoined and prohibited defendants from further depositing solid waste, including construction and demolition debris at the site. Individual defendant who disregarded the consent order was personally liable for penalties.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendants may not escape liability for illegally disposing of construction and demolition (C&amp;D) debris (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;6 NYCRR 360-1.2 [b] [38]) and other &quot;solid waste&quot; on their landfill site by alleging that they were legitimately &quot;using&quot; crushed and compacted C&amp;D materials on their site to prevent the further contamination of their land from an adjacent municipal landfill. The quantity of C&amp;D materials deposited at the site and the manner in which such materials were spread around the site indicates that the C&amp;D materials were more than a frontline barrier against the encroachment of the municipal landfill. In any event, regardless of what defendant's intended &quot;use&quot; of the materials was, the materials defendants deposited on their site without a permit and later bulldozed into more compact form and mixed with earth constitute &quot;discarded&quot; &quot;solid waste&quot; subject to regulation by the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) (6 NYCRR 360-1.2 [a] [2], [3]).  Furthermore, defendants have failed to demonstrate that the DEC regulations at issue were so vague or overbroad as to have denied defendants appropriate notice of the proscribed conduct.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation - Solid Waste Management Facility - Illegal Disposal of Construction and Demolition Debris - Personal Liability of Corporate Owners and Officers </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2.

It is appropriate to pierce the corporate veil to hold the corporate owners and officers personally liable, since the evidence demonstrates that the named corporations were little more than paper shells created solely to limit liability and that the individual defendants exercised complete domination of their respective corporations.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation - Solid Waste Management Facility - Illegal Disposal of Construction and Demolition Debris - Violation of Consent Order </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Defendant may be held liable for continuing to operate a solid waste disposal facility and accept construction and demolition (C&amp;D) debris at the site without a permit (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;6 NYCRR 360-1.2 [a] [2], [3]; [b] [38]) in violation of a 1989 consent order prepared by the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) in which he, as operator of the site owned by his father's closely held corporations, agreed to &quot;cease accepting solid waste&quot; at the site and to cease operations &quot;until a permit to operate is granted.&quot; The fact that defendant may have signed the consent order in order to avoid a possible $ 1,000 per day fine or the possible loss of ownership of the site is insufficient to set aside the order on the grounds that it was obtained by fraud or duress. The record demonstrates that defendant sought and received legal advice prior to signing. Moreover, defendant never sought to have the consent order set aside until the commencement of this action by the State seeking a determination that the consent order was violated.  The record also shows that defendant caused and directed activity aimed at potential compliance with its terms.  Furthermore, defendant cannot avoid liability by arguing that the later received materials were not C&amp;D materials within his understanding of &quot;solid waste.&quot; Defendant knew the nature of the materials which were deposited at this site and which prompted DEC to pursue enforcement of the consent order.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant moved the Criminal Court of the City of New York, New York County, New York, to dismiss a prosecuting instrument charging it with a violation of New York City, N.Y., Rules of the City of New York, tit. 34, &sect; 4-12(j)(1) regarding restrictions on commercial advertising vehicles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant leased, to a mobile advertising company, a truck operated on the streets of New York City, N.Y. New York City, N.Y., Rules of the City of New York, tit. 34, &sect; 4-12(j)(1) prohibited the operation of a vehicle on city streets for the purposes of advertising. Defendant was issued a summons for violation of this ordinance and moved to dismiss on U.S. Const. amend. I grounds. The ordinance met the requirements of the four-part test for determining the validity of the regulation of commercial speech in that it did not purport to ban only advertising that concerned unlawful activity or was misleading, it sought to implement a substantial governmental interest in promoting public safely by reducing the congestion of automobiles on the city's streets, directly advanced that interest, and reached no further than necessary to accomplish its objective, in that it did not seek to regulate the content of speech. The use of the term &quot;commercial advertising&quot; was not impermissibly vague, as that term has been well defined by commercial speech doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's motion to dismiss was denied because the ordinance in question was a permissible regulation of the time, place or manner of commercial speech, as opposed to aa impermissible regulation of its content, and it effectuated the significant government interest in public safety by reducing the congestion of automobiles on the city's streets.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. A Traffic Rule which bans the operation or parking of vehicles in the City of New York &quot;for the purpose of commercial advertising&quot; (34 RCNY 4-12 [j] [1]), except for advertising notices appearing on vehicles owned by the advertised business, is not unconstitutional as an impermissible regulation of commercial speech by a municipality. The Rule does not impermissibly differentiate based upon the content of the message advertised. Rather, the Rule makes no effort to regulate the content of the prohibited speech.  The City adopted the Rule in order to promote traffic safety and alleviate traffic congestion, not to suppress any particular advertised message. Therefore, even though the regulation is based on a particular medium of expression and distinguishes between messages carried on that medium, it remains neutral as to the expression's content.  The ban on the use of advertising-only vehicles is narrowly tailored to remove a class of vehicles from the City's streets. The removal of these vehicles from the streets fulfills the City's purpose of reducing the over-all number of vehicles congesting the City's streets. Accordingly, the Rule is not unconstitutional as a ban of commercial speech. </SPAN></P>

A Traffic Rule which bans the operation or parking of vehicles in the City of New York &quot;for the purpose of commercial advertising&quot; (34 RCNY 4-12 [j] [1]), except for advertising notices appearing on vehicles owned by the advertised business, is not unconstitutionally vague in failing to provide fair warning to a person of ordinary intelligence as to the precise nature of what is prohibited.  Although the Rule does not define the term &quot;commercial advertising,&quot; the distinction between &quot;commercial advertising&quot; prohibited by the Rule and other noncommercial forms of advertising is clear.  Under the Rule the focus is not upon whether defendant, the operator of a mobile advertising business, charges a fee for advertising on its vehicles.  Rather, the prohibition is upon a vehicle carrying advertising which proposes an economic transaction that is unrelated to the business for which that vehicle is used.  Consequently, without fear of prosecution, defendant can operate vehicles with political advertising or advertising for nonprofit entities.  </SPAN></P>

Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 727 was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to plaintiff. The court found that the assessment exceeded full value and that &sect; 727 was unconstitutional to the extent that defendants sought to apply it to defeat plaintiff's claim for relief from an assessment in excess of the limit imposed by N.Y.

Plaintiff is also entitled to a declaration that RPTL 727, which provides that where an assessment being reviewed is found excessive by final court order or judgment the assessed valuation cannot be changed for the next three annual succeeding assessment rolls, is unconstitutional to the extent that defendants seek to apply the moratorium to defeat plaintiff's claim to reduce the assessment, thereby granting plaintiff the right to prosecute the underlying tax certiorari proceeding. A subsequent owner, though on actual notice of the facts or of the prior excessive assessment, should be free to test the validity of a prior assessment, unless the subsequent owner had waived any right to complain by some complicity in a prior adjustment within the moratorium period.  Plaintiff was not privy to the tax certiorari negotiations and its interests were not considered in the final deal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's assigned attorney applied, under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with rape, unlawful imprisonment, and assault. Due to a conflict of interest, a special prosecutor was appointed, and he planned to charge the county $ 200 per hour for in-court and out-of-court time. Defendant's assigned attorney, according to N.Y. County Law &sect;722(b), was to be paid $ 40 per hour for in-court time, and $ 25 per hour for out-of-court time. He claimed the disparity in hourly rates denied defendant equal protection of the law. The court determined that if the argument prevailed, &sect; 722(b) would have been rendered a nullity, because the rate paid would have been dependent upon the rate of each special prosecutor, or the position the regular prosecutor held in the district attorney's hierarchy. Also, caselaw permitted an increased hourly rate only if extraordinary circumstances were demonstrated. Such a showing could not have been made until the case was concluded.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The affected County lacks the right to intervene pursuant to CPLR 1013 in an application by assigned counsel for an indigent criminal defendant prior to trial to be compensated at the same hourly rate as the Special Prosecutor that had been appointed in the case, even though it has a financial interest in the outcome of the proceeding.  The County's opposition to assigned counsel's application is premature since a fee award is amenable to an administrative review, not an appellate review, and only after the allowance has been made.  Although the County lacks the right to intervene, but has the right to complain through administrative channels at the proper time, its reply in opposition will be considered as an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">amicus curiae</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> memorandum.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney and Client - Assignment of Counsel - Compensation - Reimbursement of Assigned Counsel at Same Hourly Rate as Special Prosecutor </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. An application by assigned counsel for an indigent criminal defendant prior to trial to be compensated at the same hourly rate as the Special Prosecutor that had been appointed in the case is not premature. Although an attorney assigned to represent an indigent defendant in a criminal action must normally describe in detail the extraordinary circumstances which would justify a fee in excess of the statutory rates (County Law &sect; 722-b) and request appropriate compensation at the conclusion of the representation of the defendant, assigned counsel herein is merely seeking a determination that he should be reimbursed at the same hourly rate as the Special Prosecutor. If assigned counsel is entitled to such a favorable ruling, it can be made at this pretrial juncture, since the hourly rate will be applicable to past and future services.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney and Client - Assignment of Counsel - Compensation - Authority of Trial Court to Increase Maximum Statutory Hourly Rate Based on Extraordinary Circumstances - Reimbursement of Assigned Counsel at Same Hourly Rate as Special Prosecutor </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. The trial court presiding over a criminal proceeding has the authority to increase the hourly rate of compensation for assigned counsel for the indigent criminal defendant in excess of the statutory maximum hourly rates upon a showing of extraordinary circumstances (County Law &sect; 722-b).  The court's discretion to award compensation in excess of the statutory amounts encompasses both the hourly rate as well as the total amount.  However, in this case, the application by assigned counsel to be compensated at the same hourly rate that the Special Prosecutor intends to charge the County must be denied at this pretrial juncture. The mere disparity alone between the hourly compensation paid to the Special Prosecutor and the defense attorney for their services in the same criminal action does not support an increased hourly rate for assigned counsel. If compensation for assigned counsel were based in every instance upon the compensation paid to the prosecutor, whether it is a Special or regular prosecutor, section 722-b would be rendered a nullity.  Furthermore, defense counsel cannot make the requisite showing of extraordinary circumstances since the criminal action has not been concluded.  The court reserves the right to award assigned counsel an hourly fee in excess of the statutory rates if extraordinary circumstances are shown after the criminal action is terminated.  </SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and found that the statute provided defendant with adequate notice of the conduct prohibited but afforded law enforcement officials with an objective standard to avoid the possibility that the law would be arbitrarily applied.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (vii), which provides that a person may be guilty of first degree murder if the victim was killed &quot;in the course of&quot; and &quot;in furtherance of&quot; the commission of certain enumerated felonies, is not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The above-quoted phrases, which defendant asserts are constitutionally infirm and are used in the definition of noncapital felony murder, have implicitly passed constitutional muster in the past and nothing compels a different result. Moreover, the statute is not irrationally underinclusive because it fails to include certain felonies which purportedly are equally as serious (i.e., digital rape) as those which are listed as rendering a murder death eligible. A capital punishment statute need only genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty and must reasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sentence on the defendant compared to others found guilty of murder. Sufficient reasons exist, including the level of violence associated with the felony committed during a murder, to justify the distinctions drawn by the Legislature.  </SPAN></P>

Consequently, petitioners' &quot;causes of action for declaratory judgment&quot; are clearly subject to judicial review as article 78 proceedings.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limitation of Actions - What Statute Governs - 60-Day Limitations Period Applicable to Proceedings against Adirondack Park Agency </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2.  CPLR article 78 proceedings brought by petitioners in October and December 1999 challenging, on various grounds, the validity of the State's acquisition on July 1, 1999 of thousands of acres of forest lands and a conservation easement over more forest lands located within the Adirondack Park must be dismissed as time barred pursuant to the 60-day Statute of Limitations applicable to proceedings challenging the issuance of a permit by respondent Adirondack Park Agency (Executive Law &sect; 818 [1]).  Since the Adirondack Park Agency was the lead State agency in the administrative approval of the land and easement acquisition project, the proceedings herein are subject to the shorter limitations period running from the date of the Agency's issuance of the necessary permit on July 1, 1999.  Moreover, even if the normal four-month limitations period for article 78 proceedings applies to the other State respondents and/or to the private respondents as necessary parties, the proceedings as to those respondents are also time barred due to the failure to have obtained personal jurisdiction over any such respondents within 15 days after the expiration of the four-month limitations period ( CPLR 217 [1]).  Furthermore, petitioners have failed to demonstrate &quot;good cause&quot; to extend the time for service, nor have they shown any other reason to be granted additional time in the interests of justice.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - Jurisdiction - Jurisdiction of Supreme Court over Monetary Claims against State </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Where Supreme Court dismissed as time barred CPLR article 78 proceedings brought by petitioners challenging the validity of the State's acquisition of thousands of acres of forest lands and a conservation easement over more forest lands located within the Adirondack Park, petitioners' causes of action seeking monetary damages for respondents' alleged interference with property and contractual rights must also be dismissed.  Generally, the State can be sued on monetary claims only in the Court of Claims.  While it is possible to receive money damages from the State in an article 78 proceeding where such damages are only incidental to the main relief requested, the dismissal of all of the article 78 proceedings herein renders the exception to the general rule inapplicable.  Supreme Court thus clearly lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the claims for monetary relief.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent was convicted of a violation of 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2252A(b)(2) dealing with the knowing possession of child pornography. After respondent was released on parole, he was notified by the New York State Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders that his case was identified for review under N.Y. Correct. Law &sect;138-a, 2(b). The board found registration to be necessary and notified respondent and the court that a risk level determination was required. Respondent argued that registration was inapplicable because he was not convicted of an offense in another jurisdiction which included all of the essential elements of a felony covered by the registration statute. Since the requirements of &sect; 168-a, 2(b) were not satisfied, respondent's registration was questionable; however, the issue had to be resolved through a proceeding pursuant to N.Y.

There is no avenue of review by the court of the Board's determination, and the court's role is relegated to that of determining respondent's risk assessment level.  While it is questionable whether respondent should be required to register, that issue must be resolved through a CPLR article 78 proceeding challenging the Board's determination.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought an order declaring both N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 320.10 and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, cl. 3, unconstitutional, or, in the alternative, inapplicable to the guilt phase of defendant's trial. The challenged laws prohibited a capital defendant from waiving a jury in the guilt phase and the punishment phase, respectively, of the proceedings. Defendant's motion was denied. Because defendant had yet to request a jury trial, his case was not ripe, however, any such request would have been denied. The court, therefore, considered the merits of defendant's argument and denied the motion. Defendant had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the challenged provisions were unconstitutional, or should have been invalidated. Neither the federal nor the state constitution guaranteed a defendant a right to a bench trial, capital defendant's were not a suspect class, and the provisions were rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Right to Bench Trial </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although defendant's indictment for first degree murder brings him squarely within the statutory scheme which he argues is facially defective, viz., NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 2 and CPL 320.10, which prohibit a capital defendant from waiving his right to a jury trial, the issue of the unconstitutionality of the aforementioned provisions is not ripe inasmuch as defendant has yet to request a bench trial.  Even if defendant were to make a perfunctory request for a bench trial, the same would be denied.  The Federal and State Constitutions guarantee a defendant a right to a jury trial, but no similar guarantee is bestowed upon the right to a bench trial.  Nor are capital defendants a suspect class under an equal protection analysis. Since there is neither a suspect class nor a fundamental right at issue, the Equal Protection Clause merely prescribes that the prohibition bear a rational relationship to a legitimate government purpose, and the prohibitions against nonjury trials allow a jury to act as a safeguard between an individual and the tyranny of the State, and reflect the legitimate reluctance to entrust plenary powers over the life and liberty of the citizen to one Judge, rather than to 12 jurors who represent the conscience and moral judgment of the community.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant surety posted a bail bond for defendant client, who was released from custody.

Defendant client failed to appear, a bench warrant was issued, and bail was forfeited.

The court granted the motion, finding N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 210.10(2) required notice of arraignment to defendant surety. The motion addressed the inherent power of the court to vacate its own actions. While defendant surety did not have due process rights in regard to bond forfeiture, N.Y. Crim. Proc.

CPL 210.10 (2) provides that the superior court must notify the defendant, his or her attorney, and his or her surety, of the date of the defendant's arraignment. The word &quot;must&quot; is mandatory language as it relates to the notice to the defendant, the attorney and the surety. The best way to ensure that the surety fulfills its obligation to produce defendant is to notify the surety of the arraignment date.  In addition, CPL 210.10 (2) creates a nondelegable duty on the superior court to comply with the requirements of this section.  Moreover, the court must give actual notice to the surety by personal service. </SPAN></P>
