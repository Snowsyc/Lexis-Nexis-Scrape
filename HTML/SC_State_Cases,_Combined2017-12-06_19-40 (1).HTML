HOLDINGS: [1]-The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying joinder because he based his decision upon a just and proper consideration of the issues; [2]-The trial court did not err in considering the solicitor's authority to determine the manner in which the solicitor proceeded with the case's prosecution; [3]-The trial judge abused his discretion in finding that the proffered testimony of a witness, which contradicted the victims' testimony, was not relevant under S.C. R. Evid. 401, and, as a result, defendant was prejudiced, even though the credibility of the testimony could have been called into question.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trial court of Aiken County, South Carolina, convicted defendant of two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor and two counts of lewd act upon a child. Defendant sought review, arguing that the trial court erred in admitting evidence regarding his suicide attempt and in charging the jury that the testimony of a child witness did not need to be corroborated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue of whether evidence of a suicide attempt was probative of defendant's consciousness of guilt was an issue of first impression, but the court concluded that such evidence was generally admissible. It found the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence of his suicide attempt because the circumstances surrounding his attempt gave rise to the inference that defendant was aware of the sexual misconduct allegations against him by a victim at the time he made the attempt. Thus, it was relevant evidence under S.C. R. Evid. 401 and 402. The trial court did not commit reversible error in giving the charge pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-3-657 (2003) that a victim's testimony in criminal sexual misconduct cases did not need to be corroborated. The trial court properly charged the jury on the State's burden of proof and the jury's duty to determine the facts and judge the credibility of witnesses, and the single instruction under &sect; 16-3-657 was not unduly emphasized.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed her conviction for crack cocaine, but the appellate court affirmed. The denial of defendant's motion for a continuance was proper because an audiotape provided evidence that served to inculpate rather than exculpate defendant. The evidence provided proof that defendant was in fact in possession of crack cocaine on the night of her arrest. Furthermore, the record did not indicate the State intended to use the audiotape as evidence in chief at the trial. In fact, the State never introduced the audiotape or a transcript of its contents into evidence. The facts thus showed that there was no S.C. R. Crim. P. 5 violation. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to quash the indictment based on selective prosecution because she failed to establish that she was singled out for prosecution on unconstitutional grounds. She did not allege, nor did the record contain, anything to show that the State chose to prosecute her based solely on impermissible grounds such as her gender or race.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent lenders obtained a default judgment against appellant borrower on the amount due under a loan in another state. The lenders filed the judgment in South Carolina.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the issue of personal jurisdiction had not been fully litigated in the forum state. It determined that the borrower's minimum contacts with the forum state where sufficient to establish specific jurisdiction over him. He executed the loan agreement as a part-owner of a company in the forum state, the loan proceeds were used to construct a golf course and subdivision in the forum state, and he frequently traveled to the forum state to oversee the operation of the company and monitor the use of the loan proceeds. The choice of law provision in the parties' agreement named the state as the proper forum for the resolution of any dispute. Between his actions and the parties' agreement, the borrower was on notice of being haled into court in the forum state. While the borrower did not raise the issue and it was not preserved for review, the court found that the burden on the borrower of defending an action in the forum state was not inconsistent with the notions of fair play and substantial justice. Because the forum state had personal jurisdiction over the borrower, the trial court's order enforcing the out-of-state default judgment against the borrower was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent creditors filed suit to enforce a default judgment entered against appellant debtor in Alabama. The debtor moved for relief from judgment under S.C. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(4) and S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 15-35-940, arguing that the judgment was void for lack of personal jurisdiction. He challenged an order of the Circuit Court, Darlington County (South Carolina), which denied his motion and directed that the judgment be entered in South Carolina.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The creditors and debtor entered into a loan agreement. The court of appeals held that the debtor maintained sufficient minimum contacts to satisfy the Alabama long-arm rule, Ala. R. Civ. P. 4.2, and federal due process. The debtor's contacts with Alabama reasonably suggested that he should have anticipated being haled into court in Alabama. His connections sufficed to meet the requirements of specific personal jurisdiction in Alabama. The loan agreement involved a subdivision and golf course in Alabama, and the loan was made for use in the construction and development of the subdivision and golf course located in Alabama. The agreement provided that the debtor was a one-third owner of the Alabama development and also indicated that he was jointly and severally liable for the payment of all sums advanced and due under the agreement. It contained a choice of law provision indicating that the agreement was to be construed and enforced under the laws of Alabama. The debtor testified that he traveled to Alabama on at least twelve occasions over the course of two years to monitor the progress of the development. He also attended the grand opening of the development.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty by a jury in the Sumter County Circuit Court (South Carolina) of four of five counts of committing a lewd act upon a minor and was acquitted of criminal sexual conduct with a minor. He was sentenced to a total of thirty years' imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the indictments as overly broad. The offenses complained of occurred from June 1998 through September 2004, and defendant was served notice of the amended indictments on October 3, 2006. Because time was not an element of either of the offenses with which he was charged, and the time period covered by the indictments occurred prior to the return of the indictments, the indictments were not overly broad. The indictments clearly identified the elements of lewd act and criminal sexual conduct, tracking the statutory language of S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 16-15-140 and 16-3-655. The trial court did not err in limiting defendant's cross-examination of one of the victims pursuant to S.C. R. Evid. 608(c). Defendant argued that two school discipline matters were admissible to show that the victim made up the allegations of abuse to distract attention from her misdeeds; however, one matter was too insignificant to result in such a drastic fabrication, and the other, her expulsion from school, occurred after she had already reported the abuse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate filed a grievance with defendant, the South Carolina Department of Corrections, concerning conditions of his participation in the Prison Industries Program (PIP). The Administrative Law Court (ALC) upheld the Department's denial of overtime wages and reimbursement for pay deductions. The Jasper County Circuit Court (South Carolina) affirmed but remanded to the ALC for a determination of the prevailing wage. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a participant in PIP, the inmate provided on-site labor at the Ridgeland Correctional Institution, sometimes working in excess of ninety hours per two-week period, for a furniture maker. The inmate was compensated at a rate of $ 5.50 per hour. He complained his hourly wage was insufficient compared to the prevailing wage for similar work performed in the private sector, that he did not receive overtime pay, and that the Department improperly withheld funds from his paychecks. The court held that S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 24-3-315 and 24-3-430(E) required that inmate workers receive comparable compensation and prohibited inmate workers from displacing non-inmate workers. These provisions supported an award of overtime pay. Failure to provide inmate workers with time-and-a-half pay for overtime hours when their non-inmate counterparts received it would create an impermissible and unfair advantage for inmate labor over private labor. The court held that deductions from the inmate's pay for the Victim's Assistance Fund and room and board were proper under S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 24-3-40, 16-3-1260, 16-3-1290.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court rejected the manufacturer's numerous arguments and affirmed the judgment. In particular, the court found that an expert regarding the cause and origin of the fire properly testified exclusively in the area of his expertise. Another expert properly responded to the owners' hypothetical question, and the manufacturer was properly precluded from cross-examining the owners' experts about the company that manufactured the defective switch for it. A particular expert's appraisal of the value of the owners' home was properly excluded under S.C. R. Evid. 803(6) because it contained a subjective opinion. Significantly, the court rejected the manufacturer's arguments and upheld the punitive damage award. In particular, the court found that the award was not constitutionally excessive. Further, the evidence demonstrated that the manufacturer engaged in reckless, willful, and wanton conduct because it had knowledge that a seal's failure could cause fires, but it did not make any changes in the switch or seal in its vehicles. The ratio between the compensatory and punitive damages was not excessive, and the punitive damage award was comparable to awards in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

Second, by appealing a ruling it knew was not appealable, the county essentially asked the circuit court to render an advisory opinion on the propriety of the magistrate's rulings. But, the county's appeal to the circuit court was not reviewed as a civil proceeding because it was an appeal from a directed verdict of acquittal. The appeal was criminal, rather than civil, in nature because the dancers originally faced criminal charges before the magistrate. Further, the South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure, rather than the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. applied when parties appealed a magistrate's ruling in a criminal case to the circuit court. Therefore, the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act did not apply to the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court violated the double jeopardy provision of the federal and state constitutions by allowing the county's, and by addressing the issues the county raised, the circuit court erroneously issued an advisory opinion. But, the circuit court properly denied the dancers' motion for attorney's fees and costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant applicant filed a petition with the Bamberg County Circuit Court (South Carolina), for postconviction relief (PCR). The PCR judge denied the petition and pursuant to S.C. R. Civ. P. 11 fined the applicant for presenting frivolous claims and testimony. Subsequently, the applicant filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment under S.C. R. Civ. P. 59(e), which was denied. The applicant filed a petition for writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant contended that the PCR court did not have the authority in a PCR proceeding to sanction the applicant under S.C. R. Civ. P. 11. On appeal, the court found that the South Carolina Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-27-10 et seq. (Supp. 2006), contemplated the applicability of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure in PCR actions because S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-27-80 (Supp. 2006) stated that all rules and statutes applicable in civil proceedings were available to the parties in a PCR proceeding. Further, the plain language of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-27-10 (Supp. 2006) required that all rules that applied in a civil case applied to PCR actions. Furthermore, a PCR action was a civil action. Additionally, the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure supported the conclusion that S.C. R. Civ. P. 11 was applicable to PCR actions. Given the plain language of S.C. R. Civ. P. 1 and 71.1 and that S.C. R. Civ. P. 11 was consistent with the Act, ample justification existed to conclude that Rule 11 applied to PCR actions. Accordingly, the PCR court had authority to issue Rule 11 sanctions against the applicant in the PCR proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All defendants asserted that the trial court erred in failing to follow the proper procedure for a Batson challenge. Defendant one also claimed that his speedy trial rights were violated and that the State had violated S.C. R. Crim. P. 3. With respect to the Batson challenge, the court found that while the trial court did not specifically articulate reasoning for finding defendants' explanations for challenging nine individuals of a particular racial group were not racially neutral, the record contained sufficient justification to conclude that there was no abuse of discretion. The trial court properly quashed the entire jury panel, returned the jurors' names to the jury venire, and began the jury selection process anew. Defendant one's speedy trial rights under U.S. Const. amend. XI and S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 14, were not violated because defendant did not show prejudice resulting from the lapse of 15 months from the date of his indictment to the date of trial. Further, the State's violation of S.C. R. Crim. P. 3 was not cause for reversal because that rule was administrative rather than substantive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Greenwood County Circuit Court (South Carolina) convicted defendant of forgery, and denied her motion for a directed verdict, she appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged her conviction, contending that the trial court erred in denying her: (1) motion for a directed verdict; (2) request to charge the jury on a good faith defense; and (3) request to instruct the jury on use of evidence of good character. The appeals court disagreed with her first contention, as the evidence supported the State's allegation that defendant's conduct met the statutory definition of forgery. Second, the court was unaware of any South Carolina authority acknowledging a good faith defense to the crime of forgery. Hence, no error resulted in the trial court refusing to issue a good faith defense instruction. But, the appeals court agreed that the jury should have been charged on evidence of defendant's good character, and indubitably, the jury struggled with this case, to the point an Allen charge was given. Thus, it seemed fair to conclude the struggle centered around whether the State proved the critical element of criminal intent. As the element of intent was inextricably connected to defendant's character, the appeals court could not say, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the good character charge would not have made a difference in the outcome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Aiken County Circuit Court (South Carolina) of driving under the influence and criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature. At a postconviction relief hearing, the judge imposed two consecutive, one-year sentences for contempt to run consecutively to defendant's prior five year sentences, but the orders signed by the judge imposed two consecutive, six-month sentences for contempt. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the judge accepted the withdrawal of defendant's application for postconviction relief at a hearing, defendant made an obscene gesture to his trial counsel before leaving the courtroom. The judge then held defendant in contempt and sentenced him to one year imprisonment consecutive to his prior sentence. Defendant then exclaimed a profanity to the judge. The judge held defendant in contempt for the statement and sentenced him to another year consecutive to defendant's then sentence. However, the orders signed by the judge imposed two consecutive, six-month sentences for contempt on defendant to be served consecutively to his prior sentences. On appeal, the court found that the judge did not abuse his discretion in holding defendant in contempt for making an obscene gesture at trial counsel. Additionally, defendant did not appeal the finding of contempt for the profane outburst directed at the judge. Thus, it was the law of the case. Finally, although defendant was entitled to a jury trial because the aggregate of his sentences for contempt exceeded six months, he did not request a jury trial nor did he object. Thus, that issue was not preserved for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued the trial court erred in sentencing him because assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct with a minor, first degree, was not enumerated in S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-25-45. The appellate court disagreed. The statute designated any attempt for any offense enumerated in that item as a most serious offense. An assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the first degree was more aptly designated as an &quot;attempt&quot; to commit criminal sexual conduct with a minor. There was no merit to defendant's allegations that his prior uncounseled conviction should not have been used for sentence enhancement, because he presented no evidence that he was actually incarcerated for the prior, uncounseled conviction. The only evidence before the trial court was defendant's own testimony that he served only a probationary sentence. The trial court did not err in allowing an amendment to the indictment, because the &quot;erroneous&quot; listing of charges and codes on the sentencing sheet were scrivener's errors. The sentencing sheet was not part of the indictment and did not affect the nature of the offense charged.</SPAN></P>

In one of the offices, he operated his own optometry business. In addition, he received rental income from an unrelated, commercial tenant occupying another office within the building. Defendant paid no business license fee related to the rental of commercial property to either of the businesses. The city contended that defendant, as a commercial landlord, should have obtained a business license and paid fees based on the rental income generated from the property he leased to the third party. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the city's application of the ordinance. He argued that the city's unwritten exemption for property owners who rented to themselves violated his equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. On appeal, the court found that there was a rational and reasonable basis for the city's classifications of property owners. Accordingly, the challenged ordinance as applied was not plainly arbitrary and did not violate defendant's equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

The father did not respond to the action or appear. The Berkeley County (South Carolina) family court denied visitation to appellant, who was not related to the child. Appellant challenged the family court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant at first believed that he was the child's father. After testing excluded him, he continued in what was essentially a joint custody arrangement. After appellant reported suspected abuse by the mother, she terminated his contact with the child. The court held that the family court erred in finding that appellant lacked standing to bring an action for visitation. The South Carolina Supreme Court had recognized the doctrine of a psychological parent. Adopting a four-factor test from Wisconsin, the court held that appellant met the first factor, invitation by the mother to act as a father. The second prong, residence of the child with appellant, had also been met. Appellant met the third prong by taking significant responsibility for the child's care, education, and development. As for the fourth prong, a parental-like bond, the child had spent 10 years thinking of appellant as a father and was suffering in his absence. Next, a family court could grant visitation to a third party over a fit parent's objection when faced with compelling circumstances. Such circumstances existed here because of the significant harm the mother's refusal of visitation was causing the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the family court's order and remanded the action so that a suitable visitation schedule could be established as expeditiously as possible. Appellant was to have one weekend per month until a final hearing could be scheduled.</SPAN></P>

The Horry County Circuit Court (South Carolina) denied summary judgment to the insurer and granted summary judgment to the city. The insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the underlying class action suit, an ordinance implemented by the city relating to water bills for leased property was declared unconstitutional. In the class action, it was determined that each member of the class was entitled to a refund of any monies paid for another's water bill. The city sought coverage under a general liability insurance policy issued by the insurer. The insurer argued that it was not required to defend or indemnify the city on the basis of a policy provision excluding coverage for inverse condemnation, condemnation, and eminent domain. The trial court concluded the refunds constituted &quot;damages&quot; under the policy. The appellate court held that the heart of the controversy was the taking by the city of the class members' money without just compensation. The violation of the class members' rights to due process and equal protection would not have occurred but for the wrongful exercise by the city of its eminent domain power. Thus, the claim at issue fell within the policy exclusion, and the insurer was not required to indemnify the city for its loss.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother sought review of the judgment from the Greenville County Family Court (South Carolina), which sentenced her to one year in prison for willful contempt of a prior order against the mother and her husband requiring them to ensure that their eight-year-old daughter regularly attend school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1996 the family court issued a written order requiring the mother and her husband to ensure that their eight-year-old daughter regularly attend school. When the daughter was 14, the mother and her husband were summoned to answer allegations of educational neglect in connection with their daughter. The family court judge found them in willful contempt of the 1996 order and sentenced both of them to a year in prison. On appeal, the court affirmed, first finding that because the mother was not afforded a jury trial, the sentence, over six months long, violated U.S. Const. art. III, &sect; 2, and the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted by Bloom v. Illinois. The court then refused to dismiss the appeal as moot even though the mother had served her sentence because the sentence was too brief to be fully litigated through appeal prior to its expiration. However, the court then found that although the mother did suffer a violation of her right to a jury trial, because she failed to raise an objection at trial, the court was compelled to let the unconstitutional sentence stand. The court noted that South Carolina courts did not follow the plain error rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner sued defendants, a county and its park and recreation commission, alleging their expansion of a boat ramp near his property constituted a taking, an inverse condemnation, and a nuisance. The Charleston County Circuit Court (South Carolina) denied the owner's motion for partial summary judgment; at the conclusion of testimony, it directed a verdict for defendants. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of defendants' expansion of the boat ramp, a street in front of the owner's property was used to queue up boaters for the landing, which restricted his access to his properties. In addition, he could not access another street from the front of his house because the road had raised curbs that made it one-directional in the opposite way. The appellate noted that an obstruction that deprived an abutting property owner of ingress or egress to and from his property was a compensable ''taking.'' That the commission lacked eminent domain power did not render its expansion of the boat ramp any less a taking under S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 13; therefore, the trial court erred in directing a verdict against the owner on his inverse condemnation claim on the ground that he did not name the town as a defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court found the taxpayers failed to exhaust the administrative remedies prescribed under the South Carolina Revenue Procedures Act (RPA), S.C.

The trial court dismissed the taxpayers' action on the ground that they failed to exhaust the administrative remedies prescribed under the RPA. On appeal, the court found that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-43-285 (Supp. 2003) did not supplant the remedial scheme of the RPA. Had the South Carolina Legislature intended to allow for direct action in circuit court, in contravention of the broadly defined scope of the RPA, it could have expressly provided for such immediate judicial review. The taxpayers were required to exhaust their administrative remedies under the RPA before their suit could receive judicial review. The court further found unpersuasive the taxpayers' arguments that the RPA did not apply to their action and that the RPA was unconstitutional. Finally, the court found that because further development of the factual record would not have aided in determining the statutory and constitutional questions raised, the trial court acted appropriately in deciding the issue on a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted motions to dismiss the suit for lack of personal jurisdiction and under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 15-5-150 (1977). The individuals appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The author interviewed various people, including the interviewee, about an explosion that occurred on board a U.S. Navy ship in which sailors were killed.

The individuals alleged that the book contained numerous falsities that suggested their actions led to the deaths of the sailors aboard the ship. On appeal, the court found that the trial court properly dismissed the causes of action against the author and the interviewee because personal jurisdiction did not exist over them under the minimum contacts requirements of due process. However, personal jurisdiction existed as to the publisher because the minimum contacts requirements were met as to the publisher. It was shown that the publisher marketed and distributed books in the State of South Carolina on an ongoing basis. Further, South Carolina's Door Closing Statute,&nbsp;S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 15-5-150, did not bar the individuals from bringing suit against the publisher because there was a continuing publication of the book in South Carolina upon each sale and upon each dissemination in the State. Printing the book outside the State was not controlling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent husband and wife sued appellant trucking company after they were injured in an auto accident. They obtained an entry of default against the company, and the Spartanburg County Circuit Court (South Carolina) awarded them actual and punitive damages. The company moved to alter or amend the judgment; respondents moved to open the judgment. The trial court denied the company's motion and granted respondents' motion; the company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company's employee ran a stop sign and the tractor-trailer truck he was driving hit respondents' car. The husband had four surgeries and would require surgery every two years for the rest of his life. The appellate court held his award of $ 850,000 in actual damages was supported by evidence of $ 170,011 in past and future medical bills, his extreme pain and suffering, impaired ability to work, and loss of enjoyment of life. The award of $ 175,000 in actual damages to the wife was proper, based on $ 57,460 in actual damages, and her need to take leave from her job as a nurse in order to care for her husband. The employee's violation of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 56-5-2330(b) by failing to stop was negligence per se and justified punitive damages, which, at about 2.5 times actual damages ($ 2.16 million to the husband and $ 442,000 to the wife), were not excessive. As the employee was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident, the trial judge properly found the company liable for his torts; he had been dismissed as a party to the case, not exonerated from liability. The company had not appealed the trial court's order allowing the complaint to be amended.</SPAN></P>

Respondents, the testator's estate's co-personal representative and the testator's heirs, had instituted the action in the probate court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The testator died in 1954 and devised a life estate to the daughter's father with the remainder to the father's child or children and a contingent remainder to the testator's heirs at law if the father died without children. The father died with the illegitimate daughter his only issue. The representative and heirs sought a declaration that the testator's will excluded the daughter. The probate court found for the daughter and the trial court reversed. On appeal, the daughter argued that the trial court erred when it applied 1954 law to construe the will. The court disagreed and held that the law as it existed in 1954 applied. Even if more current law applied, no state action or intestacy required the application of equal protection principles. The law provided that the word &quot;children&quot; did not include illegitimate children, except when the testator's intent to include them was clear, and South Carolina law in 1954 embraced that view. There was no error in dismissing the daughter's cross-appeal that the probate court erred by refusing to consider evidence outside the parties' stipulation of facts because she agreed to submit the matter to the probate court on stipulated facts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a company and its founder, sought review of an order of the Richland County Circuit Court (South Carolina) awarding respondent salesman damages, attorney fees, and prejudgment interest in his suit for breach of contract and violation of the Payment of Post-Termination Claims to Sales Representatives Act, S. C. Code Ann. &sect; 39-65-10 et seq. (Supp. 2001). The salesman cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants contended that the salesman failed to plead an oral modification to the parties' contract. The appellate court held that appellants had addressed the issue at trial, litigating it by consent. The trial court correctly held that the contract had been orally modified to encompass paying the salesman commissions for all products sold within his exclusive territory, regardless of whether they were pre-engineered. The calculation of prejudgment interest was correct. Because pre-judgment interest was mandatory under the statute for this claim, there was no error in the trial court's decision to correct the omission under S.C. R. Civ. P. 60(a), especially as the parties were not given notice of entry of the order in the usual manner. The trial court erred in applying the Act to the suit. The appellate court held that the usual dictionary meanings were applied to a &quot;sales representative,&quot; &quot;wholesale,&quot; and &quot;principal&quot; in the Act. The salesman did not fit within the meaning of &quot;sales representative&quot; as defined by the Act because he primarily sold to end users. This made the salesman ineligible for attorney fees and punitive damages under the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's awards of past due commissions and pre-judgment interest were affirmed. The trial court's denial of punitive damages under the Act was affirmed, and the trial court's award of attorney fees under the Act was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The wrecker appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court, in granting judgment against the wrecker, held that: (1) its claim for damages as a result of the department's Administrative Procedures Act (APA) violation was moot, and (2) it could not recover damages for inverse condemnation because it failed to allege a compensable property interest. The appeals court agreed that there was no meaningful relief available. The department violated the APA by failing to hold a hearing before removing the wrecker from a rotation list. Notwithstanding that finding, the wrecker received a hearing and was eventually reinstated to the list. The only question remaining was whether it was entitled to money damages for the time it was not on the list. The appeals court held that it could not seek money damages under the APA or under any analogous legislation absent an express provision recognizing such a claim. The court further held that summary judgment was proper on the wrecker's inverse condemnation claim because there was nothing to suggest that there was a taking for a public use. At best, the wrecker merely demonstrated that its removal benefitted other wrecker services on the rotation list.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, the Anderson County Circuit Court (South Carolina) found defendants guilty of willful failure to file state income tax returns. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that there was no constitutional authority to levy an income tax in South Carolina. The appellate court ruled that the general assembly was authorized to enact any law not prohibited by the South Carolina or federal Constitutions. Because there was no state or federal constitutional provision prohibiting the general assembly from levying an income tax, there was no merit to the argument that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-54-40 was null and void due to a lack of constitutional authority. While the constitutional provision of S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 16, as to form of enacting clause was mandatory, a substantial compliance with the mandate was sufficient. An absolutely literal compliance with the form prescribed was not essential to valid legislation. The enforcement of the filing of state income tax returns was reasonably and inherently related to the expenditure of tax money. The repeal of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-54-40 did not impair prosecution for the enforcement of criminal liability under the statute. Various claimed procedural and trial errors, a claim of judicial bias, and certain constitutional claims were not raised at trial and were unpreserved for appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant argued the trial court erred in allowing the admission of his prior burglary and housebreaking convictions when he stipulated to one of the elements of first degree burglary. The appellate court disagreed, finding that defendant's prior burglary convictions were offered to prove a statutory element of the current first degree burglary charge, not to suggest defendant was a bad person or committed the present burglary because he had committed prior burglaries. Despite defendant's attempt to stipulate that he met the legal status to be charged with first degree burglary, the trial court did not err in denying his request to limit the State to proof of only the &quot;nighttime&quot; element. Defendant failed to provide any evidence to support his allegation that the judge should have recused himself. However, the appellate court found the trial court erred in denying defendant an in camera hearing on the admissibility of his identification from a photographic lineup. Because defendant's defense included an alibi, and the identification of defendant was not corroborated, the error in failing to grant defendant an in camera hearing was not harmless.</SPAN></P>

The statement was not given after advise of Miranda by the probation officer, despite the fact that defendant was in custody. Furthermore, the State was prohibited from using the statement to impeach defendant, due to its involuntary nature. Defendant could not be compelled under the Fifth Amendment, to give testimony which would tend to show that he committed a crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted by a jury of the Circuit Court for York County, South Carolina, for possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court improperly refused his motion for a directed verdict on the charge of possession with intent to distribute because there was no evidence that he intended to distribute the crack cocaine. The State submitted testimony that defendant's arrest occurred in a high crime area and that defendant had a bag containing eight rocks of crack cocaine. He also had $ 322 cash in $ 20 bills. One police officer testified that a single rock of crack cocaine was typically sold for $ 20. The appellate court in viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, held that the combination these factors constituted evidence which reasonably proved that defendant intended to distribute the crack cocaine. Thus, the trial court's decision to submit the case to the jury for its determination was proper. The trial court's instruction that there was no legal distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence was held to be correct even though the traditional charge distinguished between the two types of evidence. Because the trial court adopted a charge that had been approved by the supreme court, it did not require reversal.</SPAN></P>

Police later returned the missing property. After his arrest, the defendant gave an oral statement in which he denied burglarizing the residence. The trial court permitted the State to introduce seven of the defendant's prior convictions for burglary over defense objections to the introduction of more than two prior offenses. Despite the prejudicial effect of this evidence, the trial court instructed the jury, as required, to limit its consideration of the defendant's prior convictions to the particular purpose for which the convictions were offered.

The permit was upheld. The Beaufort County Circuit Court (South Carolina) affirmed. Appellants, environmentalists, sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A groin was a structure built at least partially on the &quot;active beach,&quot; often of large rocks or timber, running perpendicular to the shore and extending into the ocean. It was designed to retard erosion by trapping littoral drift, that is, the shifting sand along the shore resulting from wave action. 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-1(D)(23) (Supp. 2000). A &quot;groin field&quot; was a series of two or more groins in close proximity exerting overlapping areas of influence. On appeal, the court of appeals held that the permit violated the statutory provisions of the Beachfront Management Act.  S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 48-39-290(A) prohibited respondent DHEC from issuing permits for the construction or reconstruction of new or existing groins.  S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 48-39-290(D) special permits were not available for structures &quot;other than erosion control structures&quot; located on the active beach. Groins, under the statutory construction principle that inclusion of one thing implied exclusion of another, were structures other than S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 48-39-270(1)'s listed erosion control structures: seawalls, bulkheads, and revetments. State policy was against such &quot;hard&quot; erosion control devices.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged a judgment of the Greenwood County Circuit Court, South Carolina, dismissing the State's indictment against appellee after concluding South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control had entered into a binding agreement on behalf of the State to forego criminal prosecution of appellee in exchange for payment of a civil sanction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was indicted for violating a pollution control statute. The trial court dismissed the indictment, concluding South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) had entered into a binding agreement on behalf of the State to forego criminal prosecution of appellee in exchange for the conveyance of the offending wastewater treatment facility. The State appealed, asserting, among other things, that DHEC did not have legal authority to bind the State to an agreement limiting criminal prosecution. The State further claimed the trial court erred in ruling that the State could be estopped from prosecuting appellee criminally. Judgment was reversed. The court concluded that DHEC could not legally bind the State's attorney general to a promise not to prosecute. It concluded that the power constitutionally granted to the attorney general to supervise the prosecution of criminal cases included the power to decide which cases to prosecute. Absent authority of the DHEC to enter into an agreement, the State could not be estopped from prosecuting appellee, as estoppel could not be applied to deprive the State of the due exercise of its police power.</SPAN></P>

When respondent denied the letter, he sought a declaratory judgment of his entitlement and a writ of mandamus to compel issuance of a letter, arguing that the action unconstitutionally interfered with operation of a site that would serve largely North Carolina customers. The court, despite slightly modifying the trial court's judgment, held that the statute made respondent, not zoning authorities, responsible for determining need for solid waste facilities, and that there was no reason to suppose that respondent failed to follow the statute in making that determination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent was employed by defendant institute as a nurse. Defendant doctor, a neurosurgeon, practiced at defendant institute. Decedent underwent back surgery at defendant institute; defendant doctor was the attending neurosurgeon. After surgery, the decedent was given a variety of pain medications; he subsequently died. The plaintiff initiated survival and wrongful death actions and was awarded damages, with a set-off due to settlement with a prior defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding the plaintiff presented sufficient evidence as to the standard of care and defendant doctor's deviation from that standard to support award of punitive damages; there was clear and convincing evidence of defendant doctor's reckless culpability for punitive damages, as he was aware of the manufacturer's warning concerning use of a transdermal patch post-operatively; defendants were not entitled to new trial due to size of the actual and punitive damages awards; punitive damages award was proper under Gamble and BMW; &quot;economic bankruptcy&quot; factor was not an absolute bar to imposition of punitive damages; and the defendants were entitled to set-off due to prior defendant's settlement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Plaintiff presented clear and convincing evidence of standard of care and of defendant doctor's deviation from that standard in using a transdermal patch post-operatively for decedent's pain, even though defendant doctor knew of manufacturer's warning of such use. Set-off in damages award was proper due to prior defendant's settlement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Lexington County Circuit Court (South Carolina), which convicted him of burglary, criminal sexual assault, and possession of a weapon during a violent crime. He contended the trial court erred in denying his right to counsel, in failing to suppress the victim's identifications, in denying his motion for a continuance because his expert witness was absent, and in sentencing him to consecutive life sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court properly denied defendant's request for a recess because defendant failed to subpoena an expert. Defendant also rejected the solicitor's offer to stipulate to the substance of the expert's proposed testimony. The trial court properly charged the jury regarding the difficulty of eyewitness identification. The victim described her attacker as a black male, and gave approximate weight and age before ultimately selecting defendant's photo without hesitation. Defendant also maintained that he hired a private attorney to represent him, which was refuted by the attorney. Defendant did not object and only raised the issue again after sentencing, when he complained the court had forced him to use a lawyer he did not want. Defendant, therefore, failed to preserve the issue for review. S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-25-45(A)(1) provided for a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole upon a defendant's conviction for a second most serious offense. A comparative analysis of the most serious offense subsections did not raise an inference of gross disproportionality and the enhanced penalty scheme was not unconstitutional per se.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were affirmed because there was no error in denying defendant a recess where he did not subpoena an expert witness, the lower court properly charged the jury regarding the difficulty of eyewitness identification, defendant failed to preserve the issue of choice of counsel for review, and the enhanced penalty imposed was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that the trial court erroneously charged the law on the crime of unlawful use of the telephone. The court found that the trial judge not only charged the statute but also defined all of the statutory terms. The trial court erroneously charged the law on the offense of unlawful use of the telephone. The error was not harmless; the court had to assume the jury followed the incorrect charge. It was clear that the telephone contained vulgar, profane, indecent, and immoral language as defined by the trial judge. In order to be convicted under the statute, however, the call had to be made with the intent and sole purpose of conveying an unsolicited obscene or imminently threatening message or made to harass the recipient. The trial judge lowered the burden necessary for the jury to find appellant guilty.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was previously convicted of murder and armed robbery in an incident that occurred four hours prior to the armed robbery in appellant's current conviction. Appellant sought review of the sentence and alleged that &sect; 17-25-45(A) did not apply because the crimes were part of a single, continuous crime spree when they occurred within four hours of each other and should be treated as a single crime. The court affirmed the sentence and held that the crimes were separate crimes and that the statute applied. The court found that the statute was unambiguous and conveyed a clear and definite meaning. The statute provided a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole to a person who had a prior conviction for a most serious crime. Murder and armed robbery were included in the definition of the most serious crimes. Appellant failed to raise an equal protection claim in the trial court and, therefore, it was not preserved for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

The state was not allowed to impeach defendant with evidence of his prior convictions under S.C. R.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from an order of the Anderson County (South Carolina) Circuit Court, which suppressed evidence seized during a motor vehicle search conducted after police stopped respondent's vehicle for a perceived minor traffic violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff successfully moved to suppress evidence seized during a roadside search of his automobile and the State appealed. The suppression order was affirmed. The initial stop of plaintiff's vehicle was based upon a police officer's observation that one of the rear brake lights on plaintiff's vehicle was broken. South Carolina law required only that the vehicle have one functioning rear brake light; therefore the broken brake light did not give the officer reasonable suspicion to stop plaintiff's vehicle. Because the officer observed no other conduct that would have supported the stop, the initial stop of plaintiff's vehicle was unconstitutional, the subsequent search and seizure were &quot;fruits of the poisonous tree,&quot; and suppression of the evidence was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Suppression order affirmed. State law required only that motor vehicles have at least one functioning rear brake light.
