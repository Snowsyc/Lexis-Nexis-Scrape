<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted in a Texas trial court on six counts of aggravated sexual assault and of four counts of indecency with a child. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for each of 6 counts of aggravated sexual assault and 3 of the 4 counts of indecency, and to 20 years' imprisonment on the remaining count of indecency. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court determined that defendant's prior conviction for rape brought him under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.42(c)(2) (2003), which provided for a mandatory life sentence for certain types of repeat sexual offenders. On appeal, defendant argued that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.42(c)(2) (2003) was unconstitutional in that it constituted cruel and unusual punishment, violated his due process protections, and violated ex post facto principles. He further contended that the mandatory punishment provisions of &sect; 12.42(c)(2) did not apply to him because his prior conviction was not for an offense listed in the statute. The appellate court initially noted that with respect to defendant's constitutional arguments, it had previously decided each of those issues adversely to him. The appellate court held that with regard to the argument that defendant's prior conviction for rape was not one of the offenses listed under the statute, the list of offenses expressly set forth under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.42(c)(2)(B) also included the statutory predecessors to the offenses enumerated therein, and that aggravated rape was the predecessor to aggravated sexual assault.</SPAN></P>

Here, in a subsequent applicant for habeas corpus relief under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 11.071, &sect; 5, applicant argued that new developments affected his prior claim under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention and required the court to provide him with judicial review and reconsideration. President Bush issued a memorandum in which he stated that a decision of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), providing reconsideration of the convictions of certain Mexican nationals for actual prejudice, should be given effect in state courts in accordance with general principles of comity. The court determined that the ICJ decision and the presidential memo did not constitute new legal or factual bases requiring judicial review of applicant's claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant clubs sought review of a decision entered by the District Court of Travis County, 53rd Judicial District (Texas), which granted a plea to the jurisdiction by appellees, the administrator of the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission and the state attorney general (the State), in the clubs' action seeking a declaration that Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect; 32.03(k) (2007) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The clubs, which were sexually-oriented businesses, had sought permits in 2003 to operate as private clubs and to sell alcoholic beverages. However, the permits were denied pursuant to &sect; 32.03(k) because the clubs operated a sexually-oriented business. The clubs did not appeal the denial of the permits under Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect; 11.67 (2007) but instead brought a federal action challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 32.03(k) and then, after dismissing the federal case, brought the instant action challenging the statute's constitutionality under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 3, 8 and art. 3, &sect; 56. The State claimed that the clubs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. While the State argued additional grounds on appeal, the court could only consider the &sect; 11.67 ground raised in the plea to the jurisdiction. Section 11.67 did not apply to bar the clubs' action as they did not challenge the denial of their permit applications but were contesting the constitutionality of the statute on which the denials were based. The doctrine of exhaustion of remedies did not apply when only questions of law were involved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the lower court's decision and remanded for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner city sought review of decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fourteenth District of Texas, which dismissed its appeal, for want of jurisdiction, of a summary judgment in favor of respondent fire alarm dispatcher. The court of appeals held that Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 143.1016(j) did not afford the city a right to appeal an independent hearing examiner's decision. The court granted the city's petition for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The dispatcher, who worked for the city's fire department, was suspended for violating basic dispatch protocols. The dispatcher appealed his suspension to an independent hearing examiner. The city appealed the examiner's decision in favor of the dispatcher. The issue on appeal was whether &sect; 143.1016(j) afforded the city a right of appeal from an independent hearing examiner's decision, or whether the legislature intended the limited appeal in subjection (j) to apply exclusively to fire fighters and police officers. The court determined that the general language the legislature chose to describe the right of appeal under &sect; 143.1016(j) was deliberate and not intended to foreclose a municipality's appellate rights. Section 143.1016(j) stated generally that a district court &quot;may hear an appeal&quot; of a hearing examiner's award, specifically foreclosing the right to neither party. The court rejected the dispatcher's argument that the portions of &sect; 143.1016(c) informing fire fighters and police officers of their limited right of review on appeal would be rendered surplusage if all parties before a hearing examiner were provided the same right to appeal under &sect; 143.1016(j).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the court of appeals' judgment of dismissal and remanded the case to that court for consideration of the city's appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The 173rd Judicial District Court, Henderson County, Texas, granted summary judgments in favor of appellee Henderson County Appraisal District (HCAD) in appellant landowners' suits contesting the valuation of their real property.

There was no issue of fact regarding whether the assessed value of the property was higher than the market value of the property. The trial court did not err in granting HCAD's traditional motion for summary judgment. The case did not warrant sanctions; therefore, the appellate court declined to impose monetary sanctions under Tex. R. App. P. 45.</SPAN></P>

A state parole officer testified she read to defendant all the requirements placed on his parole, including registration as a sex offender. She also specifically stated that she told him that he would have to register with local law enforcement after release, regardless of his parole status. A surveillance officer for the board of pardons and parole testified he was present and heard her go over each and every term of the sex offender registration program. After his release, defendant was stopped and questioned by a sheriff, who instigated an investigation that ultimately discovered defendant had been convicted of a sexual offense but was not registered as a sex offender. Defendant was then arrested for failing to register. The record sufficiently proved that he had received notice of his duties under the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State of Texas sought review of an order from the 336th Judicial District Court Fannin County (Texas), which dismissed an indictment against defendant with prejudice. The indictment charged defendant with a violation of Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 822.005(a)(2) (2010) after his dog attacked a victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In its indictment against defendant, the State alleged that his dangerous dog, while not restrained in a secure enclosure, made an unprovoked attack on a victim, causing serious bodily injury, in violation of &sect; 822.005(a)(2). The trial court dismissed the indictment with prejudice on the ground that &sect; 822.005(a)(2) was unconstitutional, facially and as applied, because it failed to set forth any required culpable mental state. On appeal, the court found that &sect; 822.005(a)(2) was neither facially unconstitutional, nor was it unconstitutional as applied to defendant, because it was subject to a culpable mental state of at least &quot;recklessly.&quot; Section 822.005(a)(2) complied with the requirements of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 6.02(a), (c) (Supp. 2009). Both the plain language of &sect; 822.005(a)(2) and Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 822.042(a)(2) (2010) imposed upon the owner of a dangerous dog the duty to restrain or secure his or her animal. Accordingly, while the trial court correctly quashed the indictment for failure to allege a culpable mental state, it erred in doing so with prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court modified the judgment quashing the indictment to provide that such dismissal was without prejudice. As modified, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.011(a)(2)(A) was not constitutionally infirm under the Texas due course of law provisions, Tex. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 10, 19. Strict liability sex crimes were a valid exercise of the State's authority and rationally supported a legitimate state interest. The statute was not arbitrary and capricious because it served a reasonable state interest from protecting children from sexual assault. The statute did not violate a fundamental right because the federal constitution granted neither a fundamental right to have sex with minors, nor an absolute prohibition against strict liability criminal statutes. There was no precedent supporting defendant's claim that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 6.02 required a mens rea component in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.011(a)(2)(A).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The 371st District Court of Tarrant County (Texas) convicted defendant for possession of child pornography on his computer and in a photograph. The trial court sentenced him to 10 years' incarceration. Defendant filed a first amended motion for a new trial, which the trial court overruled. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Based on information that defendant had child pornography at his residence, the police were able to obtain a search warrant for the premises. During the search, they found and seized a photograph depicting a young girl engaged in an act of oral sex and a computer hard drive containing approximately 7,480 photographs, one movie, and approximately 1,408 stories relating to child pornography. Defendant was indicted for possession of both the computer images and the photograph. He pled guilty to both indictments. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the Texas child pornography statute,&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 43.25, 43.26 (2003), as vague and overbroad. The appellate court found that because the statute only prohibited pornography depicting actual children and not material that &quot;appears&quot; to depict children, the statute was not vague or overbroad. Also, the statute did not place the burden on defendant to prove the age of the child in the material. The statute placed that burden on the State and defendant could choose to counter the State's evidence. Thus, the statute was not unconstitutional and defendant's convictions for child pornography were proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After a bench trial, defendant was convicted of securing execution of documents by deception (SEDD), and five counts of money laundering, in the 194th Judicial District Court, Dallas County (Texas). The trial court assessed punishment for each conviction, enhanced by a prior felony conviction, at 60 years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine. Defendant was also ordered to pay restitution in an amount in excess of $ 3.6 million. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was involved in an insurance fraud scheme, in the context of viatical settlement policies, where a terminally ill person, insured by an existing life insurance policy, would sell the policy at a discount. The purchaser became the beneficiary, receiving the proceeds on the insured's death. Individuals previously diagnosed with a terminal illnesses, such as HIV-positive or AIDS patients, applied for life insurance, concealing their illnesses by falsely answering medical questions on the applications; this was known as &quot;clean sheeting.&quot; The fraudulently obtained policies were then sold to unsuspecting purchasers through defendant's viatical settlement company. The appellate court concluded that the evidence was factually sufficient to support the convictions and to corroborate the accomplice-witness testimony; the trial court had not erred in admitting certain testimony during the punishment hearing; and the SEDD statute was not unconstitutionally vague. It agreed, however, that the restitution award was improper because it was based upon the victims' expectation interest in the face value of the policies, rather than upon their actual loss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">That portion of the judgment determining the amount of restitution was vacated, and the case was remanded to the trial court so it could determine the amount of restitution to be paid to each victim. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain his conviction. The court of appeals disagreed. An undercover agent represented to defendant that she was a 13 year old girl on numerous occasions during their online chats. When defendant initiated contact with her, the agent immediately informed defendant that she was 13 years old. Throughout their online conversations, the agent repeatedly expressed concern that defendant might have a problem with her being only 13 years old. The evidence showed that, in turn, defendant repeatedly reassured the agent that her young age was not a problem and was, in fact, to him, &quot;a plus.&quot; The evidence also showed that the meeting between defendant and the agent was secretive. Defendant planned to meet the agent in a park, not at her home, and then planned to have sex with her in a motel. Defendant commented that the agent's youth would facilitate the believability of their father-daughter relationship when the two were in public together. Additionally, the court of appeals determined that &sect; 33.021 was not unconstitutionally overbroad or vague.</SPAN></P>

He argued that art. 1.15 was unconstitutional for denying his federal and state rights to compulsory process, since it prohibited him from presenting evidence. Additionally, defendant argued that the trial court committed fundamental error in proceeding to find him guilty when he did not waive his federal or state rights to compulsory process. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that: (1) art. 1.15 neither prohibited a defendant from offering evidence nor precluded the trial court from considering a defendant's evidence; and (2) neither State nor federal law required a defendant to specifically waive the right to compulsory process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant and appellee sought discretionary review of an order of the First Court of Appeals, Harris County (Texas), that applied the standard of harm contained in Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 36.19 in finding that while the charge given to the jury in the punishment phase of appellant's trial for aggravated assault denied appellant due process of law and due course of law, there was no harm to appellant from the errors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant individual was indicted for attempted capital murder. He was subsequently found guilty of aggravated assault. During the punishment phase of trial, the trial court charged the jury that appellant was eligible to earn time off the period of incarceration through the award of good conduct time. Appellant did not object to the charge. The jury assessed 15-years' imprisonment. On review, appellant argued the charge was erroneous, as the offense made him ineligible to count good conduct time toward his release. The appeals court agreed that the charge erred, but found the error harmless. The appeals court held appellant failed to show the erroneous charge resulted in such egregious harm that he did not receive a fair and impartial trial. Both appellant and appellee prosecution sought review. The court affirmed the appeals court, because it applied the correct standard of review to the error contained in the charge, given that appellant failed to object at the time the charge was given. Based on that reasoning, the court dismissed appellee's request for review as moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the order, finding that any error in the charge to the jury was harmless, and dismissed appellee's request for review as moot, because the correct standard was applied in finding that the error was harmless, in light of appellant's failure to object to the error when it was made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The applicant was sentenced to seven years in prison. He was subsequently sentenced on another offense to serve eight years beginning after completion of the first. The problem was that he was not incarcerated until the first sentence ended. He was incorrectly released to mandatory supervision. After finally being imprisoned, he was erroneously released before his second sentence began. He claimed he should be given credit on the second sentence for the time he was on release, because it was not his fault. The appellate court held that the statute that applied to him was the statute applicable to prisoners who were released on mandatory supervision when he was erroneously released. His first sentence was discharged when his period of supervision on that sentence would have expired. Then his stacked sentence for the second offense should have started, but because he was not incarcerated, the credit accrued only toward his period of supervision. Had he spent the next eight years on supervision without a violating his conditions, he would have discharged his second sentence too. However, because his supervision was revoked, he was not eligible for credit on the second sentence.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 19.02 and 19.03, in a two-paragraph indictment. The State alleged that defendant, acting together with others, caused the death of one victim in Texas, and caused the death of a second victim in Kansas. The appellate court ruled that the State had jurisdiction to prosecute defendant in Texas, and the trial court properly denied her motion to quash. The indictment alleged that defendant murdered the first victim, and thus alleged an element of the capital murder offense that had occurred in Texas. Since the State had jurisdiction to prosecute defendant for the capital murder of the first victim in Texas, the grand jury had the authority to investigate the alleged capital murder. Furthermore, read together with Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 1.04 (1994), Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(7)(B) gave defendant fair notice that she could be convicted of capital murder for murdering more than one person pursuant to the same scheme or course of conduct, if one of the murders occurred in Texas.</SPAN></P>

The complaint alleged that the guardian's ward, her daughter, underwent a lithotripsy procedure at the surgical center and suffered cardio-pulmonary arrest resulting in a permanent anoxic brain injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court found that the claims had been filed outside the limitations period of former Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i. The guardian argued that the statute of limitations violated the &quot;open courts&quot; provision of the Texas Constitution because the ward had been mentally incapacitated continuously since the incident from which her claims arose. In affirming, the court held that the guardian failed to raise a fact issue about the constitutionality of the statute of limitations for health care liability claims as applied to the ward because she failed to provide competent summary judgment evidence regarding the ward's mental capacity. The only summary judgment evidence of mental incapacity the guardian provided was two nurses' affidavits. One nurse's statement that the ward had been in a comatose, vegetative state consistently since the date of her surgery was a medical diagnosis the nurse had not shown herself qualified to render. Furthermore, there was no evidence to indicate the extent to which the nurse's opinion was based on her personal observations and to what extent she was simply relying on the opinions of others. The second nurse's affidavit was similarly flawed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The claimant sought personal injury damages arising out of an automobile accident. She initially filed her personal injury suit in bankruptcy court, filed again in federal district court when her adversary proceeding was dismissed, and then brought her suit in state court when her federal action was dismissed. The suit in state court was filed more than two years after the accident. The trial court determined that Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 16.064 (1997) did not toll limitations. The court affirmed, finding that &sect; 16.064 did not toll limitations because the factual allegations in the claimant's adversary complaint affirmatively established that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction. The court stated that personal injury suits were outside a bankruptcy court's core jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 157(b)(5) gave district courts jurisdiction over personal injury and wrongful death actions, while preserving for bankruptcy courts the jurisdiction to deal with bankruptcy-related matters. Consequently, the bankruptcy court had authority to control a debtor's disposition of a personal injury award but not the authority to adjudicate a personal injury claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The individuals brought a personal injury action against the foundation and others alleging, in part, that pesticide application was performed negligently. The foundation filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, arguing that it was entitled to sovereign immunity under Tex. Agric. Code Ann. &sect; 74.129 (2004). The trial court granted the foundation's motion and entered an order dismissing the claims against the foundation without prejudice. On appeal, the court affirmed, stating that the individuals' claim that &sect; 74.129 was unconstitutional was waived because they failed to raise the challenge in the trial court. Further, the foundation did not waive sovereign immunity under the Texas Tort Claims Act, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 101.001 et seq, because the foundation simply hired others to perform work as independent contractors. Therefore, there was no community of pecuniary interest so as to give rise to a joint enterprise.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The 252nd District Court, Jefferson County, Texas, convicted defendant of burglary of a building and forgery. The trial court deferred adjudication of guilt and placed defendant on community supervision. The State moved to adjudicate and the trial court sentenced defendant to two year terms of confinement in each case, and ordered that the sentences be served consecutively. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant complained that the trial court was unconstitutionally biased, that his trial counsel was unconstitutionally ineffective, and that the sentences imposed were unconstitutionally cruel. The appellate court noted that, pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 5(b), a defendant was entitled to a punishment hearing after the adjudication of guilt; however, this requirement was satisfied as long as the defendant had an opportunity to present evidence in mitigation of guilt, either before or after adjudication. The trial judge's comments were an articulation that defendant's explanation for his failure to complete the Substance Abuse Felony Punishment Facility program was unpersuasive. Defendant's claim of ineffectiveness of counsel concerned the trial court's reception of evidence directly affecting the decision to adjudicate. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 5(b) precluded the appellate court from addressing the issue on direct appeal. Defendant's failure to raise an Eighth Amendment claim in the trial court waived the error. The records in defendant's cases did not establish deficient performance by trial counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued the innocent-owner defense violated due process under the Texas Constitution because it required an innocent owner to prove a negative.

The appellate court found that the innocent-owner defense did not make property owners more susceptible to forfeiture. Defendant did not demonstrate that the civil-forfeiture statute violated the Texas Constitution's due process guarantees. Not only did defendant fail to explain in an affidavit or verified motion for continuance what discovery he needed and why, he did not even do note in his response to the State's summary-judgment motion. Defendant requested a remand of the cause for &quot;further factual development&quot; without appropriately proving and explaining what development was left to be done.

Fam. Code Ann.  &sect; 161.001(Q) (Vernon Supp. 2000) was unconstitutional; trial court erred in terminating his parental rights based on those grounds listed in &sect; 161.001(Q) because application of the provision was an unconstitutional ex post facto application; there was a conflict between trial court's rendition of judgment and its findings; and the evidence was factually insufficient to support termination of his parental rights. The court affirmed the decision to terminate appellant's parental rights. Appellant failed to preserve the constitutional issues raised for appellate review. Clear and convincing evidence supported the finding that appellant's conduct endangered the child's well-being. Drug use by appellant and the child's mother, evidence that the couple lived in unclean conditions, and appellant's imprisonment showed a pattern of engaging in harmful conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant challenged the order of the 383rd District Court, El Paso County (Texas), declaring Tex. Transp. Code &sect;&sect; 728.001 through 728.004&nbsp;unconstitutional and enjoining enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appeal involved a constitutional challenge to the last remaining blue law in the State of Texas. The blue law prohibited motor vehicle sales on consecutive weekends. The trial court declared the law unconstitutional and enjoined enforcement. Appellee served notice on the attorney general (AG) of the suit, but the AG declined to participate. Appellant and the attorney general later learned of the trial court's order, and belatedly took interest in the suit, filing a post-judgment motion to intervene, a motion for new trial, and a notice of appeal. The court of appeals originally held that the AG had waived the right to appeal. The supreme court reversed and remanded. On remand, the instant court held that appellant was a necessary party, and without it, the court's judgment had to be vacated. Moreover, appellee should have known this fact, as its members had been fined on more than one occasion as a result of enforcement actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Judgment vacated and dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Appellant was a necessary party to the litigation. Appellee had notice that appellant had power and jurisdiction to regulate distribution, sale, and leasing of motor vehicles, as members had been fined more than once as a result of enforcement actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">An officer stopped defendant for following too closely in violation of Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect; 545.062. Defendant argued that &sect; 545.062 was not specific enough to provide notice of the conduct it prohibited and therefore that the stop was invalid. The court disagreed, finding that &sect; 545.062 was not unconstitutionally vague because compliance required only one thing: to maintain an assured clear distance while following another vehicle in order to safely stop and avoid a collision with the preceding vehicle. The court next found that the officer gave specific, articulable facts to support the reasonable suspicion that defendant had committed a traffic violation. He testified that he saw defendant's vehicle right up on another vehicle while traveling at a high rate of speed, such that defendant would not have been able to safely stop his vehicle. Finally, the court found that the seizure of the cigarette pack that contained the contraband was reasonable. The officer was justified in performing a pat-down search of defendant and the cigarette pack for weapons during the investigative detention.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant challenged a decision of the District Court of Bell County, 264th Judicial District (Texas), which revoked his community supervision, adjudicated his guilt for the offense of intentionally and knowingly causing serious mental injury to a child younger than 15 years of age, and found true five alleged violations of his community supervision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State alleged that defendant committed five violations of the terms of his community service, including assaulting his sister and making harassing phone calls. The trial court found the allegations true. Defendant argued on appeal that the revocation and adjudication were erroneous because the telephone harassment statute was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed. The evidence of defendant's assault on his sister alone was sufficient to support revocation. Defendant did not challenge that finding or the other three violations. The 15-year sentence was for the original charge offense, injury to a child, not his subsequent supervision violations that also could form the basis of separate criminal prosecution and punishment. Without addressing whether there was any error in the trial court's consideration of the telephone harassment allegation, the court held that any such error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After trial, a jury unanimously determined that the inmate suffered from a behavioral abnormality making him likely to engage in a predatory act of sexual violence. The trial court ordered him to be civilly committed for outpatient treatment upon his release from prison. On appeal, the inmate argued that Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 841 was unconstitutional because it was punitive in nature and violated basic constitutional safeguards, due process was violated when the trial court refused to submit the issue of volitional control to the jury, and that Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 841.082 was unconstitutionally vague and violated the separation of powers doctrine. The appellate court noted that defendant had failed to show by clearest proof that Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 841 was punitive in purpose or effect. The appellate court held that the instruction defendant requested was required by neither the United States Constitution nor state law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The 54th District Court, McLennan County (Texas) convicted defendant of three counts of felony aggravated sexual assault of a child. Defendant appealed, and the instant court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause for a new trial. The State sought discretionary review. The Court of Criminal Appeals reversed the instant court's judgment and remanded the cause to the instant court to address defendant's remaining issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defense counsel failed to request notice from the State of its intent to offer evidence of extraneous offenses or bad acts. Because the evidence was offered in its case-in-chief in the punishment phase, not during cross-examination or rebuttal, defendant was entitled to notice. The failure to request notice was not justifiable by sound trial strategy. Defendant showed counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. However, there was no indication in the record and defendant did not argue that counsel would have taken different steps to rebut or object to the evidence had notice been received. There was also nothing in the record to indicate that the jury might have assessed less than 30 years for each count. It was reasonably probable they would not. Therefore, the error was not so serious that it deprived defendant of a fair trial or significant enough to render counsel ineffective. Regarding defendant's argument that Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted in the 405th District Court Galveston County, Texas, for aggravated kidnapping, aggravated sexual assault, and aggravated robbery. The trial court sentenced him to 60 years' imprisonment for the kidnapping and robbery convictions, and life imprisonment for the aggravated sexual assault conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress 22 items of evidence offered in evidence at trial. He further contended that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a) was unconstitutional because it required a jury instruction regarding good conduct time even though the parole board could not consider good conduct time when determining the date on which he was eligible for release on parole. The appellate court noted that defendant's counsel stated he had no objection to the admission of 10 of the 22 items offered in evidence; thus, he failed to preserve those items for review. With respect to the remaining items of evidence, the appellate court held that given defendant's ties to the two residences and the mini-storage unit referenced in the search warrant, the issuing magistrate had a substantial basis for believing evidence might be recovered from any of those locations and did not amount to an unconstitutional fishing expedition for evidence. The appellate court concluded that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had previously thoroughly analyzed defendant's second argument and rejected it.</SPAN></P>

Dallas County (Texas), alleging insufficiency of evidence; denial of due process; denial of effective assistance of counsel; and Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A jury convicted appellant for capital murder, Tex.

The appellate court affirmed the convictions, concluding that there was legally sufficient evidence to support appellant's conviction, notwithstanding that appellant did not anticipate the murder merely because murders did not always result from armed robberies. The appellate court further rejected appellant's argument that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to certain questions because the record did not demonstrate counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. Last, the appellate court held that the penal statute provision did not violated U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants, owners of unclaimed property, sought review of a summary judgment from the District Court of Travis County, 353rd Judicial District (Texas), which denied class certification and dismissed a suit alleging that the failure of appellee, the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, to pay interest when returning the unclaimed property was an unconstitutional taking under U.S. Const. amend. V and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 17, 19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owners initially obtained a partial summary judgment in their favor. The Comptroller's motion for rehearing was denied, and the case proceeded to a hearing on class certification. At that hearing, the trial court determined that the owners had not asserted a viable takings claim, denied the motion to certify the class, and dismissed the suit. The court concluded that the trial court exercised its authority to reconsider the partial summary judgment and did not improperly rule on the viability of the suit when considering class certification under Tex. R. Civ. P. 42. The court held that Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect; 74.304(a), which provided that the state was responsible for the safekeeping of unclaimed property, and Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect; 74.601(d), (e), which instructed the Comptroller to invest unclaimed property prudently, did not create a trust relationship with the owners. Investment under the Texas Unclaimed Property Act, Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 72.001- 74.710 (1995 &amp; Supp. 2005), was for the benefit of the state, not the owners. No unconstitutional taking occurred because the state was not required to compensate the owners for the consequences of their own neglect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the district court's summary judgment, its denial of class certification, and its dismissal of the suit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant shot his pregnant wife, and both the wife and unborn child died.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The reviewing court found that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 1.07(a)(26) (Supp. 2007), defining an individual to included an unborn child, did not violate the Establishment Clause, and did not violate the Eighth Amendment as applied to defendant. Defendant's Eighth Amendment argument was based on the potential imposition of the death penalty, but the State did not seek the death penalty. The court also held that the evidence was factually sufficient to prove that defendant acted with actual awareness that his conduct was reasonably certain to cause the unborn child to fail to be born alive. On the night of the shooting, defendant stated that his wife was three-months pregnant, and there was testimony that he had been a military nurse for 20 or 30 years and that a fetus at that gestational age could not survive outside the womb. Defendant was not entitled to a charge on voluntary conduct because voluntariness was not raised, even if he did not intend to shoot his wife when he backhanded her with the hand holding the gun. His statement to that effect raised the issue of intent, not voluntariness under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 6.01(a) (2003).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sought review of the decision of the County Court at Law Number Three, Ford Bend County (Texas), which convicted him of stalking in violation Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A jury convicted defendant of the class A misdemeanor offense of stalking. Defendant appealed that conviction and the court reversed the judgment, remanding the cause. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the law of stalking. Specifically, he complained that the application paragraphs erroneously set out as different acts, each of which could have independently constituted the offense of stalking, what should have been charged as necessary elements of the single offense of stalking. He argued that those elements should have been charged conjunctively, as required for all necessary elements of one offense, rather than disjunctively, as allowed for different acts each of which constituted a separate offense. He further reasoned that the disjunctive charge improperly allowed him to be convicted by non-unanimous verdict. The State conceded reversible on that issue. The court further stated that a jury rationally could have concluded that defendant either knew or should have known that the victim would have regarded his conduct as threatening bodily injury or death to her.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A jury for the District Court of Travis County, 299th Judicial District (Texas), found defendant, the operator of a vehicle involved in an accident resulting in the injury and death of a person, guilty of failing to stop and of failing to render reasonable assistance to the victim. The trial court assessed defendant's punishment, enhanced by a prior felony conviction, at imprisonment for 14 years. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Although the victim intentionally jumped from defendant's moving vehicle, defendant was involved in an accident and should have stopped to render assistance to her. Because defendant intentionally failed to stop and failed to render reasonable assistance to the victim when it was apparent that her injuries required medical treatment, as required by Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 550.021, .023, the appellate court found that the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of failing to stop and of failing to render reasonable assistance to the victim. Although the appellate court found that the trial court's language noting that defendant pled not guilty to the charged offense and not true to the enhancement paragraph of the indictment was bothersome and should not have been used, the appellate court did not believe that the trial court's assessment of punishment was in any way influenced by defendant's exercise of his constitutional rights. Thus, the sentence was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant corporation appealed from a final judgment of the 171st District Court of El Paso County, Texas, on a bond forfeiture. The trial court remitted 50 percent of the $ 10,000 bond and awarded judgment to appellee State of Texas for $ 5,000 plus court costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court concluded that the corporation had waived any issue regarding the trial court's determination that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 22.13(a)(5) was unconstitutional because even if the corporation's brief contained neither argument or authority on the issue. Also, the corporation's request for remittitur in a trial brief filed after the final hearing but before judgment constituted a written motion as required by the statute. Further, the trial court implicitly denied the corporation's motion for full remittitur by entering only a partial remittitur. The court concluded that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 22.16(a) was invalid because it violated Tex. Const. art. 2, &sect; 1, and that the trial court did not err by failing to apply Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 22.16(a). Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by not remitting the entire amount of the bond pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 22.16(b), as there was no showing of sufficient cause or a reasonable excuse for the accused's failure to appear, and there was no evidence that the surety incurred any costs in attempting to locate the accused.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court rejected defendant's request for an instruction that he was relieved of his duty to render aid when that duty was assumed by another.

Defendant's motion for new trial, in which defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, was granted. The State appealed that decision, and the court of appeals vacated the new trial order and remanded for entry of a judgment of conviction. Defendant appealed from that judgment. The court applied the law of the case doctrine in overruling defendant's points of error regarding the sufficiency of the evidence because they were raised in the earlier appeal. Defendant's requested instruction was adequately covered by the language of the charge that the trial court gave. Defendant waived, under Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a), an &quot;as applied&quot; challenge to the constitutionality of Tex. Transp.

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.092(b)(3). The appellate court construed defendant's argument to mean that the animal cruelty statute violated the First Amendment, because it interfered with the free exercise of his religious beliefs. Because defendant did not attack the facial constitutionality of the statute, he was required to preserve any error concerning application of the statute or it was waived. Defendant urged the jury to consider his religious beliefs, but he never argued to the court or requested a ruling on the constitutionality of the statute. Nor did his motion for new trial challenge the constitutionality of the statute. Consequently, defendant failed to preserve his claim for appellate review under Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to transfer venue, denying his motion to declare the capital murder statute unconstitutional, admitting some evidence and excluding other evidence, and failing to instruct the jury on the lesser offense of murder. The appellate court found that the jury could infer that defendant was aware that his conduct of shooting his parents was reasonably certain to cause their deaths. The State provided three witnesses from the county who testified that defendant could receive a fair trial. Defendant did not provide legal authority to support his contention that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.31(a) was unconstitutional. The photograph of the victims before their death was admissible, as it allowed the jury to have a mental impression of the victims. Defendant's statements to his brother after his parents' death were not admissible, as, at the time the trial court ruled on the State's objection, defendant did not invoke the present sense impression or argue as to why the statements were admissible. Defendant waived his argument that he was entitled to an instruction on the lesser-included offense of murder.</SPAN></P>

He represented to the trial court that he was aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, and knowingly and intelligently asserted the right to self-representation. To that end, the trial court complied with defendant's repeated requests, and after conducting a hearing on defendant's motions to represent himself at trial, ordered that defendant be allowed to proceed pro se at his trial on the merits, and that his appointed attorney serve only as standby counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted in connection with the inappropriate touching of the victim, the 12-year-old son of defendant's girlfriend. The court affirmed on appeal. A juror's comments did not show that he was biased or prejudiced against any law applicable to the case, for purposes of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.16(c) (2006). Defendant failed to show that counsel's performance in not striking this juror was deficient and it was not shown that the failure to strike was not a valid trial strategy, such that the court rejected defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Although defendant argued that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.08(a) was unconstitutional, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had previously ruled that the statute was not an unconstitutional delegation of authority, and since there had been no change in the statute material to the appeal since certain cases were decided, the court was bound by the high court's holdings. The record failed to show that defendant presented his motion for a new trial to the trial court or that he requested a hearing; thus, he was not entitled to a hearing on the motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Criminal District Court No. 7, Dallas County, Texas, that convcited him of violating the requirements of his civil commitment as a sexually violent predator (SVP) under Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 841.085(a) (2010), arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion to quash the indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The district court did not err in denying defendant's motion to quash the indictment because the Sexually Violent Predators Act was not unconstitutionally vague just because it gave the trial court leeway to fashion restrictions tailored to the particular SVP facing commitment. The terms of Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 841.082(a) were set forth in the commitment order, giving the SVP specific notice of what conduct was punishable. Thus, even though the Act permitted some discretion in tailoring a commitment order for the individual SVP, the Act was not vague in its specific requirements. However, the court agreed with defendant that the judgment was inaccurate and should be reformed pursuant to Tex. R. App. P. 43.2(b). Defendant was convicted of violating his civil commitment under Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 841.085(a) by failing to submit to GPS tracking and by changing his residence without authorization, and that offense was a third-degree felony pursuant to Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 841.085(b). However, the district court's judgment indicated that defendant was convicted under Tex. Penal Code &sect; 62.10 and was convicted of a second-degree felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The district court's judgment was modified to reflect that defendant was convicted under Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 841.085(a), a third-degree offense. The judgment was also modified to reflect that defendant pled true to one enhancement paragraph and the trial court's finding of true on the punishment enhancement. As modified, the district court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant pled nolo contendre to the offense of sexual assault of a child. On appeal, defendant challenged the State's failure to allege and prove he knew the victim was under the age of seventeen. Defendant also argued that the absence of a culpable mental state with regard to the victim's age made the statute under which he was charged unconstitutionally vague, deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right to present a meaningful defense, and violated the due course of law provisions of the Texas Constitution. The appellate court ruled that with regards to defendant's assertion that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 6.02 required the State to prove he knew the victim's age, defendant waived his complaint under Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a) by failing to raise the statute as a ground in support of his motion to quash. Also, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.011(a)(2)(A) did not offend Texas due course of law provisions. The statute rationally furthered the State's objective by placing the risk of mistake about the victim's age on the older, more mature person involved, and thus, conformed to the Texas Legislature's intent to preclude mistake as a defense.</SPAN></P>

The reviewing court noted that a person was ineligible for a concealed handgun permit if he had been convicted of a felony. Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 411.172(a)(3). Convicted was defined as an adjudication of guilt or an order of deferred adjudication entered against a person whether or not the imposition of the sentence was subsequently probated and the person was discharged from community supervision. An adjudication of guilt that was expunged or pardoned was not a conviction. The applicant argued that, because the order stated that he was released from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the conviction, it should have been considered a conviction under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 411.171(4). The court held that the applicant had been convicted, even if the sentence was later probated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, defendant argued his constitutional rights to compulsory process were violated, as he neither expressly waived those rights in writing nor did the State present evidence to support his plea of guilt. He further asserted his punishment of 25 years' confinement was not proportional to the offense committed, and therefore the trial court violated his constitutional rights against cruel and unusual punishment. The appellate court initially noted defendant waived his first point of error by his failure to timely appeal at the time he was placed on deferred adjudication community supervision. The appellate court held when the punishment assessed was within the range provided by statute, as was the case in defendant's trial, the punishment was not cruel or unusual; thus defendant provided no persuasive argument on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State appealed the order of the Criminal District Court No. 5 for Dallas County, Texas, granting the motion dismissing the indictment filed by appellee juvenile.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Sixteen-year-old appellee was referred to the juvenile court for the offense of murder, and the case was transferred to the criminal district court. Defense counsel argued that appellee was exposed to a greater punishment than he would have received as a juvenile without a jury's finding beyond a reasonable doubt the facts supporting the transfer. Defense counsel testified that the juvenile court process occurred without a jury, and argued that Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 54.02(c) (2002) was unconstitutional because the State sought to increase appellee's authorized punishment, contingent on facts found by a judge and not beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court ruled that the statutory scheme that required a hearing without a jury to consider transfer of a juvenile to adult criminal court did not violate the principles established by the U.S. Supreme Court Apprendi decision, as Apprendi did not apply to a juvenile court's decision to transfer jurisdiction to the criminal district court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant went to the home of the victim's grandmother and shot him twice. He then went inside and shot another person. Defendant was convicted of capital murder, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the trial court did not err by refusing to allow evidence that the murder victim had drugs in his system because any probative value that the evidence might have had was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury under Tex. R. Evid. 403. Next, the trial court did not err by permitting the State to demand that defendant give his opinion on the credibility of the State's witnesses. There was sufficient evidence to support the giving of an instruction on the doctrine of provoking the difficulty. The trial court did not err by failing to quash the indictment based on due process or equal protection. The imposition of a life sentence did not violate the right to due process based on a failure to allow mitigating evidence. Finally, it did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The complainant conceived the idea of transforming her rental property into a gift shop. Because the complainant was employed, she needed someone to oversee the transformation of the property from residential to commercial. Complainant recruited appellant for that purpose. While a partnership agreement was understood by both complainant and appellant, it was never reduced to writing. Appellant readily admitted writing checks drawn on the business account, but insisted they were for legitimate business expenses. Any funds converted for appellant's personal use were not authorized. The appellate court could not say the evidence was insufficient to establish deprivation. By appellant's own admission, appellant was not entitled to receive any funds from the partnership unless and until there was a profit. No profits had been generated when appellant wrote the complained of checks.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The District Court of Travis County, 126th Judicial District, Texas, entered a final divorce decree in relation to the same-sex marriage of appellee spouses, who were married under Massachusetts law. The trial court did not rule on the State's motion to intervene. The State appealed, asserting that Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 6.204(c) (2006) (prohibiting state actors from giving effect to same-sex marriages) deprived the trial court of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court of appeals held that the State's attempt at intervention below was untimely under Tex. R. Civ. P. 60 because it occurred after rendition of final judgment. Further, the State did not have standing under the &quot;virtual-representation&quot; doctrine to intervene on appeal because, contrary to its argument, neither spouse defended the constitutionality of &sect; 6.204(c). The fact that one spouse sought to declare the marriage void under &sect; 6.204, or in the alternative, to obtain relief under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 6.502, was not the same as defending the constitutionality of &sect; 6.204. The court declined to read an implied constitutional challenge into the petition for divorce where no such challenge was expressly raised, particularly given the potential for interpreting &sect; 6.204 in a manner that would have allowed the trial court to grant the divorce. Finally, even if the State had been a deemed party under the virtual-representation doctrine, equitable considerations weighed against allowing the State to participate on appeal. By entering into an agreed judgment, the spouses were able to settle differences as to a complex property dispute and the parent-child relationship.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant patient filed a health care liability claim against appellees, a hospital, a surgeon, his professional association, an anesthesiologist, and a certified registered nurse anesthetist. The anesthetist moved to dismiss and sever the claims against him. The District Court of Williamson County, 277th Judicial District, Texas, granted the motion and dismissed all of the patient's claims against the anesthetist. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The patient argued that the district court erred in holding that the expert reports that she served failed to comply with Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 74.351 (Supp. 2006). The instant court concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the four expert reports did not satisfy the requirements of &sect; 74.351 with respect to the anesthetist. The expert reports prepared by two nurses were inadequate because they failed to identify the anesthetist. The two expert reports that did mention the anesthetist did not sufficiently identify the standard of care applicable to the anesthetist or explain how the anesthetist breached that standard. Nothing in the record indicated that the district court acted arbitrarily or unreasonably in exercising its discretion not to allow the patient a 30-day extension to cure the deficiencies in her report. Finally, the patient's open courts argument, under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, was misguided because the patient did not prove how the provisions of &sect; 74.351 itself, as opposed to her own failure to provide an adequate report, prevented her from pursuing her claim against the anesthetist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A victim suffered serious bodily injury in an unprovoked attack by a dog allegedly owned by defendant.

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 6.03(d) (2003), for failing to secure his dog, in violation of &sect; 822.005(a)(1). The trial court quashed the indictment on the basis that the statute on which the indictment was based was unconstitutional in failing to set forth any required culpable mental state. On appeal, the court found &sect; 822.005(a)(1) to be constitutional. The court presumed that the Texas Legislature acted in a constitutionally sound fashion in drafting the statute, and the court found no evidence to the contrary. Because the indictment stated the source of defendant's duty, the fact that he was the owner of the dog, the indictment gave sufficient notice of the source of the duty to act.</SPAN></P>

The gravamen of defendant's merits argument was that the mall had become the functional equivalent of the town square such that his First Amendment right to free political speech was protected on otherwise private property. However, there was no testimonial or documentary evidence to substantiate this contention; its absence further reinforced the appellate court's conclusion that the case was not ripe for adjudication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee, the putative husband of a 17-year-old decedent, brought an heirship application and sued appellant doctor for negligence individually and as next friend of the couple's son. A jury of the County Court at Law No. 2 and Probate Court, Brazoria County, Texas, found that the couple were common-law married before the effective date of Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 2.401(a) (1998), which prohibited common-law marriage for minors. The doctor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The husband argued, and the trial court agreed, that &sect; 2.401(c), as applied to him, would have violated the retroactivity provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 because he and the decedent were parties to a valid common-law marriage before the statute became effective. The reviewing court reversed, however, finding that there was no violation of art. I, &sect; 16, because the husband had no vested right arising from the common-law marriage. The court explained that although the common-law marriage was legal at the time it was entered, it was voidable and thus not vested for purposes of retroactivity. To create a vested right, under Tex. Fam. Code &sect;&sect; 6.103 and 6.111, an event had to occur to &quot;fix&quot; the couple's right to remain married, either the decedent's reaching the age of majority or the death of either party. None of these events occurred before the effective date of Tex. Fam. Code &sect; 2.401(c) (1998). The couple's right to remain married, thus, had not become &quot;fixed&quot; or &quot;vested,&quot; and the legislature's enactment forbidding minors to be a party to a common-law marriage rendered whatever contingent expectations the husband had for the common-law marriage a nullity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant university organization challenged an order of the District Court of Travis County, 98th Judicial District (Texas), denying its plea to the jurisdiction in an action brought by appellee sport officials' association seeking to prevent the university organization from implementing its plan to begin regulating the officiating of high school varsity sports in Texas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the court held that the university organization was a governmental unit entitled to sovereign immunity under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 101.001(3) because it was required by Tex. Educ. Code Ann. &sect; 33.083(b) (2006) to implement state education policies, was granted rulemaking and enforcement powers over such policies, was subjected to extensive oversight from the legislative and executive branches under &sect; 33.083(b), and was classified under &sect; 33.083(b) as a component part of a governmental unit, the university, that was created by Tex. Const. art. VII, &sect; 10. The court held that with respect to the sport officials' association's claim of tortious interference with a contract, the association had not pleaded facts that fell under any waiver of immunity found in the Texas Tort Claims Act. The court held that because the association brought its ultra vires claims against the organization rather than a state official acting in an official capacity, the association's action was barred by sovereign immunity and therefore the trial court erred by denying the organization's plea to the jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The order was reversed and the case was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A jury of the County Criminal Court No. 1 of Denton County, Texas, found defendant guilty of assault-family violence under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.013 (Supp. 2004-05), and the trial court sentenced him to 270 days of confinement, probated. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in making a factual finding of family violence. The court disagreed, finding first that defendant had all the notice necessary to prepare for the family violence issue. The information's caption indicated a charge of &quot;assault family violence.&quot; The victim, as defendant was aware, was his fiance and they had a child together. Thus, they were within the definition of &quot;family&quot; in Tex. Fam. Code &sect; 71.003. Under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.013 (Supp. 2004-05), the trial court had no discretion in entering a family violence finding once it determined that the offense involved family violence. The court also found no merit in defendant's argument that the family violence finding should have been presented to the jury. A finding of family violence under art. 42.013, would have increased defendant's penalty, thus implicating Blakely and Apprendi, only upon a subsequent conviction for assault-family violence. Because defendant did not have a prior family-violence offense, the increase was not being applied to him and any future application was contingent on a future conviction. Thus, the constitutional argument was not ripe.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Fam. Code Ann. ch. 160.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The parties had an agreement whereby the mother would attempt to conceive a child through donor insemination with semen from the donor and that the mother would provide the primary residence for the child and the donor would have possession of the child as agreed to. The donor brought a petition to adjudicate parentage. The mother asserted that the donor lacked parental rights and standing to maintain a parentage proceeding under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 160.02 (2002). The court denied the petition and held that if the Texas Legislature or the UPA drafters had intended to exclude donors from the class of those who had standing to maintain a parentage proceeding, they easily could have excluded donors from the group of men whose paternity was to be adjudicated. The court concluded that &sect; 160.602(3) conferred standing on a man alleging himself to be the biological father of the child in question and seeking an adjudication that he was the father of that child. Because it was undisputed that the donor alleged himself to be the child's biological father and that he filed a parentage proceeding seeking an adjudication, he had standing to maintain a proceeding to adjudicate his parentage.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The cause of death in each of the three murders was determined to be blunt force trauma to the head. On appeal, defendant did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence showing that he murdered the three women. He contended, however, that the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to sustain the finding that the murders were committed pursuant to the same scheme or course of conduct, and that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(7)(B) was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him. Defendant argued that to uphold a conviction under &sect; 19.03(a)(7)(B) there had to be evidence that each murder was committed with a similar motive and in a similar way. The appeals court concluded it was appropriate to examine all the circumstances surrounding the alleged murders, rather than to focus on only the two factors emphasized by defendant. In forming intimate relationships with three middle-aged women and then killing them and disposing of their bodies in more or less the same way over the course of five years, defendant had sufficient notice his conduct was proscribed as a capital offense because it was committed pursuant to the same course of conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant pled guilty to sexual assault. Adjudication of guilt was deferred, and he was placed on community supervision for 10 years. The State moved to adjudicate guilt. Following a hearing, the 377th District Court of Victoria County, Texas, found several allegations true, revoked supervision, and assessed punishment at 18 years in confinement. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, defendant contended that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 5(b) (Vernon Supp. 2002), concerning appeal of deferred adjudication, was unconstitutional. The appellate court found that it was bound by the interpretation of the statute by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the highest court on matters of criminal law. A party could appeal only that which the legislature authorized. The legislature provided that a defendant who pleaded guilty and was placed on deferred adjudication could raise issues relating to the original plea proceeding only in an appeal taken when the trial court first ordered deferred adjudication and imposed community supervision. If the defendant did not exercise his right to appeal at that time, no appeal could be taken from a subsequent determination to proceed with an adjudication of guilt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The appeal was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant challenged the revocation of his probation from the 382nd Judicial District Court, Rockwall County (Texas) and conviction for possession of methamphetamine, arguing his sentence violated the Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 12101-12213, and the federal and Texas constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant pleaded guilty to possession of methamphetamine and was placed on probation. Subsequently, the State filed a motion to revoke, arguing he did not report to his probation officer, changed his employment and residence without notification, did not pay his fine, and did not perform community service. The trial court found three of the allegations were proven, revoked appellant's probation, and sentenced him to serve a prison term. Appellant challenged his revocation, arguing his sentence violated the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 12101-12213, and was unconstitutional. Specifically, he asserted he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and imprisoning him would have been unfair and possibly unconstitutional while he was suffering from a mental illness. The court noted appellant's lawyer alluded at trial to the possibility of the constitutional issue in an oblique manner, but that reference was insufficient to preserve the matter for appeal. The court affirmed, holding because appellant did not raise his complaints in the trial court, he thereby waived the opportunity to do so on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Judgment affirmed, because defense counsel only alluded to the possibility of a constitutional issue obliquely in her final argument of the punishment phase of the hearing. Therefore, because appellant did not raise his complaints in the trial court, he thereby waived the opportunity to do so on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed a judgment of the 347th District Court of Nueces County, Texas, revoking his community supervision, adjudicating him guilty of two counts of sexual assault of a child and one count of indecency with a child, and sentencing him to ten years' imprisonment on each count with all sentences to run concurrently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the court held that Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

The court rejected defendant's contention that his sentence violated his constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment because it fell within the punishment range for second-degree felonies under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.33(a) and because defendant failed to preserve the issue for review, as he did not object at the time of sentencing or in any post-trial motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant, an individual designated as a vexatious litigant, sought review of an order from the 192nd Judicial District Court, Dallas County (Texas), which dismissed his suit alleging conspiracy and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims against appellee, a judge who had decided a previous case adversely to him, after making the vexatious litigant order and requiring security that was not posted by the stated deadline.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The alleged events were outside the limitations period. The trial court identified five suits made within the past five years and determined adversely. One was a bill of review proceeding. Two others were filed as a trustee and, prior to disbarment, as an attorney. The court held that the requirements for a vexatious litigant determination under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 11.054(1) (2002) were met because there was no reasonable probability of success and all five cases counted. Alleged new evidence did not toll the limitations period because it was not really new. A bill of review proceeding was subject to &sect; 11.054(1), as were cases filed by a trustee or attorney. A vexatious litigant designation could be made whether a litigant was represented by counsel or not, and there was no equal protection violation. A vagueness claim lacked merit because it was possible to determine whether there was a reasonable probability of prevailing. An open courts argument under Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 13 lacked merit because the restrictions were reasonable. Because the litigation was stayed under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 11.052(a) (2002), there were no deemed admissions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant estate representative challenged a decision of the 5th Judicial District Court (Texas), which dismissed his health care liability lawsuit filed against appellees, a doctor and a hospital, under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 74.351(b)(1), (2) (2001) and awarded the doctor and hospital attorney fees. The doctor and hospital sought damages for a frivolous appeal under Tex. R. App. P. 45.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">When the deadline for serving an expert report passed without the representative filing a report, the trial court dismissed the lawsuit. The court affirmed on appeal. The representative's constitutional claim was not raised in the trial court and was not subject to review on appeal under Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a). However, it was without merit in any event. The representative's expert report was not served until 10 days after the deadline had passed. Because the representative failed to serve his report by the deadline, and no agreed extension was obtained, mandatory dismissal was required under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 74.351(b)(1), (2), as &sect; 74.351(c) did not apply to a report filed beyond the deadline. The court affirmed the award of attorney fees awarded to the doctor, given that (1) the representative did not object to the doctor's proof, (2) the award of fees was supported by credible evidence, (3) the proof established a reasonable rate for representation, (4) those rates were not challenged, and (5) 36 hours spent on a medical malpractice case was not excessive. The court also found the evidence to support the award of fees to the hospital.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant argued that due process required knowledge of the victim's age under Tex. Penal Code Ann.  &sect; 22, because of the statute's plain language, and the severity of the punishment. Appellant personally confronted the underage victim and could have learned her true age. The majority rule in the United States was that the appellant's knowledge of the victim's age was not an essential element of statutory rape, and that such an exclusion did not violate due process. Tex. Penal Code Ann.  &sect; 22.011 did not violate appellant's constitutional due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Judgment affirmed. Statutory rape statute was not an unconstitutional violation of appellant's due process rights, even though appellant's knowledge of the victim's age was not an essential element of the crime.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued he should not be convicted of capital murder when the remuneration alleged was insurance proceeds. In his view, a capital murder conviction required a principal, agent, and victim. A person commits murder for remuneration where the actor kills to receive a benefit or financial settlement paid upon the victim's death, such as proceeds of an insurance policy. The court affirmed the judgment. Appellant had not shown how a continuance and expert testing of the hair samples would have changed the trial's outcome. Appellant had not explained how the requested testimony could have changed the outcome of this trial. Because appellant did not seek a continuance, he waived any Brady complaint. The evidence was factually sufficient to support appellant's conviction, any reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant killed the deceased for the insurance proceeds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant patient sought review of a judgment of the 221st District Court of Montgomery County (Texas), which granted the State's civil petition to commit him as a sexually violent predator (SVP) under Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 841.001-.150 (2003 and Supp. 2005).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The patient argued that the SVP statute, the judgment, and the civil commitment requirements were overly broad and vague.

Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 841.082(d) (Supp. 2005) was void for vagueness. The patient's blanket assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination was impermissible. In civil cases, the privilege had to be asserted on a question-by-question basis.

A jury found that defendant suffered from a behavioral abnormality that made him likely to engage in a predatory act of sexual violence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A doctor testified that he evaluated defendant and diagnosed pedophilia. It was his opinion that defendant had a behavior abnormality that made him likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence. Psychological tests placed defendant at an 88 percent chance to reoffend. Defendant claimed the State failed to prove that he had a serious difficulty controlling his behavior. The court overruled this claim based on the doctor's testimony. Defendant also argued the sexually violent predator statute was punitive in nature and violated basic constitutional safeguards. The court overruled this issue. Defendant then contended his privilege against self-incrimination was violated when the court ordered him to submit to polygraph examinations. The court rejected this argument. Defendant also claimed his privilege against self-incrimination was violated at trial when the doctor revealed facts obtained from him during an interview. However, counsel did not object to the evidence when it was introduced at trial. Therefore, defendant's claim presented nothing for review.</SPAN></P>

The son's petition also included a request for a partition of the property. After the 1st District Court, Jasper County, Texas, granted summary judgment in favor of the attorney, the son appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">It was undisputed the son was born to his biological father out of wedlock. The father and his mother had purchased as co-tenants two tracts of land; each owned a 50 percent undivided interest in the property. Many years later, the father's mother conveyed her interest in the two tracts of land to the son and another woman. The purchase gave the son a 25 percent interest in the two tracts of land. Subsequently, the father died. His widow conveyed by deed all of her undivided 25 percent interest in the two tracts to the attorney. In another deed, the widow conveyed all of her undivided interest in the real property to the attorney. The appeals court found that the son, as a biological son, was entitled to inherit from his father as a matter of law. By its own terms, the residual four-year statute of limitations did not apply to the son's lawsuit. While the attorney's answer set forth the adverse possession statutes as barring the son's claim, those statutes were not the basis for his motion for summary judgment or their response to the son's motion for summary judgment, and, therefore, were not before the appeals court. The son's motion for summary judgment was not granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed, finding first that the State's motion alleged that defendant, by failing to complete the drug abuse program in question, violated the terms of his community supervision order. The State's allegation directly related to the trial court's decision to adjudicate guilt, not to the sentence imposed. And because former art. 42.12, &sect; 5(b) applied to this case, the appellate court did not have jurisdiction to address this issue. Further, because the right to appeal was not constitutionally guaranteed, the legislature's decision not to provide such a right in deferred adjudication proceedings under former art. 42.12, &sect; 5(b) was not unconstitutional. Finally, because defendant's ineffective assistance claims pertained to the trial court's decision to adjudicate guilt, they were not appealable under former art. 42.12, &sect; 5(b).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to affirmatively link him to the manufacture of, or the custody or control of, the methamphetamine. The court disagreed. The fact that a drug laboratory was on defendant's premises, that he resided in a nearby mobile home, that the laboratory was linked to the residence by a power line, that chemical receptacles and burn piles were located on the property, and that both defendant and the residence smelled of the distinctive methamphetamine odor were sufficient to establish his guilt. Because there was evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that defendant was guilty as a principle, it was not necessary for the State to rely on the law of parties to convict him. With regard to the refusal to grant defendant's challenge of jurors for cause, the court agreed with the State that although two venire members initially expressed reservations about the presumption of innocence, they were not shown to be biased against the law on the presumption. Defining &quot;controlled substance&quot; in Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.002(5) to include adulterants and dilutants was not unconstitutionally vague in violation of due process.</SPAN></P>

The owner also challenged the denial of his motion to strike the city's expert testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owner brought an action against the city, challenging the constitutionality of a sexually-oriented business ordinance, El Paso, Tex., Ordinance No. 016624 (May 8, 2007). The city moved for summary judgment on the ground that the ordinance was a constitutional regulation of the time, place, and manner in which sexually-oriented businesses had to operate in the city. The trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court found that because the city's predominant purpose in enacting the ordinance was unrelated to the suppression of expression under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. amend. I, the ordinance was content-neutral. The ordinance was a constitutional restriction on symbolic speech. The ordinance strived to target secondary effects while leaving substantially intact the quantity and accessibility of speech. The ordinance's incidental restriction on First Amendment freedoms was no greater than was essential to the furtherance of the important or substantial government interest. Further, the trial court did not err in denying the owner's motion to strike the opinions of the city's experts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On review, the next friend contended the trial court erred in granting the administrators' motion for summary judgment as the limitations period had not expired. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the summary judgment evidence showed that the date of the tort was readily ascertainable: the affidavit indicated that the patient's treatment began on the day the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was made; it did not indicate that any negligence occurred beyond that date. This was the last date that any failure to diagnose or treat the patient's diabetes could have occurred. And since the original petition was filed more than two years and 75 days after this date, the trial court correctly determined that the two-year statute of limitations period under former Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (current version at Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 74.251(a) (2005)) barred the commencement of suit in this case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In 1998, appellant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance while in a correctional facility and was sentenced to fifty years' imprisonment. In 2004, appellant filed the instant case. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in granting the motion and dismissing his suit for want of jurisdiction because his suit was not attacking his 1998 conviction, over which only the Fort Bend County Court could exercise jurisdiction. The appellate court found that although appellant argued that he was not attacking his 1998 conviction but instead seeking declarations that the special prison prosecution unit was unconstitutional, in his original petition, appellant asked the trial court to issue a declaration that all actions taken by the unit in its prosecution of him were void. This was in essence an attack on the validity of his 1998 conviction, which had to be undertaken through a habeas corpus proceeding. The trial court properly found that it lacked jurisdiction over appellant's complaints, because he sought relief from a final felony conviction from a court that lacked jurisdiction over the issue.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court ruled that it could not rule on the case because defendant's general notice of appeal failed to adhere to the requirements of Tex. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A trial judge issued an injunction enjoining defendant and other members of a gang from engaging in various activities. Defendant was later charged with violating the injunction. Defendant moved to dismiss the charges, claiming that the &quot;reasonable requirements&quot; language in Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 125.065(a)(2) violated the separation of powers doctrine in Tex. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 because it allowed judges to make laws that could be sanctioned under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 71.021. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss. Defendant pled guilty to the charges. The court of appeals held that there was no violation of the separation of powers doctrine. On review, the court determined that the court of appeals did not err in holding that &sect; 125.065, when sanctioned through &sect; 71.021, did not violate the separation of powers doctrine. The Texas Legislature had established a policy and set forth a primary fixed standard. A provision that prohibited defendant from making gang hand signs and wearing gang clothing did not violate his right to free speech and was not unconstitutionally vague. Although the provision was content-based, the strict scrutiny standard was met.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant pled guilty to delivery of a controlled substance. The 90th District Court of Young County, Texas, placed her on seven years' deferred adjudication community supervision and fined her $2,500. Because appellant violated conditions of her community supervision, the trial court adjudicated her guilt on the State's motion, sentenced her to twenty years' confinement, and fined her $2,500. She appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In her sole point, appellant claimed that her due process rights under Tex. Const. art. article I, &sect;&sect; 19 and 29, were violated when her community supervision was revoked and she was adjudicated guilty under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 5(b) (2006). Specifically, appellant claimed that the statute was facially unconstitutional because it limited the right of appeal in cases involving deferred adjudication. The appellate court had previously determined that the statutory denial of the right to appeal as set forth in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 5(b) (2006), was not facially unconstitutional, and it declined to reconsider its prior holdings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants challenged a decision from the District Court of Travis County, 331st Judicial District, Texas, which denied their pretrial application for a writ of habeas corpus challenging the constitutionality of former Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 34.01 (current version at Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 34.02 (Supp. 2007)). The State filed a motion for rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants contended that the former money laundering statute was unconstitutionally vague. Pretrial habeas corpus relief was denied, and a decision was rendered on appeal. The State then filed a motion for rehearing. In denying that motion, the appellate court determined that appellants were mounting a facial challenge. Moreover, even if issues were raised that were not cognizable on pretrial habeas, the appellate court had to address those issues that were raised and necessary to the resolution of the appeal. A party making a facial vagueness challenge had to demonstrate that there was no set of circumstances under which a statute would be valid, starting with the complainant's conduct. As such, an examination of whether the term &quot;funds&quot; included checks was required by controlling United States Supreme Court precedent. An examination of legislative history was appropriate because of the ambiguity of the definition of the word &quot;funds.&quot; The Texas Legislature chose not to include checks within the scope of the term &quot;funds&quot; when defining money laundering in 1993. Accordingly, the money-laundering statute, as enacted prior to 2005, was not vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The motion for rehearing was denied. The original opinion was not withdrawn.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city adopted a regulation amending all specific use permits to automatically terminate if the activity allowed under the permit ceased for six months, regardless of the owner's intention. Then it adopted regulations providing that alcoholic beverages would only be allowed in restaurants with certain square footage. Thereafter, the joint venture purchased property and was denied a new alcoholic beverage permit because the property had not sold alcoholic for more than six months. The joint venture appealed, arguing the regulations were preempted by the TABC, and the denial of the permit constituted a regulatory taking. The appellate court dispensed with the first argument, holding the legislature enacted a validating statute providing that all governmental acts and proceedings of a municipality since its incorporation or attempted incorporation were validated as of the dates on which they occurred. The appellate court concluded the city had already adopted the challenged regulations that extinguished specific use permits when the joint venture purchased its property; thus, the regulations did not interfere with its investment-backed expectation regarding the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After their father died while under the doctor's care, the brothers filed wrongful death and survival claims. The brothers' attorney died unexpectedly, and a motion to dismiss was later filed by the doctor due to a failure to comply with Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 74.351(a) (2008). The motion was granted, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court rejected the argument that &sect; 74.351(a), (b) violated the brothers' rights under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. This provision acted as an additional due process guarantee, which prohibited legislative bodies from withdrawing all legal remedies to anyone having a well-defined common law cause of action. Even though a suit for medical negligence was recognized at common law, a personal injury claim did not survive an injured party's death, nor did a decedent's heirs have a common law cause of action for their own losses. The actions were permitted under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 71.002-.004, 71.021 (2008). Because the remedies sought were statutory, Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 did not apply to this case. Finally, the case of Rankin was distinguishable.</SPAN></P>

The court then filed an amended order that elaborated on its findings and stated that the previous order did not reflect the full ruling of the court but the amended order did. Two days after the amended order was signed, the State appealed the trial court's original order granting appellee's motion to quash. In dismissing the State's appeal, the court held that the trial court's statements in the amended order that the amended order reflected the court's full ruling illustrated the trial court's intent to replace the first order with the amended order. Thus, because the first order was presumptively vacated by the later order, the court held that the first order from which the State specifically appealed was not an appealable order and presented nothing for the court's review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the 351st District Court, Harris County (Texas), which convicted him of possession of a chemical dispensing device, namely an aerosol can containing the pepper spray oleoresincapsicum, in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 46.05(a)(8) (2002), revoked his probation for filing a false report, and adjudicated him guilty of a prior offense for impersonating a public servant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">As a condition of probation, defendant was required to surrender all police-related equipment and to refrain from acquiring additional police-related equipment. Defendant was arrested for outstanding warrants, and an inventory search of his car revealed a can of pepper spray and other police-related equipment. The appellate court upheld the district court's actions, as: (1) the issue as to improper search and seizure was not properly preserved for appeal, in that the error alleged on appeal did not comport with the objection made at trial; (2) the issue as to the unconstitutionality of the statute was not properly preserved for appeal, in that it was not raised in the trial court; (3) the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support defendant's conviction of possession of pepper spray, in that the spray was the kind that was only sold to police officers; (4) the evidence was legally sufficient to support probation revocation, in that defendant did not contest the possession of the police-related items; and (5) the appellate court had no jurisdiction over an adjudication of guilt on an original charge that was previously suspended, as it was not appealable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed from an order of the 262nd District Court, Harris County, Texas, which granted his petition for writ of habeas corpus to the extent of holding a hearing, but that court ultimately denied relief and upheld the constitutionality of the Sexual Offender Registration Program (SORP), Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. ch. 62 (Supp. 2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged with indecency with a child and was placed on community supervision with a deferred adjudication, for which he was required to register as a sex offender pursuant to Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. &sect; 62.02(a) (Supp. 2002). He sought a writ of habeas corpus based on charges stemming from his failure to comply with the SORP, pursuant to Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. &sect; 62.10 (Supp. 2002). The court found that defendant failed to establish a liberty or property interest to his reputation that was protected by U.S. Const. XIV against state action. It was noted that he could not establish a defamatory state action in order to meet the &quot;stigma plus&quot; test, as the dissemination of information by the state agencies was truthful. Defendant's claim that the SORP registration requirements violated the Eighth Amendment lacked merit, as registration was not considered &quot;punishment.&quot; The slight impediments placed on defendant's right to travel were found to be rationally related to a legitimate state purpose. The SORP scheme was not found to be void for vagueness, as Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. &sect; 62.04(a) was sufficiently explicit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant complained for the first time on appeal that his constitutional rights were violated because the sentence imposed by the trial court was cruel, unusual, and grossly disproportionate to the offense committed.

Because defendant failed to object to the proportionality of a sentence that was not unconstitutional per se, his argument was waived. In any event, the sentence of 20 years was well within the statutory range and, in fact, well below the maximum of 99 years or life imprisonment for a habitual felony offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">County health department officers received a complaint regarding trash and junk strewn about the property where defendant lived. Inspectors and deputy constables went to the property to serve defendant with notice of the problem and the need to abate the problem. When defendant did not answer his front door, one deputy constable walked to the back door to knock and found a pool of sewage on the property. One inspector removed a soil sample without a search warrant or defendant's consent. On appeal, the court found that (1) the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress the evidence because the evidence was obtained from an open area of the curtilage and was discovered while a deputy constable was walking through the curtilage to knock on the back door and not for the purpose of conducting a search; (2) the trial court did not err in taking judicial notice of a statutory interpretation made by the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas and instructing the jury that a drainage ditch fell within the definition of waters in the state; (3) the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction; and (4) Tex. Water Code Ann.  &sect; 7.145 was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged in the 400th District Court, Fort Bend County, (Texas) with attempted display of harmful material to a minor and 43 counts of possession of child pornography. The court granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by granting defendant's motion to suppress because there was probable cause for the magistrate to issue the search warrant. The court of appeals agreed. Based on the search warrant affidavit, it was reasonable for the magistrate to conclude that the offense of distribution of harmful materials to a minor occurred. The communications and exchanges between defendant and an agent posing as a young girl set forth in the affidavit demonstrated that defendant distributed harmful materials to the investigator. The fact that the 13-year-old did not exist, but was rather being portrayed by an adult male agent, was a factual condition unknown to defendant; it did not make the commission of the offense legally impossible. It was reasonable for the magistrate to conclude that a computer was the instrumentality of the crime. It was also reasonable to infer that the commission of the offense occurred at defendant's home. Defendant identified himself by name and sent a photograph of himself to the &quot;girl.&quot; He also provided &quot;her&quot; with his cell phone and pager numbers--information that was ultimately traced back to his home address.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court concluded that the trial court did not err in admitting the testimony of a sexual assault nurse examiner pursuant to Tex. R. Evid. 803(4). The nurse examiner testified that the victim was informed about the purpose for the exam and the process of the exam. The nurse examiner testified that the victim understood the physical examination was being performed because of what happened to her. The victim was 16-years-old at the time the nurse examiner examined her, and the nurse examiner explained the entire process to her before obtaining the history of what happened. The nurse examiner also testified regarding the manner in which the history guided her examination and the reasons the history was pertinent to her medical examination. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that a proper predicate was laid for the admission of the nurse examiner's testimony. Although defendant challenged the constitutionality of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.011 because it does not contain a mens rea element, the court rejected defendant's challenge. The court continued to follow existing precedent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The city filed a de facto plea to the jurisdiction based on governmental immunity, which the trial court granted. On appeal, the tenant and the property owner argued that the trial court erred in granting the city's plea to the jurisdiction, or, in the alternative, prematurely granted the plea. The appellate court noted that, based on the current state of the law in Texas, the trial court erred by granting the city's plea to the jurisdiction regarding the inverse condemnation and nuisance claims. However, while the appellate court agreed that the sewage was discharged in such a way as to violate Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 341.011(5) (2001), the city could not be held liable for a nuisance per se based upon a violation of the statute alone, as the acts of the government were not nuisances per se.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On review, the appellate court held that the stalking statute was not unconstitutionally vague on its face because its phrase &quot;pursuant to the same scheme or course of conduct&quot; gave a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what was prohibited and established determinate guidelines for law enforcement. The appellate court also found that the only evidence in the record tending to disprove that defendant committed the offense of stalking was her own testimony which the jury was free to, and did, disbelieve. Therefore, the verdict was not so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust. The appellate court concluded that a rational trier of fact could have found each and every essential element of the offense of stalking beyond a reasonable doubt and that considering the totality of the circumstances and the pattern of behavior exhibited by defendant, a reasonable person would also have been placed in fear of bodily injury or death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted in the 175th Judicial District Court, Bexar County, Texas, on two counts of bribery and one count of money laundering. The trial court sentenced him to 12 years' confinement on each count of bribery and 10 years' confinement on the money laundering count, and fined him $ 10,000 on each count. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that the prosecutor violated his right to counsel by making improper arguments to the jury, that the money laundering statute was facially unconstitutional, that the Double Jeopardy Clause was violated in his case, and that the trial court erred in failing to declare a mistrial because the prosecutor's argument was an impermissible comment on his right not to testify. The appellate court noted that defendant failed to show trial court error because he failed to object in, and obtain a ruling from, the trial court with regard to his Sixth Amendment argument. The appellate court held that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 34.02(a)(1) (2003) required that a person know the proceeds were derived from criminal activity; thus, it was not facially unconstitutional. The appellate court further held that because bribery and money laundering each required proof of a fact that the other did not, multiple punishments arising out of the same criminal conduct were not constitutionally prohibited. The appellate court concluded that the prosecutor's impermissible comment was not so prejudicial that it was not cured by the trial court's prompt instruction to disregard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Criminal appellant was charged with three misdemeanor violations of a Houston city ordinance regulating sexually-oriented businesses. The store where he worked had been licensed as an adult bookstore under a previous ordinance. When the ordinance was amended, the store notified the city it was converting to a store that was not primarily sexually-oriented. Surveillance visits were made to the store and appellant was charged with the violations because, contrary to the store's representations, its primary business involved adult, pornographic material. Appellant was the store's manger. A jury convicted him. He appealed. The court affirmed. The court held the evidence was legally sufficient to convict appellant of the ordinance violations because testimony established he was the manager and the store dealt mainly in pornographic material. The court also held the definitions in the relevant ordinance were not vague or overbroad. Finally, it also held appellant's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee claimant filed suit against appellant Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts under Tex. Prop. Code Ann. ch. 74. The Comptroller filed a plea to the jurisdiction, which was denied by the 419th Judicial District Court of Travis County, Texas. The Comptroller appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In May 2005, the claimant received notice that the Comptroller was holding 155,387 shares of the claimant's stock in a corporation, which the Comptroller had received as unclaimed property in May 2003. In November 2005, the claimant sent a letter to the Comptroller claiming the stock and instructing the Comptroller not to sell the stock. In January 2006, the Comptroller notified the claimant that all shares of the stock had already been sold in 2004. The parties did not dispute that a second sale in February 2006 of the remaining 83,887 shares took place three months after the Comptroller received the claim for all shares and its instructions not to sell the stock. The appellate court ruled that the trial court erred in denying the Comptroller's plea to the jurisdiction with respect to the claims under Tex. Prop. Code Ann. ch. 74. Also, the trial court did not err in denying the Comptroller's plea to the jurisdiction with respect to the constitutional takings claim based on the Comptroller's failure to promptly return the 83,887 shares, her prolonged retention of the proceeds from its sale, and her continued retention of the interest earned thereon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The portion of the trial court's order pertaining to the claims under the Texas Property Code, for violation of due process and Fourth Amendment seizure were reversed and those claims were dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, and the order was affirmed as to the takings claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee developer sought to develop certain property it owned, and submitted a plat to appellee city planning commission for approval. After receiving approval, appellee city planning commission decided to reconsider the decision and appellee developer filed suit seeking, inter alia, a declaratory judgment. Appellant intervenors, property owners adjacent to appellee developer, filed a plea in intervention, and a plea in bar and abatement, contending appellant developer was not a legal entity, could not have been a party to a suit, and that the suit be dismissed. The trial court granted appellee developer's motion for partial summary judgment on the declaratory judgment claim, declaring the plat approved as a matter of law. The trial court denied intervenors' plea in bar and abatement. Appellant intervenors appealed. The court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The trial court's partial summary judgment and its subsequent orders did not dispose of all the claims in the case; therefore there was no final judgment from which appeal could have been taken.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant entered an open plea of guilty in the 94th District Court of Nueces County (Texas) to one count of indecency with a child and three counts of sexual assault of a child, under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 21.11, 22.011, without a plea agreement. The trial court accepted the plea and sentenced him. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant raised certain issues on appeal, but the court affirmed, with one modification to the judgment. The court agreed with case law's reasoning and held that allocution, for purposes of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.07, was not a constitutional right. Assuming that the right to allocute was constitutional, the error, if any, was harmless under Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(a), given that (1) appellant had the right to present evidence and argument to support mitigation, (2) he did not indicate that he wanted to tell the trial court he was pardoned, was incompetent, or had been misidentified after an escape, and (3) he did not indicate what additional evidence he would have raised if given the chance to address the trial court free from cross-examination. By failing to object, appellant waived any error regarding the constitutionality of his sentence under Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a). Even if he had preserved error, his 20-year sentence was within the range under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.33(a) and was not excessive or cruel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Because the judgment mistakenly referred to a nonexistent section of the Texas Penal Code, the court modified the judgment to show the correct statute for the offence of indecency. As modified, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State filed a third set of indictments against defendant, charging him with barratry and conspiracy to commit barratry, after the State voluntarily dismissed the first two sets of indictments. The State conceded that the first grand jury proceedings violated Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 20.04 (Supp. 2004). The court held that the trial court dismissed the first set of indictments without prejudice to the State. The State could have re-indicted defendant through the filing of two new indictments without violating the statute of limitations. Because the State failed to re-indict defendant without relying on the tainted grand jury testimony and instead allowed the limitations period to expire, the court found no reason to reverse the decision of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee city gave appellant dog owners notice that they were in violation of City of Bellmead, Tex., Mun. Code &sect; 3-40, which regulated the number of dogs and cats that could be kept on any one premise within the city. The 74th District Court, McLennan County, Texas, entered summary judgment in favor of the city in the owners' subsequent declaratory-judgment action, rejecting constitutional challenges to the ordinance. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After reviewing City of Bellmead, Tex., Mun. Code &sect; 3-40 and the record in the case, the court of appeals held that the ordinance arose out of the city's police power because it was designed to secure the safety, health, and welfare of the public. A municipality could rationally conclude that limiting the number of dogs in any given dwelling would protect the health and safety of its residents. The affidavits relied on by the owners demonstrated that reasonable minds could differ as to whether &sect; 3-40 had a substantial relationship to public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. Therefore, the ordinance did not violate substantive due process and could stand as a valid exercise of police power. The owners' equal protection claim also failed because they provided no support for the proposition that dog and cat ownership was a fundamental right or that as dog and cat owners, they were part of a suspect or quasi-suspect class subjected to invidious discrimination. The court also held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting discovery because discovery regarding the government interests at stake and prior enforcement was not relevant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant patient sued appellee anesthesiologist in the District Court of Travis County, 345th Judicial District, Texas, alleging that he negligently administered anesthesia during the patient's surgery. The anesthesiologist filed a motion to dismiss under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 74.351(b) after the patient failed to timely file an expert report, which was granted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The patient served his expert report after the 120-day statutory deadline, and the anesthesiologist filed a motion to dismiss under Tex.

Code Ann. &sect; 74.351 violated the open courts doctrine because it unreasonably interfered with a claimant's right of access to court. The appellate court noted that to prove that the statute violated the open courts provision, the claimant had to show that a cognizable common law cause of action was being restricted and that the restriction was unreasonable or arbitrary when balanced with the statute's purpose and basis. However, the appellate court held that it did not need to analyze the constitutionality of Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 74.351 because the patient had not satisfied his burden of showing that the expert-report requirements actually prevented him from pursuing his claims because he failed to explain his failure to comply with the statute; therefore, the statute was not unconstitutional as applied to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Court of Appeals for the Fourteenth District of Texas granted affirmed the trial court's judgment, which awarded two of respondent retired fire fighters for overtime pay and all of the retired fire fighters additional termination pay for accrued and unused sick and vacation leave. Petitioner city petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city argued that the two fire fighters were not entitled to be reimbursed for overtime pay because Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 142.0017(e)(2) did not require the city to count hours a fire fighter was on unpaid leave for purposes of computing eligibility for overtime compensation. The supreme court found that given the surrounding statutory scheme, the Legislature intended &quot;any other authorized leave&quot; in &sect; 142.0017(e)(2) to have the limited meaning of encompassing only other forms of paid leave. The supreme court had to presume that the Legislature's inclusion of only forms of paid leave and its omission of forms of unpaid leave in &sect; 142.0017(e)(2) were purposeful. The city was not required to count each debt day's final 8-hour shift when computer the hours the fire fighters were required to working during a 72-day work cycle for purposes of overtime compensation because they were on unpaid leave. The Legislature intended the term &quot;base salary&quot; or &quot;base pay&quot; in Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 143.110 to be one of six components of a fire fighter's salary and not merely a term to be used interchangeably with Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 143.115 and 143.116's reference to &quot;salary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment was affirmed as to the termination pay claim and reversed as to the debit dock claim, and rendered that two fire fighters take nothing as to their claims for previously docked overtime pay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court issued a custody order naming the parents as joint managing conservators and the grandmother as possessory conservator of the children. The mother filed a motion to modify the parent-child relationship, requesting that the grandmother's access to the children be terminated. After a hearing, the trial court granted the mother's motion. The court held that the trial court erred in applying the presumption that a parent acted in the best interest of her children in a modification proceeding. The court stated that this presumption, set forth in Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 153.433(2), applied only to an original custody proceeding but not to a modification proceeding. The trial court should have applied Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 156.101 (Supp. 2007), which placed the burden on the person seeking modification of an existing custody order to show that modification would be in the best interest of the child and that the circumstances of at least one of the parties affected by the order had materially and substantially changed since the order took effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the trial court's order and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The organization appealed the trial court's order granting the city's plea to the jurisdiction, contending that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to consider its constitutional challenge to a city ordinance, that it should have been allowed to present evidence at the hearing on the city's plea to the jurisdiction, and that it should have been afforded an opportunity to amend its pleadings rather than the case being dismissed. The appellate court affirmed however, stating that the ordinance was primarily penal in nature; the organization failed to show the vested property right necessary to establish jurisdiction in the trial court to enjoin the enforcement of the penal ordinance; and the organization failed to plead facts demonstrating how it would suffer irreparable injury from the ordinance prior to its enforcement against it. Further, the organization's pleadings affirmatively negated any jurisdiction in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed a judgment from the 241st Judicial District Court of Smith County (Texas), which convicted defendant under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.11 (Supp. 2008) of harassment by persons in certain correctional facilities. Defendant pleaded true to the State's enhancement allegations of two prior felony convictions, and the jury found those allegations to be true. The jury assessed defendant's punishment at 99 years of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The indictment alleged that defendant threw urine onto another person while confined in a county jail. Witnesses testified that they knew the substance was urine based on its smell. The caption of the indictment incorrectly identified the offense charged, but the body of the indictment correctly stated the charge. The court rejected defendant's constitutional challenges to &sect; 22.11, holding that neither the United States nor the Texas constitutions prohibited criminalizing specific acts engaged in by incarcerated or confined persons. Moreover, &sect; 22.11 was not vague in identifying the mental state required; and even if any ambiguity existed, it would be cured by Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 6.02 (Supp. 2008). The erroneous caption did not render the indictment defective, and the indictment did not have to be amended to enhance the sentence under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 12.42(d) (Supp. 2008), 22.11(b). The testimony provided sufficient evidence to uphold the conviction. Defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, alleging failure to object, lacked merit because defendant did not identify any objections counsel could have made and the enhancement notice was timely.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant inmate, and other inmates, filed a lengthy pro se, in forma pauperis lawsuit against numerous appellee individuals alleging various claims, including violations of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The 278th District Court, Walker County (Texas), dismissed the suits. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the inmate claimed that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing the attorney general to act as amicus curiae, and by dismissing his claims for failure to comply with Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 14.005. The appellate court determined that the trial court could entertain suggestions from amicus curiae, which was not a party. The inmate admitted that his damage claims were generally subject to the inmate grievance system. Nevertheless, the inmate claimed that one of his issues was not subject to the inmate grievance system because it related to publications. The inmate argued that the claim was subject, instead, to correspondence review procedures. The appellate court found, however, that the inmate did not allege or prove facts that would show that the claim was not subject to the grievance system. The inmate argued that he substantially complied with &sect; 14.005, but he did not explain how he did so. The inmate also failed to show that the statute was unconstitutional. Finally, the inmate failed to point to any evidence in the record showing how the prison grievance procedures prevented the inmate from exhausting administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted in the 36th District Court of Aransas County (Texas) of driving while intoxicated. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued, inter alia, that counsel was ineffective for failing to file discovery motions or a motion to suppress. The court of appeals disagreed. The record established that defendant's trial counsel effectively cross-examined the deputy and the trooper regarding the events surrounding defendant's arrest. The record contained a photocopy of a videotape recording of defendant's arrest. Defendant did not develop a record showing what evidence could have been discovered through any motions for discovery. Additionally, defendant's traffic infraction was more than sufficient to give rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminally related activity and thereby, justified the initial traffic stop. The deputy, having the right of way, entered the intersection at the same time defendant's pickup truck accelerated and entered the intersection, and the deputy had to slam on the brakes and swerve to avoid a collision. Accordingly, trial counsel's decision not to file a motion to suppress was not so deficient and lacking in tactical or strategic decision-making as to overcome the presumption that trial counsel's conduct was reasonable and professional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The juvenile argued that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering his probation transferred. The State responded that the trial court's order was not appealable. The court agreed with the State that Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 56.01(c) (2003) did not provide for a right of appeal from an order entered under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 54.051 to transfer a determinate sentence probation to an appropriate district court. The court found no merit in the juvenile's argument that denying him a right of appeal deprived him of his due process and equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. The court stated that the right to appeal was not of constitutional magnitude and was regulated by the legislature. Thus, when a legislative enactment said that a juvenile could appeal certain orders delineated therein, no right of appeal existed as to orders not specified. The court also noted that the juvenile's constitutional argument failed because he was treated the same as all similarly situated juveniles whose determinate sentence probation was transferred to a criminal district court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In its indictment, the State alleged that defendant was the owner of a dog he knew to be dangerous, and that defendant's dangerous dog, while not restrained in a secure enclosure, made an unprovoked attack on the complainant, causing serious bodily injury. The trial court dismissed the indictment with prejudice on the ground that Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 822.005(a)(2) was unconstitutional, facially and as applied. The appellate court ruled that Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 822.005(a)(2) was neither facially unconstitutional, nor was it unconstitutional as applied to defendant because it was subject to a culpable mental state of at least recklessly. Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 822.005(a)(2) complied with the requirements of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 6.01(a) and (c), and was therefore not unconstitutional.

The County Court at Law of Nacogdoches County, Texas, entered a final judgment against the insurer and the insured, holding them jointly and severally liable. The insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A tractor-trailer operator lost control and traveled off the road into a deep ditch. The operator was injured, removed from the tractor, interviewed by a trooper, and taken to a hospital. The insured owned the tractor and the trailer. Both the tractor and the trailer were insured against physical damage under a policy issued by the insurer. The trooper had a wrecker service tow the tractor and trailer. The insurer refused to pay the wrecker service's bill. The trial court found the insurer liable for the towing services. Under Tex. Occ. Code Ann. &sect; 2303.003(a) (2004), the appellate court determined that sufficient evidence supported the trial court's implied finding of fact that the tow was not performed with consent because the trooper gave conflicting testimony about whether he recalled the operator's expressing a consent to tow, and a reasonable finder of fact could have resolved this conflicting evidence in favor of a nonfinding of consent. Also, the evidence of repair costs that exceeded the value of the property to be repaired constituted legally sufficient evidence of a total loss. In addition, Tex. Occ. Code Ann. &sect; 2303.156(b) was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
