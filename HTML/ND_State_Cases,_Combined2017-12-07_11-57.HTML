HOLDINGS: [1]-The district court erred in suppressing evidence seized after a traffic stop on the ground that &sect; 39-21-25(2) was unconstitutionally vague because the officer's belief that the law prohibited operating a vehicle with more than four illuminated front facing lights was objectively reasonable under the circumstances; [2]-The validity of the stop did not turn on the constitutionality of the statute but on deciding whether reasonable suspicion existed at the time of the traffic stop to believe defendant was in violation of &sect; 39-21-25(2), and the evidence supported a reasonable suspicion he was in violation of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a driving under the influence case, respondent, the Judge of the District Court, Southwest Judicial District (North Dakota), ruled that petitioner State was required to produce at trial the nurse that drew the blood of respondent driver in order to introduce evidence of her blood alcohol level. The State petitioned for a supervisory writ directing the trial court to withdraw its pretrial order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the State notified the driver it intended to introduce at trial the analytical report regarding her blood alcohol level, she sent the State a subpoena to serve on the nurse who drew her blood. The State moved to quash the subpoena. The high court ruled that a signed statement from an individual qualified to draw a blood sample for testing contemplated under N.D.C.C. &sect; 39-20-07(10) was a testimonial statement. Thus, the person who signed such a statement was a witness for confrontation purposes and a defendant was entitled to be confronted with that individual at trial unless he or she was unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. N.D. R. Evid. 707, when construed with &sect; 39-20-07 and the constitutional rights it provided, required the State to produce the individual who drew the defendant's blood sample if the defendant objected under 707(b) and identified the individual who drew the defendant's blood as a witness to be produced at trial. To the extent the high court's prior cases, such as State v. Gietzen, 786 N.W.2d 1, and State v. Friedt, 735 N.W.2d 848, were inconsistent with this holding, they were overruled.</SPAN></P>

Funding for the program came from city sales tax revenues. The court noted that the district court's memorandum decision was appealable under N.D.C.C. &sect; 28-27-02 because it disposed of all of the parties' claims and thus was the final order. The court held that because statutorily authorized economic development programs constituted an enterprise, N.D. Const. art. X, &sect; 18 allowed governmental entities to make loans, extend credit, or make donations while implementing those programs; however, the prohibition against gifts of public funds did not otherwise allow the entities to engage in loaning, giving credit, or making donations to or in aid of any individual, association, or corporation. Moreover, because economic development programs promoted the prosperity and general welfare of the people within a governmental entity, which was a public purpose, authorized economic development programs satisfied the public purpose component of N.D. Const. art. X, &sect; 18 and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen claimed that North Dakota's Urban Renewal Law, N.D.C.C. ch. 40-58, violated the gift clause provisions of N.D.

On appeal, the court found that the Act was constitutional, but the record did not establish whether the city's renewal plan complied with the provisions of the Act. Remand was necessary to resolve whether there was an appropriate resolution, pursuant to N.D.C.C. &sect; 40-58-06, to add additional city blocks to the renewal area. If there was not an appropriate resolution, then the city was precluded from diverting tax increment funds for those additional blocks for a period of time between modification plans.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly struck his girlfriend, who then called 911. She then met responding police officers outside defendant's home. According to one officers, she was frantic and frightened, and her main concern was for her three children, ages nine, five, and two, who were locked in the home with defendant. The officer knocked on the door, and when defendant answered, he yelled an expletive and tried to shut the door. The officer determined that defendant was very intoxicated. The officer then kept defendant from trying to shut the door by putting his arm up. He entered the residence and heard some children making noise. Defendant raised his fist as if to hit the officer, and a physical altercation ensued. Defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence. The trial court denied the motion and he conditionally pled guilty to a charge of simple assault on a peace officer. The state supreme court found that defendant's rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment and N.D. Const. art.

The state supreme court then reviewed it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature enacted a law, N.D.C.C. &sect; 15-10-46, that required the state university to use the &quot;Fighting Sioux&quot; nickname and logo for its intercollegiate athletic teams. Later, the legislature enacted a senate bill that repealed N.D.C.C. &sect; 15-10-46 and provided that an athletic nickname or corresponding logo could not be adopted before a certain date. Then, the Secretary of State approved a referendum petition for circulation to the North Dakota voters to reject that bill. Doing so suspended the enactment and effectively reinstated the law requiring the use of that nickname and logo. The Attorney General, on behalf of the state board of higher education, petitioned the state supreme court to exercise its original jurisdiction and enjoin the Secretary of State from placing the referendum petition on the upcoming primary election ballot. The state supreme court found that the referendum petition suspending the senate bill presented a justiciable issue for it. However, it also found that since not enough state supreme court members voted to decide the constitutional issue of the state board of higher education's authority over the state university, it would not decide that issue.</SPAN></P>

The motorist appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city police officer cited the motorist with careless driving, a noncriminal offense proscribed by Grand Forks, N.D., City Code &sect; 8-0701. Under Grand Forks, N.D., City Code &sect; 8-1502, the maximum fine for violation of a noncriminal offense was $1,000 &quot;in the discretion of the court.&quot; He pled not guilty. After a municipal court trial, he was found guilty. The municipal court then imposed a $ 151 fine and a $ 15 hearing fee. The trial court affirmed. The state supreme court dismissed the appeal because that judgment was not appealable. A few years later, the state supreme court in a separate case held that a home rule city could not impose fees for noncriminal traffic offenses exceeding the limits set forth for equivalent state law violations. Thereafter, he filed an action against the city and claimed that the amount of monies paid to it for fines exceeded the state law limits for fines for similar state offenses. The trial court dismissed his action based on the res judicata doctrine. The state supreme court found that his contention could have been raised in his earlier case and, thus, was barred by res judicata from being raised and decided in the later case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Divide County District Court, Northwest Judicial District, North Dakota, which convicted her of driving while her license was suspended, possession of a controlled substance while driving a motor vehicle, and four additional drug possession charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a condition of bail, the district court required defendant to consent to a warrantless search at any time of her person, vehicle, and residence. The court concluded the district court committed reversible error in failing to make a specific finding of appropriateness under N.D. R. Crim. P. 46(a)(2)(M) when it imposed conditions of pretrial release that required defendant to consent to a warrantless search at any time of her person, vehicle, and residence. The district court attempted to explain to defendant its rationale for imposing random drug-testing as a condition of pretrial release, but it did not address its reasoning for imposing the requirement that she submit to warrantless searches of her person, vehicle, and residence. Under the circumstances, defendant did not provide voluntary consent to search her former residence. Although the State argued the district court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress because officers relied in good faith on the district court's amended bond order, the imposition of a warrantless search provision in a bond order was too remote a circumstance to be compared to a probable cause determination resulting in a search warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of two convictions resulting from the traffic stop of defendant, but it reversed the judgment of four convictions resulting from the bail-condition search.</SPAN></P>

In the underlying case, defendant had been convicted of murdering another man and that conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. Defendant appealed the denial of his second post-conviction relief application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murdering a man. He appealed, but the state supreme court affirmed his conviction. In the meantime, a second person charged with murdering the man was tried before a jury and acquitted. Several years after his conviction was affirmed, defendant filed an application for post-conviction relief. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied his application. He appealed, but that state supreme court affirmed. He then filed a second application for post-conviction relief. He argued that he was entitled to relief because of newly discovered evidence, ineffective assistance of trial counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, and ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel. The State urged dismissal as to all claims except the post-conviction ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The trial court then summarily dismissed all of his claims. On appeal, the state supreme court found that he might be entitled to relief on his postconviction ineffective assistance of counsel claim and, thus, summary dismissal of that claim under N.D.C.C. &sect; 29-32.1-06(2) was error, although it found that the other claims had been properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court affirmed the trial court's summary dismissal of defendant's evidentiary, ineffective assistance of trial counsel, and prosecutorial misconduct claims, but reversed the trial court's summary dismissal of his claim of ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel. Also, it remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Workers' Compensation claimant appealed from a judgment of the District Court of Mercer County, South Central Judicial District (North Dakota) that affirmed a Workforce Safety &amp; Insurance (WSI) order that awarded him additional permanent impairment benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant argued that WSI erred in its promulgation of administrative rules for assessing pain impairment. The supreme court disagreed. WSI's promulgation of regulations setting forth specific percentages for purposes of consistency of application of the AMA Guides in North Dakota contemplated an area not sufficiently covered by the fifth edition of the AMA Guides. The claimant's challenge related mainly to the sufficiency of the impairment percentages assigned by WSI to the AMA Guides table 18-3 in its administrative rules. In promulgating the rules, WSI's staff attorney researched other jurisdictions and consulted experts, including experts within WSI. WSI's promulgation of the rules was not without a rational basis. Under N.D.C.C. &sect; 65-05-12.2(6) the legislature authorized WSI to adopt administrative rules to incorporate principles not sufficiently covered by the AMA Guides. Therefore, N.D. Admin. Code &sect; 92-01-02-25(4) did not conflict with N.D.C.C. &sect; 65-05-12.2(6) and WSI did not act arbitrarily, capriciously, or unreasonably in adopting N.D. Admin.

The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father challenged the Department's findings leading to the determination that the child was an &quot;abused child,&quot; N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 50-25.1-0. The supreme court found that a parent's use of reasonable force to prevent or punish misconduct or maintain discipline may not provide the basis for a finding that a child was an abused child. Under the circumstances, the Department's findings that the child suffered an impairment of physical condition, including physical pain, and that the father had inflicted bodily injury upon the child were supported by a preponderance of the evidence. The child was struck 24 times with a wooden backscratcher with sufficient force to create large purple bruises that were still visible days later. A reasoning mind could determine the Department's finding that the force the father used was not reasonable force was proven by the weight of the evidence. His use of force was not justified under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 12.1-05-05(1) and did not preclude a finding that the child was abused under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 50-25.1-02(3).

An administrative law judge affirmed, and the employee appealed. The District Court of Mercer County, South Central Judicial District (North Dakota) also affirmed, concluding that &sect; 65-05-09.3 did not violate equal protection because it was rationally related to a legitimate government interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee's appeal of her benefit reduction broadly outlined &quot;two schools of thought,&quot; regarding whether terminating or reducing a disabled worker's wage loss benefits upon reaching social security retirement age was discriminatory. Her discussion of the cases she cited to support her argument was limited and she did not explain how the cases were similar or distinct from the particular facts of the case. The employee's arguments on appeal challenging &sect; 65-05-09.3 were conclusory and notable in their lack of analysis, particularly regarding the legislative history of the statute. Additionally, in response to extensive briefing by WSI, the employee did not submit a reply brief. Although a reply brief was not required by N.D. R. App. P. 28(d), the employee's failure to file a reply brief only served to highlight the inadequacy of the initial briefing.

Although the State submitted a document entitled, &quot;State's Response to Defendant's Motion for Post-Conviction Relief,&quot; the State did not expressly ask the court to summarily dismiss petitioner's application. A mere response by the State was insufficient to put a petitioner to his or her proof; the State merely claimed petitioner had not proved his allegations, which he was not required to do in his application. The district court relied on matters outside the pleadings, therefore, the court's motion for summary dismissal must be treated as a motion for summary judgment. Under N. D. R. Civ. P. 56(c), a party opposing a summary judgment motion must be given thirty days to file an answer brief and supporting papers. Petitioner was entitled to notice and thirty days to file an answer brief and supporting papers to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.</SPAN></P>

This factual scenario did not meet any of the grounds for reversal listed in N.D.C.C. &sect; 28-32-46.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was taken into detention and accused of gross sexual imposition and ingestion of a controlled substance. His father argued he was denied the ability to exercise his constitutional right to parent, because he lacked legal representation during his son's delinquency proceedings. The Supreme Court of North Dakota rejected his claim. Amendments to N.D.C.C. &sect; 27-20-26(1) removed a parent's right to appointed counsel during the delinquency adjudication. The amendments to N.D.C.C. &sect; 27-20-26(1) restricting the right to counsel did not infringe on fundamental parenting rights. If anything, the father's guidance as a parent was going to be even more important following the incident. The juvenile court was not required to inform the juvenile of the registration requirement during the adjudication stage of the delinquency proceeding, because it was a collateral consequence of his admissions. The amendments to N.D.C.C. &sect; 27-20-26(1) were rationally related to the legitimate purpose of protecting the rights of juveniles while minimizing parental conflict with the court's proceedings; there was no equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, the North Dakota State Board of Equalization (State Board) and the Grand Forks Board of County Commissioners (County Board), denied applications from appellant property owners for exemptions from real estate taxes. The District Court of Grand Forks County, Northeast Central Judicial District (North Dakota), dismissed the owners' appeals from those decisions. The property owners sought review of the dismissal of the appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners argued that the district court erred in concluding that the State Board had no legal authority to determine whether their properties were entitled to charitable tax exemptions under state law. On appeal, the court disagreed. It examined guidance on assessment of property found in N.D. Const. art. X, &sect; 4, and N.D.C.C. ch. 57, and saw nothing providing the State Board with the authority to reclassify as tax exempt locally assessed properties. The conclusion that the State Board had no authority to grant the property owners the relief they sought necessarily disposed of their arguments that the district court erred in dismissing the State Board from the action under N.D. R. Civ. P. 21 and that the district court erred in denying their motion to amend the pleadings and issue a writ of mandamus. Finally, the court determined that the thirty-day period for appealing from the County Board's decision was not tolled. The property owners elected their remedy by appealing the County Board's decision to the State Board. A decision by the State Board was not necessary to &quot;finalize&quot; the County Board's decision. The County Board's decision was final when it was issued.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because: (1) the child victim testified that defendant forced her to place her hands on his penis over his clothing and forced her to move her hand over his penis; (2) defendant was in a relationship with the victim's mother and periodically lived with them between May 2008 and January 2009; and (3) the victim testified the sexual contacts occurred almost daily when defendant lived with them, including the day he was arrested for the offense. Defendant failed to establish that his Sixth Amendment right to a fair and impartial jury was violated because he failed to show that there was a disproportionate representation of Hispanics on the jury panel as no evidence was presented on the number of Hispanic individuals in the jury panel or the percentage of Hispanics on other jury panels in the county.

In denying the request for mandamus relief, the supreme court found that the correct interpretation of N.D. Const. art. III, &sect; 10 was that any elected official of the state was subject to recall. A United States Senator was not a state official, but was a federal official elected by the state constituency. Moreover, the removal of all references to &quot;congressional officers&quot; in North Dakota's recall provision diminished the scope of the people's recall power. Therefore, N.D. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 1, 10 did not permit the recall of North Dakota's congressional delegation. Next, N.D. Const. art. III, &sect; 2 dealt solely with initiative and referendum processes, and N.D. Const. art. III, &sect; 10 did not restrict the Secretary's authority in reviewing the corporation's petition to its form.

The mother argued the district court erred in denying her motion to dismiss because the grandfather did not have standing to bring a paternity action under N.D.C.C. &sect; 14-20-37.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandfather instituted the action just prior to being appointed personal representative of his deceased son's estate. The grandfather subsequently amended the complaint to clarify that he was bringing the action individually and as a personal representative. Under N.D. R. Civ. P. 17(a) the real party could be joined or substituted as a party before the action was dismissed for failing to prosecute the action in the name of the real party in interest. The grandfather's status as a personal representative related back in time and gave him standing to bring a paternity action when the action began. Contrary to the mother's assertions, N.D.C.C. &sect; 14-09-05.1 did not require the grandfather to have an existing relationship with the child before a court could order visitation. The evidence supported the court's findings that the grandfather would respect the mother's wishes and would support the parent-child relationship. The mother's claim that the order violated her constitutional right to be free from government intervention was not raised in the trial court and was not considered on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent appealed an order of the District Court of Burleigh County, South Central Judicial District, North Dakota, that committed him as a sexually dangerous individual, arguing that North Dakota's civil commitment statute was void for vagueness and that the self-incrimination and guarantee precluded the use of his treatment-related disclosures in a civil commitment proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the civil commitment law, N.D.C.C. ch. 25-03.3, was not void for vagueness because it created minimum guidelines, giving a clear definition of a sexually dangerous individual and definitions of the terms used. Specifically, N.D.C.C. &sect; 25-03.3-01 defined &quot;sexual act,&quot; &quot;sexual contact,&quot; &quot;sexually predatory conduct,&quot; and other terms. The law provided a reasonable person with adequate and fair warning of the proscribed conduct, and under the reasonable person standard, a person of common intelligence would not need to guess at the law's meaning. In addition, the district court did not err in considering treatment-related disclosures made by respondent because all sexually predatory conduct could be considered in an analysis under N.D.C.C. &sect; 25-03.3-01(8), including conduct not resulting in a charge or conviction. Further, because the civil commitment proceedings were civil and not criminal in nature, the constitutional guarantee against self-incrimination was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant registered as a sex offender in North Dakota in 2008, and he gave his address as a gas station parking lot. After being told to relocate on August 14, defendant attempted to stay at a city park. He stayed at various locations for several days. On August 20, he notified law enforcement that he planned to move to another town. On August 22, he registered as a sex offender there. Defendant was convicted of failing to comply with the registration requirements, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the supreme court determined that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 12.1-32-15 was not unconstitutional under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and N.D. Const. art. I, &sect; 18. It has already been decided that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 12.1-32-15 was not an ex post facto law. Therefore, the retroactive application of &sect; 12.1-32-15 to defendant was not unconstitutional. Next, because defendant failed to register within 3 days of a change of address, he did not comply with the registration requirements. The trial court did not err in its interpretation of the statute, and it properly instructed the jury. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, petitioner argued that she was entitled to an evidentiary hearing and that the district court erred by summarily dismissing her application. Although the district court cancelled the hearing on petitioner's application after the State requested summary disposition, petitioner did not dispute she was put on notice the State was putting her to her proof. She was required to supplement her application at that point with competent admissible evidence by affidavit or other means. Because she did not supplement her application to show there was a genuine issue of material fact, summary disposition was appropriate. The court also determined that petitioner did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel when her attorney did not pursue perjury charges against her probation officer. The probation officer's testimony did not contribute to petitioner's probation being revoked, because the allegations to which he was testifying were dismissed by the State and the probation was actually revoked based on petitioner's admission to four other allegations. The district court properly determined that the State was entitled to judgment as a matter of law with regard to that claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a premises liability case, plaintiffs husband and wife sued defendants shopping mall owner and church organization for personal injuries suffered by the wife. The District Court of Burleigh County, South Central Judicial District (North Dakota) granted summary judgment to both defendants on the grounds that they were entitled to recreational immunity. Husband and wife appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Husband and wife argued, inter alia, that the district court did not view the evidence in the light most favorable to them and erred in finding, as a matter of law, that wife's use of the land was recreational in character. The supreme court agreed, and framed the issue as involving the scope of &quot;recreational purposes&quot; in a case in which the property &quot;owners&quot; were a mall and a church and their purposes had recreational and nonrecreational components. The court found that the district court erred when it considered only the wife's purposes in entering the premises. Instead, the court held that where the premises &quot;owners&quot; purposes were mixed, the court should have balanced plaintiff's purposes with the mixed recreational and commercial purposes of the owners to determine application of recreational use immunity. There was evidence that the mall and the church had mixed purposes. These included the mall owner's hope to increase business by allowing the church to use the property for an automotive exhibition and the church's hope to increase its membership and tithes. In addition, there was evidence that the church procured sponsors and charged contestants a registration fee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff widow sought review of an order of the District Court of Morton County, South Central Judicial District (North Dakota), which granted summary judgment dismissing her survival action filed on behalf of the estate of her husband, seeking to recover damages for alleged asbestos-related injuries from defendants, numerous asbestos manufacturers, distributors, and sellers. The district court found that the action was time-barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1995 and died of the disease in 1996. The widow alleged that the decedent's doctors never informed him or any family member that his lung cancer was related to his asbestos exposure. She alleged that she first learned of a connection in 2000 based on a coworker's suggestion and in 2003 based on a doctor's written report. The widow brought the survival action in 2005. Defendants relied on two notations made prior to 1996 in the decedent's medical records mentioning his asbestos exposure. On appeal, the parties agreed that the six-year statute of limitations in N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 28-01-16(5) applied, but they disputed when the survival cause of action accrued. In a series of opinions from the justices, there were three votes from the court to reverse and remand the matter for trial on the issue of when there was notice that the asbestos exposure was the possible cause of the decedent's terminal illness. There were not enough votes, however, to determine whether or not the discovery rule applied to extend the accrual of a survival action brought under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 28-01-26.1 beyond the date of the decedent's death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the matter for trial on the merits of the widow's claims and on all defenses, including when there was notice that exposure to asbestos was the possible cause of the decedent's terminal illness, the statute of limitations, and the application of the discovery rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner argued, inter alia, that counsel rendered ineffective assistance. The supreme court disagreed. The district court found that counsel employed an &quot;appropriate&quot; trial strategy in light of petitioner's statement to investigators in which he admitted gagging and binding the victim and striking him with a rock. Counsel testified that he did not consider an alleged co-participant's acquittal, which occurred while petitioner's original appeal was pending, to provide petitioner with any new grounds for relief. The only evidence petitioner produced regarding the likely substance of the co-participant's testimony was an inmate's statement to police. In that statement, the inmate told police that the co-participant &quot;admitted that he took part in the murder&quot; and stated &quot;no one could prove how many times he hit the victim with the rock.&quot; Thus, even if the co-participant testified in the manner suggested by the inmate's statement, the jury would have likely still found petitioner guilty of murder because he admitted to gagging the victim, leaving him bound in the hogtie position, and striking him in the head with the rock.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The referee found that in March 2009, appellant began serving a 48-month sentence for her involvement in a drug conspiracy charge, of which she had to serve at least 85 percent. The referee also found that appellant had been unsuccessful in addressing her chemical addiction, she admitted to ongoing chemical use and her prognosis for sobriety was guarded at best. In addition, the referee determined that the services and treatment provided to appellant had not abated the causes of deprivation and that the children continued to be deprived, which was likely to continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, appellant's argument effectively conceded that further harm was actually avoided by placing the children outside of the parental home with their maternal grandmother and that termination of her parental rights was appropriate. Moreover, pursuant to N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 27-20-44(1)(c)(2), the termination was sustained by the referee's finding that the children had spent more than 450 out of the previous 660 nights out of the parental home. Finally, application of expedited appeal procedures under N.D. R. App. P. 2.2 did not infringe on appellant's right to procedural due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The neighbors argued that the district court erred in deciding that they lacked standing to appeal the Morton County Commission's (Commission) decision. The supreme court found that the Commission's decision to grant a conditional use permit for a feedlot within the one mile odor setback of the proposed house had the effect of diminishing and injuriously affecting the neighbor's personal and individual interest in his land and in a manner different than that suffered by the public generally. The neighbor had been factually aggrieved by the decision and had standing to appeal. The record reflected that there had been no inspections of the neighbors' proposed house before the Commission issued the conditional use permit to the landowner. The neighbors did not demonstrate that they had made substantial expenditures in reliance upon their building permit. The Commission did not err in finding that there was no existing residence within one mile of the proposed feedlot. The Commission considered appropriate factors and its decision was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. The neighbors could not turn the appeal from the Commission's decision into an inverse condemnation action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court should have dismissed the charge for violating a domestic violence protection order because the order violated his constitutional right to intrastate travel and held that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 14-07.1-02 was intended to protect victims of domestic violence from further harm. By engaging in behavior that led to a domestic violence protection order, defendant forfeited his right to travel to the place of the victim's employment. In doing so, defendant engaged in conduct that was not constitutionally protected and that violated the order of protection. Further, the evidence obtained from defendant's seizure was admissible. Law enforcement was advised by campus security that defendant was on campus in violation of a protection order, and defendant was driving on the campus when he was stopped by campus security and held for arrest by law enforcement. Because there was a valid protection order prohibiting defendant front going onto the campus, the protection order and defendant's presence on the campus provided the law enforcement officers with reasonable and articulable suspicion to conduct an investigative stop.</SPAN></P>

The district court denied the request because the applicant failed to establish he had a clear legal right to the information. On appeal, the court found no abuse of discretion. Under N.D. Admis. Prac. R. 13 governing the confidentiality of bar admission records, the records the applicant requested were confidential because they did not fall under any exception. In adopting N.D. Admis. Prac.

Using the plain, ordinary, and commonly understand meaning of &quot;immediately&quot; in the Governor's proclamation, under the circumstances of the case a reasonable person would know defendant's conduct violated the tagging requirement. There was evidence that defendant killed a white-tailed doe, transported the deer back to his home, and began sawing the legs off the deer before tagging it. The evidence did not support an innocence or mistake instruction ad defendant had a means of complying with the tagging requirement but chose not to. The evidence did not support an excuse instruction. Defendant's U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department received a complaint from the tenant, who was disabled and used a wheelchair. The tenant alleged that the landlord had committed discriminatory acts by failing to comply with the design and construction requirements under federal and state law for its apartments. The building in which the tenant resided received its certificate of occupancy in 1998. The Department issued a determination of reasonable cause and a charge of discrimination against the landlord.  The landlord moved for summary dismissal of the action, claiming it was barred by the two-year statute of limitations under the federal and state acts. The trial court dismissed the action. On appeal, the court concluded that the two-year statutes of limitation in N.D. Cent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of stalking and two counts of disobeying a judicial order. On appeal, the court found that defendant was not engaged in constitutionally protected activities under &sect; 12.1-17-07.1(5). Defendant had previously pled guilty to stalking the victim, and, as part of his probation, he was prohibited from going within 500 feet of her or her children's schools. He had previously violated those conditions and had served time in jail as a result. He thus had notice to stay away from the victim and not to contact her. The activities defendant engaged in were not constitutionally protected because his right to travel had been restricted by the judicial order. Once he engaged in an intentional course of conduct directed at the victim that would cause a reasonable person to experience fear, intimidation, or harassment, his conduct was no longer constitutionally protected because he did not have a constitutional right to engage in activities that harmed another person. A reasonable person would have understood that his conduct was prohibited by &sect; 12.1-17-07.1. He thus did not have standing to claim that the statute was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The city presented sufficient evidence to establish a nuisance. The city presented the testimony of a city building inspector who became aware of the owner's property from neighborhood complaints. The building inspector inspected a fence on the property and described it as being constructed of &quot;used materials&quot; and being &quot;somewhat dilapidated.&quot; The inspector estimated there were 80 to 100 tires, more than 100 hubcaps, and between 13 to 20 vehicles on the property. He testified the vehicles were not licensed and had been inoperative for more than 60 days according to his observations over time.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant worked for a trucking company and allegedly purchased a vehicle glider kit upon a counterfeit invoice and other deceptive writings and forgery. Defendant argued that the charges were multiplicious and that his multiple convictions violated double jeopardy. The court concluded that defendant was improperly convicted and sentenced upon multiplicious counts. Multiple convictions and punishments were not permitted for the same conduct under the theft by deception, forgery or counterfeiting, and deceptive writings statutes, under N.D.C.C. &sect;&sect; 12.1-24-01(1), 12.1-24-03(1), 12.1-23-02(2). The only remedy was for the district court to exercise its discretion and vacate the multiple convictions and concurrent sentences. Defendant also contended that the State engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by commenting on defendant's post-arrest and post-Miranda silence. The court held that defendant failed to demonstrate a constitutional violation because there was no evidence that defendant's silence was after he was taken into custody and given Miranda warnings. Impeachment by use of prearrest silence did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The landowners alleged an unlawful taking without just compensation under N.D. Const. art. I, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners claimed that 15 government drainage projects designed to alleviate farm flooding in the Devils Lake drainage basin proximately caused flooding of their property above the ordinary high watermark of Devils Lake. The district court decided that the drainage projects were not the proximate cause of the landowners' damages and that an act of God, an unprecedented wet cycle, was the sole proximate cause of their damages. On appeal, the court declined to decide whether the district court erred in employing a substantial part analysis for proximate cause for some of the drainage projects because it concluded that the landowners invited the district court to use that formulation in their posttrial briefs. Thus, the landowners conceded the issue. Because the landowners' evidence that the drainage projects caused additional water to enter the lake was speculative, they failed to establish that the projects proximately caused their damages. The district court's finding that an act of God caused the water to rise was not clearly erroneous. The court declined to address the landowners' statute of limitations arguments.</SPAN></P>

The plain language of N.D. Cent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court concluded that the county substantially complied with post-enactment statutory publication requirements, which required the county to immediately publish notice of the ordinance in the official county newspaper. The ordinance was not invalid for failure to strictly comply with the statutory publication requirement. However, the district court erred in declaring the ordinance valid under the repealed version of N.D. Cent. Code ch. 11-33. N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 23-25-11(9) explicitly limited the county's authority to regulate animal feeding operations and provided that the county could do no more than regulate the location of the operation, size of operation and type of animal. The legislature gave the authority to adopt environmental regulations for animal feeding operations to the North Dakota Department of Health. The ordinance regulated more than the location of a feeding operation, the type of animals and size of the operation. 2007 amendments to ch. 11-33 clarified the county's authority to regulate concentrated feeding operations.

Prof'l Conduct 4.1, which prohibited the making of false statements, where the standardized form letters utilized contained false, untrue, and misleading statements. The attorney purchased form letters from another firm and knew that the allegations contained in them--such as challenges to the existence of a particular account--could not possibly be true for each of his more than 9,000 clients. Further, the attorney violated N.D. R.

The court found that the State complied with the statutory requirements under N.D. Cent.

Even though the State did not admit the report during the hearing, it was part of the record and readily available for the district court's review because it was filed with the district court. The psychologist's detailed testimony provided the State with the evidence required to meet its burden of proof. The patient's prior gross sexual imposition conviction, along with testimony that the patient suffered from two sexual disorders, had not completed sex offender treatment, and still engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior while in treatment supported the conclusion that the patient continued to be a sexually dangerous individual. Finally, the patient's due process rights were not violated because his having been committed for nine years did not show that he would remain committed indefinitely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The narcotics task force received a tip claiming that a probationer would be selling methamphetamine to defendant. Officers watched the probationer's workplace and saw defendant get into his vehicle with him. The officers removed defendant from the vehicle, placed him in handcuffs, and conducted a pat-down search for weapons. The district court held the initial pat-down search of defendant was constitutionally permissible because it was based on officer safety. After law enforcement completed the first frisk of defendant, the search of the probationer, and his car, none of which produced any evidence of weapons, the continued seizure of defendant violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable seizure. This warranted the application of the exclusionary rule for any evidence the officers obtained following the unlawful seizure. Although defendant was given his Miranda warnings before he made an admission, this did not clear the taint of the Fourth Amendment violation. Because the State addressed the requirements of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 29-28-07(5), it was permitted to appeal the grant of defendant's suppression motion.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found that the trade association clause did not specially refer to the two associations. It did not contemplate a closed class and did not preclude other organizations from accession into the class if they met those qualifications. There was no language in the trade association clause or N.D. Cent. Code ch. 54-44.4 that exempted the competitive bidding requirements from the procurement of contractual services by the Commission. The legislature could classify trade associations incorporated in the state and having as their primary purpose the representation of wheat producers from other groups for purposes of contracting for activities related to domestic wheat policy issues, wheat production, promotion and sales.

Land within the boundaries of the flood protection system belonged to the property owner, who farmed the property. On appeal, the property owner contended a property within the improvement district could only be assessed on the basis of the cost of the portion of the project from which it actually received a benefit. The supreme court concluded, however, that a special assessment commission did not act arbitrarily, capriciously, or unreasonably because multiple related projects could be included in a single improvement, and the total cost of the improvement could be divided and assessed to all properties that received a special benefit from the improvement, so long as the assessment was not more than the special benefit received. Further, the special assessments conformed to N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 40-23-07. While the property owner could plan to continue farming the land for the foreseeable future and the property could not currently utilize the full benefit of the flood protection, the evidence supported the findings that the property received a special benefit from the flood protection project and that the benefits exceeded the assessment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that under the current rule in North Dakota and federal courts, defendant lost his expectation of privacy when he placed the trash for collection on the sidewalk in front of his house, and therefore the garbage search fell outside the protections of the Fourth Amendment and N.D.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that N.D. Cent.

Code ch. 25-03.3 violated equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, and N.D. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 21 and 22, because the statute did not provide the same procedures as N.D.

Code &sect; 25-03.3-17 did not violate the separation of powers doctrine. While permitting the executive director to petition for an inmate's release, the statute required the district court to make the ultimate decision about an inmate's discharge. N.D. Cent. Code ch. 25-03.3 did not violate equal protection, regardless of the level of scrutiny applied, because the state had a compelling interest in protecting the public, and appellant failed to show that the legislature was not justified in treating mentally ill and sexually dangerous individuals differently.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the landowners contended the district court erred in determining they were violating the ordinance. The supreme court held that the district court did not err in imposing a restriction on the landowners for parking heavy construction equipment on the premises pursuant to former Minot, N.D. Zoning Ordinance No. 2223, and that the zoning ordinance gave adequate warning of the proscribed conduct. The district court's finding that the landowners did not have a permissible &quot;home occupation&quot; under the zoning ordinance was not clearly erroneous. The City could validly consider aesthetics under its authority to zone for the purpose of promoting the general welfare of the community under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 40-47-01. The district court's injunction was proper as it specified a nonexclusive list of what could only be considered &quot;heavy construction equipment.&quot; However, to the extent the injunction could be interpreted to prohibit one non-family member employee from &quot;mobilizing&quot; for work on the landowners' premises, it was overbroad. The City's action was not an unconstitutional taking as the ordinance did not deprive the landowners of an economically beneficial use of the property.</SPAN></P>

One condition of his probation was the completion of sex offender treatment. His probation was later revoked for failure to complete treatment. The State petitioned for his commitment as a sexually dangerous individual. The petition included references to three other instances of alleged sexually predatory conduct. The trial court committed him. On appeal, he claimed that he was denied the right to confrontation because the experts testifying at the hearing based their opinions partially upon reports generated by individuals who were not available for cross-examination. The court held that the constitutional right to confrontation did not apply to civil commitments of sexually dangerous individuals. The trial court did not erroneously apply N.D. Cent. Code ch. 25-03.3. Respondent was afforded the opportunity to cross-examine the psychologists and to point out strengths and weaknesses of both the psychological evaluations performed and the evidence underlying their expert opinions.</SPAN></P>

The officer responded to the call, spotted the moving vehicle, and noticed there were no plates of any sort or any type of registration on the vehicle. The officer also personally recognized the driver as a suspended driver from a past call. The officer confirmed through a concealed weapons permit that the driver was defendant. The officer detected a strong odor of alcohol on defendant, informed defendant he was stopped for having no registration, and arrested defendant for driving under suspension. Defendant failed a field sobriety test and eventually agreed to submit to a blood-alcohol test which was administered at a hospital. The appellate court ruled that the officer had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant's vehicle. The officer's knowledge of the prior suspension one month earlier was not too stale to support a reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity. Also, there was no abuse of discretion in sentencing defendant to one year in prison, which was within the limits prescribed by N.D. Cent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Native American tribe members sued defendant state officials under federal and state law, seeking a declaration that the state fuel tax refund process was unlawful. The District Court of Mountrail County, Northwest Judicial District (North Dakota), denied the members' claim, denied their request for class certification, and granted them summary judgment as to the applicable statute of limitations. The members appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The refund process did not violate due process as it provided meaningful, backward-looking relief with a clear and certain remedy to rectify an alleged unlawful deprivation. Although an overly strict construction or technical application of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 57-43.1-04 could have violated due process, simply requiring the members to comply with the statutory refund procedure did not do so. The refund process did not violate equal protection where an amendment to N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 57-43.1-04 had removed the requirement that receipts for fuel purchases list tax as a separate item. When N.D. Cent. Code &sect;&sect; 57-43.1-03.2 and 57-43.1-04 were read together, the requirement that the purchased fuel had to be used in a non-licensed vehicle did not apply to Native Americans. The refund provision applied retroactively given the legislature's clear intent. The limitations period started six years from when the members' suit was commenced. The district court properly denied class certification as the only remaining issues were the individual damage amounts. The members were properly denied attorney fees as there was no statutory basis for an award and the common fund doctrine did not apply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment as to the statute of limitations look-back period was modified to provide that the members were entitled to refunds for fuel taxes paid after September 21, 1997. The permanent injunction was dissolved. The judgment was affirmed as modified.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that any error by the trial court in not giving a corroboration instruction was harmless because although there was no independent and direct evidence about the actual trigger person for the victim's death, the combined and cumulative effect of the other independent evidence tended to connect defendant to the murder and corroborated the wife's testimony. Further, assuming that a correctional specialist's testimony could have been construed as a comment about defendant's post-arrest silence, the court did not believe that testimony about defendant's effective denial of involvement in the murder was prejudicial to him or could have affected the outcome of the proceeding. Defendant was not denied a fair trial. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the State to introduce evidence of defendant's convictions in Wisconsin and North Dakota under N.D. R. Evid. 404(b).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.D. Cent.

The supreme court concluded that &sect; 28-01-46 required a plaintiff to show good cause before the case was dismissed, but because a defendant might file a motion to dismiss well after the 3-month period lapsed (as defendants had done in the case at hand), and because the plaintiff had the right to respond to that motion, the latest a plaintiff could show good cause would be in response to the motion to dismiss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In December 2004, defendant engaged in a sexual act with a woman who was under 15 years old. Defendant claimed he was more than four but less than five years older than the victim. He argued that 2005 legislative amendments to N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 12.1-20-03 should have applied in his case. The State argued that the age-in-relation-to-the-victim provision contained in the 2005 legislative amendments was a mitigating factor, not an element of the crime. The court concluded that the age-in-relation-to-the-victim provision in &sect; 12.1-20-03 was an essential element added by the legislature in 2005, but it was not an element in December 2004 when defendant committed the offense. Defendant was properly charged based on the law in effect when the crime occurred. Since the information properly charged each element of gross sexual imposition on the date of the offense, there was no defect in the information that would have entitled defendant to relief of either arrest of judgment or dismissal of his case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the ordinance violated his right to substantive due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment and N.D. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, because the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague on its face. The court concluded that the ordinance provided minimum guidelines for a reasonable police officer, judge, or jury charged with its enforcement and provided a reasonable person with adequate and fair warning of the prohibited conduct. Defendant's failure to prevent his dogs from barking excessively, continuously, or at the wrong time did not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. A neighbor testified he could hear the dogs barking off and on all day while he was inside his home. The neighbor complained to the police after the dogs allegedly had been barking after hours one evening between 8 and 9 p.m. Defendant's claim that he lacked notice of the prohibited conduct was damaged by the fact he hired a person not only to take care of his dogs but also to ensure they were inside his home by a certain time every night to prevent complaints about their barking. Only when the dogs were outside and barking after that time did the neighbor complain.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the ordinances did not violate the bars' First Amendment right to free speech because: (1) the city was regulating under a legitimate governmental power; (2) the ordinances did not completely eliminate adult entertainment; (3) the ordinances were aimed at combating the negative secondary effects caused by adult entertainment establishments rather than at the suppression of expression; (4) the ordinances served a substantial government interest; and (5) the ordinances were not overbroad and were narrowly tailored, as they were focused on the four walls of the barroom, and the detailed findings on the adverse secondary effects of adult establishments supported a broad disclosure requirement beyond obscenity-related criminal offenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Cass County, East Central Judicial District (North Dakota), denied defendant's motion to suppress. She entered a conditional plea of guilty of possession of a controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession of less than one-half ounce of marijuana. She reserved her right to appeal the denial of her motion to suppress evidence found in her purse and jacket, and to dismiss the charges. She appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying her motion to suppress evidence and dismiss the charges because the stop of her car was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment and N.D. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The State argued that the stop was constitutional because an officer had reasonable and articulable suspicion that she was committing a vehicle registration violation. The officer testified that he observed a car lacking license plates in possible violation of the vehicle registration laws. N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 39-04-17 allowed for a temporary paper certificate to be displayed on a vehicle for 30 days while a title application was being processed. Defendant's temporary registration sticker did not stick out as unusual. The officer stopped the car because, in his experience, many people drove on the sticker beyond the 30 days that was allotted. However, the officer's belief that many people violated the 30-day temporary registration law was an over-generalization that did not give rise to reasonable suspicion that defendant's automobile was not lawfully registered. Thus, the trial court improperly denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence obtained from her car.</SPAN></P>

Cent. Code &sect; 19-03.1-46 were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of methamphetamine, possession of methamphetamine paraphernalia, possession of marijuana paraphernalia, and possession of less than one half ounce of marijuana. The trial court decided that it would not impose a requirement for random drug testing as a condition of defendant's bail under &sect; 19-03.1-46 because it found the statutory requirement unconstitutional. The State dismissed the charge for possession of methamphetamine paraphernalia and defendant pled guilty to the other charges. On appeal, the court found that defendant's guilty plea rendered the issues raised in the appeal moot. The procedural posture of the case militated against the application of the exceptions to the mootness doctrine. The trial court had raised the issue of the constitutionality of the statute without briefing by any party and without notice to the attorney general. Defense counsel raised the issue only after embracing the trial court's invitation to do so. Because the trial court failed to follow established procedures and orderly process, the court vacated the order holding &sect; 19-03.1-46&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's application for a writ of prohibition addressed the inmate's right to earn good-time sentence reduction credits, the right to postage and copying costs so that the inmate could have access to the courts, and the inmate's privacy rights in legal documents. The inmate was no longer to earn a performance-based sentence reduction, pursuant to N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 12-54.1-01(1), because the inmate refused to participate in the sex-offender treatment program, maintaining that he was innocent of all charges. The court held that an original writ of prohibition with the court was not appropriate, because the inmate was seeking to enforce private rights. The court noted that in conformance with N.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2, a writ of prohibition was an extraordinary remedy to be granted within the court's discretion. The court would not exercise its original jurisdiction authority to vindicate the inmate's private rights, regardless of their importance. The original jurisdiction of the North Dakota Supreme Court was reserved for the use of the state itself when it appeared necessary to vindicate or protect the liberties of the people, or when the state's rights were directly affected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife brought the divorce action in 2003, and three children were born of the marriage. The husband earned approximately $ 60,000 annually working at a mine. The wife largely stayed home with the children and worked in positions that were part time or short term, and paid an hourly rate high enough to cover daycare expenses. The wife earned no more than $ 18,500 annually during the course of the marriage and was unemployed at the time of trial. The reviewing court held that the district court did not err by concluding the wife was entitled to rehabilitative support. The reviewing court held that it elected to dispose of the &quot;disadvantaged spouse&quot; doctrine and reemphasized the importance of a comprehensive analysis under the Ruff-Fischer guidelines when determining the appropriateness of rehabilitative spousal support. The wife had a substantially lower income-earning capacity than the husband, capable of making only minimum wage, compared to the husband's current income. The husband was in good health, but the wife had a number of health problems requiring regular treatment. The wife had very little property and significant debt.</SPAN></P>

Due process did not require a total or complete lack of control for the involuntary civil commitment of a sexually dangerous individual; rather, it required proof of serious difficulty in controlling behavior. The language in &sect; 25-03.3-01(8) required a causal relationship or nexus between an individual's disorder and dangerousness, which established a likelihood of reoffending. The civil procedure for committing such offenders also did not violate double jeopardy. The appellate court also rejected the argument that double jeopardy and due process were violated because the executive director had the authority to place the offender in an appropriate facility under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 25-03.3-13. The offender's procedural due process rights were adequately protected by the procedures in N.D. Cent.

Defendant argued that since his first DUI conviction occurred before the statute became effective, the department should have disqualified him from operating a commercial motor vehicle for only one year. He claimed that because the statute did not have express retroactivity language in the same subsection, it should not have been applied retroactively to him. The Supreme Court of North Dakota concluded that the commercial driver's license suspension statute was properly interpreted as including past DUI offenses as long as the triggering offense occurred after the effective date of the statute. The department's application of &sect; 39-06.2-10(8) was not retroactive merely because defendant's first DUI conviction in 2000 occurred before the effective date of the subsection.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both North Dakota and Wyoming were members of the Interstate Wildlife Violator Compact. The hunter argued, inter alia, that the Department erred in suspending his privileges on the basis of his Wyoming trespass to hunt conviction. The court concluded the hunter failed to establish that his statutory or constitutional rights were violated by the Department's suspension of his hunting privileges in North Dakota on the basis of his Wyoming conviction. It rejected the hunter's argument that the elements of hunting trespass under the North Dakota and Wyoming statutory schemes had to be identical before the Department could suspend the hunter's privileges on the basis of the Wyoming conviction. The purpose of the Compact was for participating states to promote compliance with the statutes, laws, ordinances, regulations, and administrative rules relating to management of wildlife resources in the participating states. The hunter's construction of the Compact would have undermined this purpose and stripped it of any real meaning because the wildlife laws of the participating state were not identical. In suspending the hunter's privileges, the Department did not misconstrue the Compact.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trooper observed that defendant's vehicle had tinted windows in violation of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 39-21-39. The trooper, however, had been asked to locate and stop the vehicle based on an anonymous tip that defendant might be carrying drugs. During the stop, defendant gave his consent to search, and his passenger was arrested on a suspended license violation. Defendant claimed the marijuana was unconstitutionally seized as a result of an extremely pretextual stop. Nevertheless, the officer's subjective intent was not relevant in determining probable cause. The stop of the vehicle was constitutional because the officer had probable cause to believe defendant was committing a tinted window violation. The fact that the car had been recently stopped for the same violation had no bearing on the constitutionality of the stop. The trooper had a valid basis to stop the vehicle, despite his subjective reasons for the stop; the supreme court concluded the district court properly refused to suppress the marijuana obtained from a search of the vehicle.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee North Dakota Tax Commissioner assessed appellant taxpayers additional back taxes, penalties, and interest. They appealed. The District Court of Burleigh County, South Central Judicial District (North Dakota), affirmed. The taxpayers sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers were part of a unitary business group that elected to apportion its income under the water's edge method allowed by N.D. Cent. Code. ch. 57-38.4. The taxpayers contended that the Commissioner erred in refusing to allow partial exclusion of I.R.C. &sect; 78 dividends they received because those were &quot;foreign dividends&quot; for purposes of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 57-38.4-02(2). The high court disagreed. Finding the statutes ambiguous, and reviewing the legislative history, it held that I.R.C. &sect; 78 &quot;deemed&quot; distributions were not foreign dividends for purposes of N.D. Cent. Code &sect;&sect; 57-38.4-01(4) and 57-38.4-02(2). The taxpayer argued that the Commissioner incorrectly included income of its 80/20 corporation and the dividends it paid its parent in the taxable income of the water's edge group, as this resulted in double taxation. The high court held that Commissioner's interpretation of this complex subject did not contradict the language of &sect; 57-38.4-02 and was entitled to deference. Further, a corporate income tax auditor testified at the administrative hearing that North Dakota had not engaged in double taxation, and the administrative law judge found this testimony credible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant North Dakota Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) challenged a decision from the District Court of Burleigh County, South Central Judicial District (North Dakota), which reversed DFI's order directing appellee collection agency to cease its electronic collection of fees for checks that were returned for insufficient funds (NSF). The agency also sought review of a portion of the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DFI filed a proceeding against the agency, contending that it was violating certain laws by charging fees for NSF checks without the permission of the customer. The DFI entered a cease and desist order, and the agency sought review. DFI's decision was overturned, and the agency was awarded attorney's fees and costs. DFI then sought review. In affirming, the court determined that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 6-08-16 was not ambiguous. There was nothing prohibiting the agency from electronically debiting fees in this manner. Further, the agency's actions were governed by the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1693 et seq., and Regulation E, 12 C.F.R. pt. 205. The court rejected DFI's argument that the agency was not giving adequate notice under Regulation E. In addition, North Dakota's version of the Uniform Commercial Code was not applicable to electronic debits of NSF collection fees, and no other North Dakota law regulated electronic fund transactions. The agency did not receive adequate notice of the claim under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Finally, the award of attorney's fees was proper because the action was not substantially justified.</SPAN></P>

He moved for post-conviction relief, seeking to withdraw his plea. The trial court denied his request for an evidentiary hearing. He appealed, asserting the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion for default summary judgment based on the State's untimely response to his motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 29-32.1-06(1) provided that within 30 days after the docketing of an application for post-conviction relief or within any further time the district court might allow, the State was required to respond. However, the 30 day time limit was not mandatory. In the instant case, the district court had reviewed all of the transcripts regarding petitioner's guilty plea and found no merit to his application. Likewise, petitioner failed to show prejudice. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner's request for default judgment. Secondly, the appellate court had not previously addressed the issue of whether a request to withdraw a guilty plea in a post-conviction relief proceeding was timely. However, Minnesota appellate courts allowed for withdrawal of one's plea in a post-conviction action to &quot;correct a manifest injustice.&quot; Petitioner did not challenge the voluntariness of his guilty plea even after his sentence was executed following a probation violation. He failed to move for post-conviction relief for more than six years after his plea. Thus, his request to withdraw was untimely under N.D. R. Crim. P. 32(d).</SPAN></P>

The appellate court noted that a two-step analysis had to be undertaken to determine whether the allegedly defamatory statement was subject to a qualified privilege and, if so, whether the privilege was abused. The alleged defamatory statement enjoyed a qualified privilege which was not abused because the candidate failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact whether the statement was a fair and true report of a judicial proceeding and was made without malice, with reasonable belief in its truthfulness, and was based on a subject matter relevant to the common interest. Because the reporter and the newspaper were immune from liability, the company could not be liable. The candidate's argument that N.D. Cent.

The trial court ordered that the father pay the North Dakota Department of Human Services for support provided from November 2000 through May 2002. On appeal, the father contended that the statutes authorizing administrative child support guidelines did not authorize the use of imputed income. The court found that the father's premise that the North Dakota child support guidelines created an irrebuttable minimum payment was wrong. The father's affidavit in response to the motion to amend the amended judgment contained nothing about his ability to pay child support.

Although defendant argued that his arrest was not a lawful warrantless arrest under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 29-06-15, the court, without a transcript on appeal, had to infer that defendant failed to provide evidence supporting the defense of unlawful police conduct under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 12.1-08-02; hence, the trial court did not err by not submitting the question to the jury. The verdict had to be interpreted as finding that the officers did not use excessive force and that defendant was not justified under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 12.1-05-03(1) in using force to resist the arrest. Defendant's claims of instructional error were not preserved for appeal under N.D. R. Crim. P. 30(c), and plain error under N.D. R. Crim. P. 52(b) could not be found without a transcript.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the State lacked jurisdiction to prosecute him because he committed the offense at his computer in Minnesota, but the court disagreed, stating that he offered to pick up the &quot;girl&quot; at a designated convenience store in North Dakota. The police observed him at that convenience store, and he was arrested in North Dakota. Thus, the language of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 29-03-01.1 applied to defendant, and he was subjected to prosecution in the State. Further, N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 12.1-20-02.4 did not violate the Commerce Clause or the First Amendment, and the registration and notification provisions of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 12.1-32-15 did not violate procedural due process or double jeopardy, as the registration requirement was part and parcel of the conviction for the offense and was not a separate proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the forfeiture provisions of N.D. Cent.

The appellate court further held that once the State established probable cause to believe the property was forfeitable, the burden of proof shifted to the inmate to prove that the property was not forfeitable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a social worker for Cass County, sought to terminate parental rights to an Indian child, and respondent, the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians (Tribe), moved under the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) to transfer jurisdiction to a tribal court. A referee recommended denying the motion, and the Juvenile Court of Cass County, East Central Judicial District (North Dakota), reversed and granted the transfer. The county appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In affirming the transfer, the court held that N.D. Sup. Ct. R.P.R. Admin. R. &amp; Admin. Orders 13, &sect; 11(b) did not require the juvenile court to allow a response from the county before considering the request for review of the referee's decision. The motion to transfer jurisdiction was timely. Absent good cause to the contrary, 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1911(b) created presumptive tribal court jurisdiction in any custody proceedings involving an Indian child, and the relevant time period was the filing of the termination petition, not the initiation of the foster care proceeding. The court rejected the characterization that filing the motion seven weeks after the termination petition and two weeks before the scheduled trial was the eve of trial. The tribal court was not an inconvenient forum because it had offered to sit in Fargo for the proceedings. With regard to substantive due process and equal protection challenges, the court applied the rational basis test and concluded that the ICWA, 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1901 et seq., was rationally related to the protection of the integrity of American Indian families and tribes and to the fulfillment of Congress's guardianship obligation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held a hearing in August 2002 to review its April 2002 order, and, after the husband testified at that hearing, the court ordered the South Central Child Support Enforcement Unit to verify information the husband provided. The Enforcement Unit objected to the court's order, arguing that it violated N.D. Cent.

The Unit never conducted an investigation and, while its appeal was pending, the trial court entered a third amended judgment that modified the husband's child support obligation. The state supreme court held that the Unit's appeal was moot and, because it did not involve an issue of great public interest, the court would dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>

The husband became ill in 1999 and it was discovered that he was still diabetic. The husband died of complications related to diabetes in 2002. The husband argued on appeal that the statute of repose was unconstitutional, that the doctrine of equitable estoppel precluded the doctor from raising the statute of repose, and that North Dakota should adopt the continuous treatment rule. The appellate court held that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 28-01-18(3) did not violate equal protection because there was a close correspondence between the statutory classification and the goals of the legislature in adopting the statute. A claim of equitable estoppel could not be based on the same act as the act that allegedly constituted the act of negligence. The court would not consider whether to adopt the continuous treatment rule because, even if it were to adopt the rule, it would not apply because the husband was not treated by the doctor after 1992.</SPAN></P>

While an appeal was pending, police officers searched the office of a private investigator. The police seized statements connected to the inmate's case.

After the trial court denied the petition, the inmate sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the trial court's decision to deny the petition was not clearly erroneous. The inmate's right to assistance of counsel precluded direct restrictions upon the function of counsel in defending a criminal prosecution. However, there was no evidence of direct prosecutorial misconduct. The officers had a search warrant, the conduct occurred after the inmate's conviction, and the inmate failed to show that he was prejudiced.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1992, the inmate was convicted of felony murder. In 2001, he was required to give a DNA sample, in accordance with N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 31-13-03 (2001). The inmate then filed a motion to quash the order and for an injunction to stay the collection of the DNA sample. After the district court determined that &sect; 31-13-03 applied to the inmate retroactively, he was ordered to provide the sample. The inmate then sought review. In affirming, the court determined that &sect; 31-13-03 did apply retroactively. Because the statute itself was ambiguous, the court looked to the legislative history, which demonstrated the legislature's intent to further expand the DNA data based. This goal would have been advanced only by including inmates that were already incarcerated. Moreover, the district court had no discretion in ordering the inmate to provide a sample. The court declined to consider the inmate's Ex Post Facto Clause challenge because it was not adequately briefed. Finally, the court determined that 31-13-03 did not violate the inmate's right against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Florida corporations had oil and gas properties in North Dakota, and they paid North Dakota corporate income taxes on that income. The Florida corporations also received dividend income from other corporations conducting business primarily outside of North Dakota. The State determined those dividends were business income subject to apportionment, and to the extent the State determined the dividends were includable in the taxpayers' North Dakota apportioned income, the State applied the dividends received deduction under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 57-38-01.3(1)(g), which authorized adjustments to a corporation's taxable income. The issue under a four-part test utilized in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, was whether the dividends received deduction discriminated against interstate commerce. The appellate court found that the State's comparative tax hypothetical to justify the tax ignored the effective imposition of a double layer of tax on a corporation's out-of-state income, but not on in-state income. The appellate court held that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 57-38-01.3(1)(g) violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, and was invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner, who was incarcerated for aggravated assault and felonious restraint, refused to submit a DNA sample by oral swab. He resisted and challenged the constitutionality of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 31-13-03 on several grounds, including his right to equal protection. The trial court subsequently denied the State's motion to require him to submit to DNA testing, concluding N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 31-13-03 violated his equal protection rights under the United States Constitution. The appellate court initially noted the rational basis test applied to equal protection challenges to statutes authorizing DNA testing because convicted persons had a diminished expectation of privacy and did not have a fundamental right to be free from tests for DNA genetic marking. The appellate court held N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 31-13 authorized DNA tests for persons convicted of the additional enumerated non-sexual offenses and to expand the centralized state DNA data base to include those DNA test results. The appellate court concluded N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 31-13-03 was rationally related to a legitimate government purpose and satisfied the rational basis standard of review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that: (1) defendant's motion to suppress was too vague and general to provide adequate notice of the basis for his motion to suppress; and (2) the trial court erred in granting defendant's motion, because the arresting officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal conduct when he ordered defendant to exit his vehicle and the officer's directive did not defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. The instant court concluded that defendant's motion to suppress complied with N.D. R. Crim. P. 47 because it adequately apprised the State of the basis for the relief requested. The instant court also concluded that if defendant was parked on an elevated structure, within the meaning of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 39-10-49(13) when the officer approached defendant, then the officer had reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity when he ordered defendant to exit his vehicle and the officer did not violate defendant's Fourth Amendment rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State received a permanent injunction against defendant to enjoin him from hauling and storing trash, junk, and other refuse on property owned by his girlfriend. The State then brought a criminal complaint against him for disobeying the judicial order, he was found guilty, and he was placed on supervised probation. After defendant failed to comply with either order, the trial court revoked defendant's probation and, again, placed him on probation with the condition that he not enter upon the property. Defendant appealed, arguing the probation condition precluded him from entering the property and thereby prevented him from exercising his First Amendment right to associate with his girlfriend. The appellate court held the trial court's imposition of the probation condition was reasonably related to the goals of probation and protected the rights of law-abiding citizens from the economic, aesthetic, and public health aspects of defendant's hoarding behavior. The appellate court concluded the condition only restricted defendant's right to associate with his girlfriend on a limited basis and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

In April 1999, the North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau (Bureau) began investigating the employee. The Bureau videotaped the employee engaged in various physical activities and determined that he had made a false claim to the Bureau. The appellate court held that the employee was not deprived his due process rights because the Bureau terminated his benefits without an evidentiary hearing as the employee had notice of the termination of benefits, a summary of the Bureau's evidence, and the opportunity to respond in writing. The Bureau was not required to find that the employee made a wilfully false statement to terminate his benefits; the Bureau's finding that the employee misrepresented his physical condition was sufficient.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sledders were seriously injured while sledding on a hill at a golf course, which was owned, operated, and maintained by the district. During the winter, about 100 acres of the recreational complex were open free of charge to the general public for sledding, snowboarding, tobogganing, and cross-country skiing. The hill had not been altered from its natural state and was not groomed or maintained for sledding. Warning signs were posted at the top of the hill to caution people. The sledders argued that the district negligently failed to maintain the sledding area in a safe and hazard-free condition for its users. The supreme court ruled that under the circumstances of the case, the limited liability afforded the district for recreational use of property under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 53-08-01 et seq. did not violate the equal protection provisions of N.D. Const. art. I, &sect; 21. The recreational use immunity statutes advanced the important legislative goal of opening property to the public for recreational use in a manner that closely corresponded to the achievement of that goal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A legislative redistricting plan reduced the number of senatorial districts from 49 to 47, fixed the number of senators and representatives, and divided the state into senatorial districts. The senator contended that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 54-03-01.8, as amended in 2001, truncated his four-year senate term to two years and thereby violated N.D. Const. art. IV, &sect; 4, requiring a senator's term to be four years. The supreme court held that the language in &sect; 54-03-01.8 that allowed an incumbent state senator to decide whether to stop an election for state senator was an impermissible delegation of legislative power. However, by allowing an election for state senator, &sect; 54-03-01.8 provided the electors in the newly drawn district their constitutional right to elect a state senator. Construing all provisions of the state constitution together, the supreme court concluded that a senator generally had to be elected for a term of four years, but the legislature could truncate senate terms when reasonably necessary to accomplish another constitutional mandate. The supreme court held that the remainder of &sect; 54-03-01.8, in truncating the senator's term, did not violate N.D. Const. art. IV. &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>

The husband failed to vacate the residence by the date set in the amended judgment. On appeal, the husband asserted a number of arguments in support of his contention that the trial court erred in granting the wife's request for eviction. The instant court noted that the husband's argument that the trial court violated his homestead rights and the state constitution by evicting him from the residence was an impermissible collateral attack on the amended judgment itself. Regarding the husband's argument that, under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 14-05-25.1, a contempt proceeding was the only method the wife could use to enforce the divorce judgment, the instant court concluded that the statute did not bar the eviction action. Because the husband was continuing to possess the property in violation of the amended judgment, an eviction action against him was maintainable. The husband's argument that the trial court was without jurisdiction to enter the eviction order because he filed his appeal from the eviction order before the written eviction order was filed was without merit.</SPAN></P>

The instant court concluded that the phrase &quot;likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct&quot; as used in the statute means that a person's propensity towards sexual violence is of such a degree as to pose a threat to others. This definition prevented a contest over percentage points and the results of other actuarial tools, and it allowed experts to use the fullness of their education, experience and resources available to them in order to determine if the person poses a threat to society.

Following her release from prison, she was placed under supervised probation for five years, which included restitution. The District Court of Cass County, East Central Judicial District (North Dakota), granted defendant's motion to vacate the restitution order because she was not present at the hearing, but held a second hearing at which defendant was present.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court found defendant had the ability to pay $ 200 per month in restitution and good cause existed to extend her probation period for five years. Defendant argued the district court lacked the authority to &quot;increase&quot; her sentence because it acted outside the time limit imposed by N.D. R. Crim. P. 35. The appellate court held that defendant confused the nature of her restitution. Her restitution was a condition of her probation. The conditions of her probation were modified; her sentence was not. Therefore, her reliance upon Rule 35 was misplaced. If restitution was imposed, the court could, following a restitution hearing pursuant to N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 12.1-32-08, impose an additional period of probation not to exceed five years. The second restitution hearing was held pursuant to &sect; 12.1-32-08. Contrary to defendant's assertions, &sect; 12.1-32-08 did not require a restitution hearing to be held prior to a sentencing hearing. The district court acted within its statutory authority in extending her probation for an additional five years, and an extension of a probation period did not subject defendant to double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was not placed in jeopardy by the charges dismissed before trial, so there could be no double jeopardy created by the single trial.

On appeal from defendant's convictions, the Supreme Court of North Dakota held: (1) the superior court reasonably excluded the evidence because the evidence did not indicate the assaults on defendant were directed at the children, thus the evidence was not relevant; (2) the superior court did not abuse its discretion when it required the parties to make additional closing argument to the jury prior to any further indication by the jury that they were at an impasse; (3) that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 14-14-22.1 was repealed and the saving statute of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 1-02-17 applied; and (4) N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 1-02-17 was clear and unambiguous in saving the penalties and fines but not the imprisonment portion of that repealed statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile court found that the children were deprived and removed them from the home. Nine months later, the State petitioned to terminate the parents' parental rights, alleging numerous incidents of child abuse or neglect. The evidence showed unsanitary conditions, creating serious health risks for the children, the father's narcotics arrest while he was with his child, an overall lack of parental supervision, and psychological maltreatment of the children. The parents objected to the admission of testimony and reports of medical professionals who had treated the parents. The North Dakota Supreme Court found that: (1) the juvenile court did not err in admitting into evidence the reports and testimony of the medical professionals because N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 50-25.1-10 abrogated the privilege in N.D. R. Evid. 503 in cases involving reports of alleged child abuse or neglect; (2) the constitutional issue was not preserved for review; (3) any error in the juvenile court's procedure of admitting the evidence was harmless error because the other evidence was overwhelming; and (4) there was clear and convincing evidence to support the termination of the parents' parental rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's property was adjacent to the city, and had at all times been zoned for agricultural use. The owner sought to have the property zoned for residential development, and then annexed. The city commission rejected two petitions for annexation, leading to the owner's action in court. The trial court ruled that declaratory and injunctive relief were unavailable to challenge a municipality's decision to reject a petition for annexation. The supreme court affirmed, because the determination whether to annex land to a municipality was a legislative act, and declaratory and injunctive relief could not be used to challenge the wisdom, propriety, or correctness of the decision. Second, there was no unconstitutional taking of the property, as the owner did not show that the city's refusal to annex his property and zone it for apartment buildings deprived him of all or substantially all reasonable uses of the land. Although its value for future residential development was hampered by its proximity to a railroad, that adverse consequence was present long before, and was not caused by, the city's failure to annex the property.</SPAN></P>

The trial court appropriately controlled the presentation of evidence during respondent's case, and appellant failed to call respondent as part of his case.

He received federal disaster payments for losses to his crops. Under federal regulations, appellant was then required to carry multi-peril crop insurance. According to appellant, appellee agent agreed to provide multi-peril insurance on appellant's crops, but did not do so. On April 3, 1995, appellant was informed he had to repay certain federal disaster payments because he did not have the required multi-peril crop insurance. Appellant then sued both appellees on April 23, 1997. After appellees' summary judgment motion was granted on the basis that the two-year statute of limitations against licensed insurance agents of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 26.1-26-51 applied, the appellate court found the statute was unambiguous. The statute's plain language barred actions commenced after July 31, 1995 if those actions were not filed within two years of the date they accrued.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, driver and her insurer, appealed a judgment from the District Court of Cass County, East Central Judicial District (North Dakota), dismissing their tort claims for damages and denying their motion for a new trial. Defendant driver cross appealed an order denying his motion to dismiss plaintiff insurer's subrogation claim against him for damages sustained by accident victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the special verdict form the jury found plaintiff driver was negligent and her negligence was a proximate cause of a traffic accident. The jury found defendant driver was neither negligent nor a proximate cause of the accident, but the jury apportioned fault for the accident 75 percent to plaintiff and 25 percent to defendant. In open court with the parties present, the trial judge had a discussion with the jury. The jury's answers to the special verdict clearly demonstrated the jurors did not understand or correctly apply the law as given to them in the case, and their confusion was not resolved during the jury's communications with the court. Plaintiffs were denied a fair trial and were entitled to a new trial under N.D. R. Civ. P. 59(b)(1) because of the irregularity of the proceedings when the court communicated with the jury during deliberations. While the court held its discussions with the jury in open court, with the parties present, the court so injected itself into the jury deliberation process on the merits that the parties were denied their right to have the jury determine the facts on the instructions given to them as approved by the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order denying defendant's motion to dismiss plaintiff insurer's claim under its assignment from accident victim was affirmed. Judgment denying plaintiffs' motion for new trial reversed and remanded for a new trial. Jury verdict was inconsistent and irreconcilable and the trial court erred in its communication with the jury during the deliberation process. The trial court, therefore, abused its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Appellee committed a traffic offense resulting in six points assessed against her driving record, and appellant, the state department of transportation, cancelled her driver's license. Following an appeal of the decision by appellee, the trial court reversed the license cancellation, holding that applying &sect; 39-06-01.1 to appellee was an unconstitutional ex post facto application and violated her due process right to proper notice. On appeal, appellant argued that it appropriately canceled appellee's driver's license. The court ruled that a statute was applied retroactively if it operated on transactions that already occurred, or on rights existing before its enactment.

Pursuant to N.D. R. App. P. 47, the federal district court certified the question of whether or not the North Dakota statute of repose for products liability actions, N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 28-01.3-08, unconstitutional under N.D. Const. art. I, &sect; 21 because it denied to plaintiffs equal protection of the law. The court held that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 28-01.3-08 created an unconstitutional classification in violation of N.D. Const. art. I, &sect; 21. The court held that there was not a close correspondence between the legislative objectives under N.D. Cent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee claimant received disability benefits following an accident while working as a truck driver for appellee employer. Appellee employer made three new job offers, which appellee claimant refused because the jobs were in North Dakota and he lived in California. Appellant, the workers' compensation agency, denied appellee claimant further disability benefits, finding that he voluntarily limited his income by refusing the job offers. Appellant agency challenged the reversal of its decision, which was based on appellant agency's ex parte contacts with outside legal counsel during the pendency of an administrative law judge's recommendation. The court found the contacts violated N.D. Cent. Code &sect;65-01-16(8) and N.D. Cent. Code ch. 28-32. Appellant agency was permitted to consult with such counsel, but those communications could not be ex parte. The court remanded for a rehearing on whether a reasonable person would have refused the job offers under N.D. Cent. Code &sect;65-05-08(7).</SPAN></P>

D. Cent. Code &sect; 14-07.1-06.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant felon was charged and convicted with violation of a domestic violence protection order under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 14-07.1-06. Defendant appealed the criminal conviction. On appeal, now represented by court-appointed counsel, defendant argued that he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to counsel in the trial court. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. It is not necessary that the record show an unequivocal express statement indicating a defendant's desire to proceed pro se, but a defendant's conduct may be the functional equivalent of a voluntary waiver of the right to counsel. Defendant was not a stranger to the criminal justice system, but an experienced criminal defendant, and his prior contacts with the legal system were sufficient to make him aware of the benefits of counsel and the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation. The court concluded that the record was not silent and established that defendant's functional waiver of his right to counsel was knowingly and intelligently made.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. The record reflected that defendant voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived right to counsel. Defendant's pretrial conduct and manipulative pattern of delay, his prior experience with the criminal justice system, and his awareness of benefits of counsel and dangers of self-representation indicated that he decided to proceed pro se, fully understanding the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff husband sought review of an order from the District Court of Grand Forks County, Northeast Central Judicial District (North Dakota), which dismissed his action against defendants, the State of North Dakota and judges, for violation of his legal and constitutional rights during proceedings stemming from his divorce. Defendants requested appellate attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband brought an action against defendants, claiming his legal and constitutional rights were denied during proceedings stemming from his divorce. He requested declaratory and injunctive relief to change the venue of his child support action, a retroactive child support review hearing, a finding that absolute judicial immunity was unconstitutional, and any other injunctive relief available. The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint under N.D. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(vi) for failure to state a claim. On appeal, the court found that even if the judges disregarded clear case or statutory law, their actions were judicial acts. Judicial immunity, pursuant to N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 32-12.2-02(3)(d), barred the husband's claims for money damages. Further, if the husband was unhappy with the judges' decisions, his remedy was to appeal the decisions or petition for rehearing. He failed to use the remedies available to redress any wrongs he might have suffered, and collateral estoppel barred him from relitigating the issues in a second action. Finally, defendants were entitled to appellate attorney fees because the husband's appeal was frivolous under N.D. R. App. P. 38.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that defendants were entitled to appellate attorney fees. The court remanded the case to the trial court for a determination of reasonable appellate attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
