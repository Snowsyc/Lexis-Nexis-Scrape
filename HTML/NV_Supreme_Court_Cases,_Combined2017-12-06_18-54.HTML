</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the organization's procurement of the TPO on the victim's behalf, after speaking with her by telephone, violated the procedure set forth in Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33.020(5) and violated his due process rights. The supreme court noted that the validity of a TPO was not an element that the State had to prove for the crime of home invasion or for a sentence enhancement for the violation of a TPO. Until the order was dissolved or modified or expired by its terms, it had to be obeyed. As defendant did not challenge the TPO in the issuing court, the supreme court could not consider his arguments pertaining to the TPO's validity in the appeal. Sufficient evidence existed to convict defendant of a home invasion in violation of a TPO, Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 193.166(1)(a), 205.067(1), as he went to the apartment where the victim was living and forcibly entered it without permission. The home invasion statute was constitutional. Trespass was not a lesser included offense of home invasion. The State's remarks constituted harmless error and did not substantially affect the jury's verdict. Defendant was properly ordered to pay $500 to the Indigent Defense Fund.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit certified a question pursuant to Nev. R. App. P. 5 regarding the constitutionality of Nevada Senate Bill No. 358 (S.B. 358), in which the legislature adopted amendments that prohibited Clark County from rezoning land in certain areas adjacent to Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area, including land owned by respondent landowner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner argued that S.B. 358 was a local or special law that regulated county business and established a system of county government that was not uniform throughout the State, in violation of Neb. Const. art. 4, &sect;&sect; 20, 21, and 25. The owner argued that S.B. 358 did not fall within any exception. The supreme court found that S.B. 358 was a local law for the purposes of &sect; 20 as it operated over only one particular portion of Nevada. S.B. 358 did regulate county business by permanently divesting the county of its zoning power of the adjacent lands; thus, it violated &sect; 20. S.B. 358 violated &sect; 21 because it was a local law that fell within an enumerated category of &sect; 20. S.B. 358 violated &sect; 25 because it established a system of county government that was not uniform throughout the State. S.B. 358 did not pass the first part of the Conservation District test, as the regulation of county business was enumerated in &sect; 20. There was no natural resource justification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city filed an eminent domain action in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada), to acquire a strip of property from respondent landowner, and the landowner counterclaimed for inverse condemnation. The trial court entered partial summary judgment against the city and partly granted the landowner's request for attorney fees. The city and the landowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city wanted to use the strip for a road project. The landowner's predecessor received the land pursuant to a federal land patent which subjected the land to a right-of-way for roadway and public utilities purposes. The supreme court held it was error for the trial court to hold the land patent did not grant the city an easement because (1) the federal patent's use of the terms &quot;right-of-way&quot; and &quot;subject to&quot; created an easement on the land for roadway and public utility purposes, and (2) the city was entitled to use the easement, despite not being specifically named, as the patent's language created a public easement, and any ambiguities had to be construed in favor of the government. The city's use of the easement for a road project was not a taking, under Nev. Const. art. I, &sect; 8(6), because (1) the easement's use fit within its scope articulated in the federal land patent, stating it was subject to an easement for &quot;roadway&quot; and &quot;public utilities&quot; purposes, and (2) the patent did not state roadways could be created only if they directly benefited owners of property issued pursuant to the Small Tract Act, former 43 U.S.C.S. &sect; 682a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment finding the city had no easement on the subject land was reversed, and its award of attorney fees was vacated. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a pretrial petition for writ of habeas corpus and/or motion to dismiss the indictment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was originally charged via criminal complaint with failure to notify agencies of a change in address. Appellant filed a motion to dismiss. The parties agreed to reset the preliminary hearing to the State could file an opposition, but the State did not, and the justice court granted the motion to dismiss. Later, the State obtained an indictment against appellant for the same offense. Appellant filed for habeas corpus relief and/or dismissal, claiming the State acted with conscious indifference when it failed to oppose the motion to dismiss. The trial court denied the petition, and appellant was convicted. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction. The trial court erred in finding that the State's failure to oppose the motion to dismiss the complaint did not amount to conscious indifference, given that (1) the State had been served with appellant's motion to dismiss and did not oppose it, (2) the State was on notice that its failure to oppose could be see as an admission that the motion had merit, (3) no explanation was offered for the failure to act, and (4) the prompt filing for reconsideration did not excuse the State's failure to timely respond to appellant's motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury of the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada, convicted defendant of attempted murder, assault, battery, and other crimes based on his actions in a single incident with a single victim. A jury of the Second Judicial District Court, Washoe County, convicted another defendant, for acts in a street fight, of murdering one victim, and, as to two other victims, attempted murder and battery. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of Nevada held that no violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause arose from the multiple punishments for convictions, arising from single incidents, of attempted murder, assault with deadly weapon, and battery with deadly weapons because each offense contained an element not contained in the other. The court disapproved of Salazar v. State, 119 Nev. 224, 70 P.3d 749 (2003); Skiba v. State, 114 Nev. 612, 959 P.2d 959 (1998); Albitre v. State, 103 Nev. 281, 284, 738 P.2d 1307, 1309 (1987); and their &quot;redundancy&quot; progeny, to the extent that they endorsed a fact-based &quot;same conduct&quot; test for determining the permissibility of cumulative punishment. Rather than a focus on the facts or evidence in a specific case, the proper focus is on legislative authorization, beginning with an analysis of the statutory text. If the Legislature has authorized--or interdicted--cumulative punishment, that legislative directive controls. Absent express legislative direction, the Blockburger test is employed. Blockburger licenses multiple punishment unless, analyzed in terms of their elements, one charged offense is the same or a lesser-included offense of the other.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada, rejected the majority of appellant Nevada Highway Patrol Officers' claims against respondents and upholding all but one of the Clark County code sections pertaining to inquest proceedings related to officer-involved deaths. The judgment also dissolved the temporary restraining order and denied injunctive relief. The officers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officers argued that their due process rights under the Nevada Constitution would be violated if they were forced to participate in the coroner's inquest process under the procedures set forth in the Clark County, Nevada, Code of Ordinances for inquests involving officer-involved deaths. The supreme court noted that under caselaw, the inquest process constituted an investigatory, rather than an adjudicatory, proceeding. As a result, due process protections were not triggered by the inquest process. Because Clark County had an appointed coroner, Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 259.050(4) did not apply, and thus, justices of the peace were not authorized to participate in Clark County inquest proceedings. Respondent Clark County Board of County Commissioners unconstitutionally impinged on the Legislature's constitutionally delegated authority, Nev. Const. art. 6, &sect; 8, by providing for the participation of justices of the peace in Clark County's inquest proceedings related to officer-involved deaths. Clark County, Nev. Code of Ordinances &sect; 2.12.010(1) violated the Constitution. The entire inquest scheme for officer-involved deaths necessarily had to be struck down.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada, convicted defendant, pursuant to an Alford plea, of two counts of conspiracy to commit the crime of compensation for registration of voters.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that the central issue was whether Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 293.805's prohibition on the payment of individuals based upon the number of voters registered violated U.S. Const. amend. I. Because &sect; 293.805 did not place a severe burden on First Amendment rights, the supreme court considered the validity of &sect; 293.805 pursuant to a less exacting standard of review. Because the statute's restriction on per-application and per-party payment of canvassers was narrow and an organization still had the ability to hire and pay voter registration canvassers, the statute did not result in a significant injury to First Amendment rights. Nevada had an important regulatory interest in preventing voter-registration fraud. The State's interest was sufficiently weight to justify &sect; 293.805's limitation on the payment of canvassers. The term &quot;register&quot; as used in the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The term &quot;based upon&quot; in &sect; 293.805 was not vague. A person who violated the statute would know that they were violating the statute. The intent would apply to the payment of workers based upon the number of voters registered.</SPAN></P>

Respondent was charged with possessing an item commonly used for the purpose of escaping from custody. A pretrial petition for a writ of habeas corpus was filed to dismiss the charge on the grounds that &sect; 212.093(1) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and that its terms did not prohibit the possession of cell phones. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court did not consider the constitutionality of the statute as the plain language supported the dismissal of the charge. The items specified in the statute were those that could either be used to forcibly manipulate the confines of a jail cell, like a picklock or wire cutters, or to physically exit from a jail cell, like ropes or ladders. The omission of cell phones appeared to be deliberate as Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 212.165(3) specifically prohibited inmates in state prisons from having cell phones without lawful authorization; this prohibition did not apply to county jail inmates.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father, as guardian for his daughter, appealed a summary judgment for respondents, a hospital and the doctors, entered by the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada), in a medical malpractice suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court held that the accrual date for Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41A.097(2)'s one-year discovery period ordinarily presented a fact issue for the jury. When the evidence irrefutably showed that a plaintiff was put on inquiry notice, the trial court could determine the discovery date as a matter of law. The father was on inquiry notice, but not when he was informed that his daughter was brain dead as the trial court held. Rather, the father was put on inquiry notice when he was provided with a complete set of the hospital's records. Factual issues remained as to whether the hospital concealed records from the father so as to warrant tolling &sect; 41A.097(2)'s discovery period. The father was to be given a chance to show that the hospital intentionally withheld records that would have hindered a reasonably diligent plaintiff from procuring an expert affidavit. The summary judgment was affirmed as to the doctors since the hospital's alleged concealment could not serve as a basis for tolling &sect; 41A.097(2)'s statutory limitation periods as to the doctors, who played no role in the concealment. The claims against the doctors were time-barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The summary judgment for the hospital was vacated, and the case was remanded so that the father could be afforded an opportunity to show that the hospital intentionally withheld records that would have hindered a reasonably diligent plaintiff from procuring an expert affidavit. The summary judgment for the doctors was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada, granted summary judgment in favor of respondent lender on its breach of contract and personal guaranty claims against appellant debtor. The district court found that the debtor's defenses and counterclaims were barred by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1821. The debtor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtor argued that FIRREA did not apply because the proceedings below involved the lender rather than the FDIC and because the FDIC failed to mail him notice of the specified bar date for filing his claims against the bank. The supreme court found that with respect to claims relating to acts or omissions of the failed bank, a successor in interest was entitled to benefit from FIRREA's jurisdictional bar. FIRREA's jurisdictional bar did not apply to defenses or affirmative defenses. Based on his allegations, the debtor may be able to demonstrate that he was entitled to recoup against any amount awarded the lender on its claims, up to the amount awarded. Because the debtor's affirmative defense raised unresolved questions of material fact, and because affirmative defenses were not barred by FIRREA, the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the lender on its breach of contract and breach of personal guaranty claims.</SPAN></P>

One of the children died as a result of the injuries. Appellant was convicted and sentenced to death. He unsuccessfully sought a new trial, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the supreme court determined that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 175.556 did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VIII. Next, a new trial was not warranted in this case. There was no proof of intrinsic misconduct by the jury foreperson, and the jury did not consider extraneous information. The foreperson also did not intentionally conceal any bias against appellant. An argument that the federal constitution required that aggravating circumstances and the balancing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances be alleged in the charging document was rejected. Challenges to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty were rejected. There was no error in admitting appellant's statement or a letter he wrote while incarcerated. Even though one comment made by a prosecutor was improper, it was harmless. Finally, a death sentence was properly imposed under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 177.055(2).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Fourth Judicial District Court, Elko County, Nevada, that convicted him of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 202.360, arguing that his conviction violated the right to keep and bear arms as secured by U.S. Const. amend. II and Nev. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that, despite his felon status, he had a constitutional right to possess a black powder rifle. On review, the court held that, while federal law currently permits felons to possess black powder rifles, that did not mandate that Nevada follow suit. The choice as to whether to deny felons the right to possess any and all firearms, as Nevada has done, or to permit them to possess antique firearms and black powder rifles, as Congress has done, was legislative, not judicial. Without a constitutional imperative demanding more exacting review, such distinctions did not invalidate state laws that differed from their federal counterpart. Further, the constitutional right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to keep and bear arms in the defense of hearth and home did not extend to felons. Because gun rights were among the rights of citizenship or the civil rights that a felon has historically been seen as losing by reason of conviction in Nevada, it was reasonable to read the reference to every citizen in Nev. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11(1) to exclude unpardoned felons.</SPAN></P>

Defendant failed to show that the testimony and documentary evidence of his prior drug conviction and social history were inadmissible, Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 176.156(5). The weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances was not a fact-finding endeavor and the district court did not err in refusing to give the requested instruction. Defendant's requested instruction was properly rejected because it did not correctly state the weighing determination required by the Nevada statutes. Defendant failed to show that the late notice of evidence in aggravation prejudiced him in his defense of the great-risk-of-death aggravator. The evidence was sufficient for a rational juror to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knowingly created a great risk of death to others as contemplated by Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 200.033(3). The jury's verdict was supported by sufficient evidence. The death sentence was properly imposed and was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 201.300(1)(a), a defendant had to act with the specific intent of inducing his target to become or remain a prostitute. It rejected defendant's argument that the statute's omission of a stated intent requirement automatically meant that it provided for strict criminal liability. To read &sect; 201.300(1)(a) as imposing strict liability would shift the crime's focus from the panderer's efforts to recruit prostitutes to the success of the recruiting program. The statute did not criminalize a substantial amount of protected expressive authority and thus fell to the First Amendment overbreadth doctrine. The statute did not prohibit abstract advocacy of prostitution; it forbade efforts to recruit a targeted person to work as a prostitute. The statute gave adequate notice of the conduct it prohibited and did not give law enforcement such standardless discretion that it authorized or encouraged seriously discriminatory enforcement. The crime of pandering did not require that the defendant's persuasion succeed. The failure to give a specific intent instruction affected defendant's substantial rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Second Judicial District Court, Washoe County, Nevada, issued a writ of mandamus requiring appellant Washoe County Treasurer to refund excess taxes paid by respondent taxpayers for the 2006-2007 tax year. The taxpayers paid the excess taxes because of a stay imposed in a pending appeal challenging a prior year's assessments. The Treasurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Treasurer argued that writ of mandamus was inappropriate because Nevada's statutory tax collection scheme provided the taxpayers with an appropriate legal remedy for overpayment of taxes and because he had no legal duty to refund the excess amounts. The supreme court found that the taxpayers were not denied relief but instead prevailed before the County Board of Equalization and, ultimately, the State Board of Equalization. They were not required to pursue the remedies in Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 361.420 before seeking a refund under the procedural facts of the case. The State Board's failure to explicitly direct a refund did not abrogate the district court's power to enforce any other statutory duty to issue a refund. The remedies in Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 361.405(4) were not applicable because the State Board did not need to direct the Treasurer to take action as a result of its decision. Under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 360.2935, the Treasurer had a duty to refund the excess taxes paid during the supreme court's stay of the County Board's equalization decision.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court noted that the statute did not provide any plain method for major political party candidates' placement on the ballot. A major political party candidate was &quot;designated&quot; by the party central committee, not &quot;nominated.&quot; Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 304.240(1) was ambiguous, as it was unclear the extent to which Chapter 293 was intended to apply to special elections. The Legislature enacted Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 304.240 with the understanding that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 293.165 could be applied to a vacancy in office. Under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 304.240(1), the individual designated by the major political party's central committee, in compliance with Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 293.165, may be placed on the ballot when he or she was nominated for special election by filing a declaration pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 293.204.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of felony driving under the influence (DUI), under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 484C.110,  484C.400(1)(c). The Second Judicial District Court, Washoe County, Nevada, concluded he was ineligible for the alcohol treatment program because he had elected to go to trial rather than plead guilty or nolo contendere. The district court sentenced defendant to 30 months in prison and ordered him to pay a $2,000 fine. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a felony DUI case, the Supreme Court of Nevada considered whether it was unconstitutional to deny to defendants who exercised their right to a jury trial eligibility for the alcohol treatment diversion program set forth in Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 484C.340. The court held that the provisions of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 484C.340 were constitutional. Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 484C.340 was not an unconstitutional burden on the exercise of the right to a jury trial under U.S. Const. amend. VI. The statute did not violate defendant's right to equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because it was rationally related to the legitimate governmental purpose of extending a proper degree of leniency in return for a guilty plea, which conserved scarce prosecutorial resources.</SPAN></P>

The entity and appellant businesses appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The entity and business argued that because Assembly Bill (A.B.) 6, &sect; 18 applied in only a single Nevada county, and only to users of the municipal or county sewer systems in that county, it was a local law, and because it applied specifically and directly to a single entity in the state to the exclusion of all other similarly situated, it was a special law. The supreme court found that the bill addressed statewide concerns through legislation that applied only to the entity and funds collected from wastewater-treatment users within a certain locality. It was special (pertaining only to the entity) and local (applying only to a particular locality). A.B. 6, &sect; 18's mandate directing the entity to transfer money to the State's general fund for statewide-unrestricted-general use was an impermissible local and special tax, Nev. Const. art. 4, &sect; 20. Since A.B. 6, &sect; 18 was a local and special law that addressed a statewide concern to which a general law could have applied, it was not permissible under Nev. Const. art. 4, &sect; 21. The district court erred by declaring it constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This appeal involved an unmarried, childless couple who previously lived together and disputed the ownership of real property. Although Nev. Rev.

Therefore, the Supreme Court of Nevada held that the district court judge sitting in family court did not lack the power and authority to dispose of the case merely because it involved a subject matter outside the scope of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 3.223. The district court abused its discretion when it denied appellant girlfriend's motion to set aside the default without considering whether her boyfriend gave a proper notice of intent to take a default.</SPAN></P>

The nieces' refiled complaint was subject to preclusion principles. Because the nieces' position was supported by &sect; 11.340, it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to sanction the nieces for filing a frivolous claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with indecent exposure after &sect; 201.220 after he was alleged to have intentionally and repeatedly exposed his genitals and buttocks while standing on a public sidewalk in front of a county jail. A witness in a nearby car observed defendant's conduct and contacted the police. On appeal, the court affirmed. While the statute did not define what it meant to expose one's &quot;person&quot; in an &quot;open and indecent or obscene&quot; manner, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague as Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 193.050(3) incorporated common law definitions. Based on such definitions, indecent exposure included the intentional exposure of one's genitals on a public street corner. However, &sect; 201.220 could not be read so expansively as to permit conviction based on the exposure of one's buttocks alone. The court noted that the offense consisted of the intentional, open, and indecent or obscene exposure, not its visual observation by others.</SPAN></P>

The statutory language regarding eligibility under &sect; 4.010(2)(a) was not ambiguous regarding the meaning of the term &quot;years&quot;; the language at issue anticipated that the attorney would be licensed and admitted for an exact period of time equal to not less than five years and provided a specified date by which the five-year period had to conclude - before the attorney's election or appointment to the position. Section 4.010(2)(a) did not violate the attorney's equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and Nev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being censured by respondent, the Nevada Commission on Ethics, appellant city council member petitioned for judicial review before the First Judicial District Court, Carson City, Nevada. The district court issued an order denying the petition, and the city council member appealed, arguing that his censure for alleged violations of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 281A.420(1)(c) violated the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that voting by public officers on public issues was protected speech under the First Amendment. Because Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 281A.420(1)(c) directly involved the regulation of protected speech by a public officer in voting, it was subject to a strict scrutiny analysis. The court concluded that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 281A.420(8)(e) was unconstitutionally overbroad in violation of the First Amendment because it lacked necessary limitations to its regulations of protected speech. Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 281A.420(1)(c) required officials to refrain from voting on matters in which they would be affected by their commitments in a private capacity to the interests of others, but because subsection (8)(e) provided an overly broad definition of what constituted a commitment in a private capacity, the abstention requirement for this category of relationships lacked necessary limitations to its protected speech regulation. Thus, Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 281A.420(8)(e)'s application to a wide range of differing commitments and relationships was not narrowly tailored, was substantially overbroad, swept within its control a vast amount of protected speech, and violated the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;  281A.420(8)(e) to be unconstitutionally overbroad in violation of the First Amendment and reversed the district court's order.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court noted that the State failed to address defendant's argument that his constitutional right to confrontation was violated. This was a significant constitutional issue that compelled a response. Even after being notified of its failure to respond to the issue, the State failed to supplement its response and elected to wait until oral argument to address the constitutional issue or harmless error. Such appellate practice caused prejudice to defendant's ability to adequately prepare for or respond during oral argument. The supreme court invoked its authority under Nev. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The First Judicial District Court, Carson City, Nevada, granted respondents', individual members of the State Board of Equalization (State Board), motion to dismiss the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim against them by appellant taxpayers under Nev. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(5), finding that they were entitled to absolute immunity. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers challenged whether the individual members of the State Board were entitled to absolute immunity. The supreme court determined that the equalization process required the members to perform functions (fact-finding and making legal conclusions) similar to judicial officers, the process was adversarial, it applied procedural safeguards similar to a court, errors could be corrected on appeal, and the statutory scheme retained State Board members' independence from political influences. Because State Board members received evidence, rendered decisions, and regulated hearings, members of the State Board functioned like judicial officers. Nev. Rev. Stat. ch. 361's notice requirements were sufficient procedural safeguards to ensure that the public was afforded due process. A taxpayer's ability to appeal the State Board's decisions and findings provided the appropriate remedy to correct errors and was indicative of a quasi-judicial proceeding. The Legislature intended the equalization process to be open to the public and that the individual taxpayer be given notice of and the opportunity to participate in the State Board's valuation of his or her property.</SPAN></P>

As to the issue of legislative authority, the mandate in Nev. Rev.

The supreme court agreed that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 193.165(1) required the district court to make findings prior to imposing a sentence for a deadly weapon enhancement. Further, the plain language of the statute required the district court to make separate findings for each deadly weapon enhancement.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The stated purpose of the NCIAA was to protect families and children from the harmful effects of second hand smoke. On appeal, the supreme court considered whether the NCIAA was unconstitutionally vague for criminal enforcement. Concluding that it was, the supreme court next determined whether the district court properly severed the criminal provision from the statute. The supreme court considered the severance to be proper. The portion severed was not the central component of the statute and the remainder of the statute could stand alone. Nevertheless, the NCIAA passed a facial challenge for civil enforcement because this portion of the statute was not vague. The supreme court further concluded that the NCIAA did not constitute a governmental taking of private property. Business owners could still maintain possession and control over their property. The fact that they were subject to certain regulations did not result in the government taking complete control over their airspace or building property. In addition, the supreme court concluded that the NCIAA did not violate equal protection, as there were rational bases for the classifications made within the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was referred to Nevada's nonbinding arbitration program pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38.250(1). The arbitrator awarded a sum to the claimant. After a new trial, which was conducted as part of the short trial program, the jury awarded the same amount as the arbitration award. The court held that the requirement in Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38.259(2) that the arbitration award be admitted at a new trial did not deny the right to a jury trial under Nev. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3. The mandatory jury instruction set forth in &sect; 38.259(2)(b), which informed the jury that it was free to disregard the arbitration award and cautioned against giving the award undue weight, sufficiently addressed concerns regarding unconstitutional infringement on the jury's fact-finding role and ensured that a litigant's constitutional right to a jury trial was protected. Moreover, although there was a difference between the treatment of litigants with claims not exceeding the threshold amount in &sect; 38.250 and litigants with larger claims, this distinction was a rational legislative choice and did not violate the equal protection guarantees set forth in U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and Nev. Const. art. 4, &sect; 21.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This matter arose from an incident at the casino when casino security personnel and two Gaming Control Board (GCB) agents detained the detainee because he matched the description of a person in whom another GCB agent was interested. The relevant allegations in the complaint asserted that the detention was executed without reasonable suspicion. The instant court found that the district court properly refused to dismiss the &sect; 1983 claims on qualified immunity grounds. The instant court reasoned that the qualified immunity doctrine did not extend to protect private actors. Next, the instant court found that the evidentiary rulings in question were within the district court's considerable discretion and that the attorney misconduct in this case, while prevalent, did not override the jury's verdict, which was based on substantial evidence in the damages phase of the trial. Finally, the instant court found that the jury's $ 500,000 award was a result of continued attorney misconduct, including a &quot;golden rule&quot; violation and improper emotional arguments, such that a new trial was warranted as to punitive damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court affirmed the compensatory damages portion of the district court's judgment, reversed the punitive damages portion, and remanded for a new trial on punitive damages only.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada) of burglary while in possession of a deadly weapon, robbery with use of a deadly weapon, and one count of open and gross lewdness. The appellate court addressed three issues that defendant raised on appeal and their accompanying subissues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court did not err in its use of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 202.265(5)(b), and 202.253(2) in the jury instruction. Since &sect;&sect; 202.265(5)(b) and 202.253(2) defined firearm, and both definitions were included within Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 193.165(6)'s definitions of deadly weapon, for enhancement purposes, a firearm under &sect; 202.265(5)(b) was a deadly weapon. The district court did not err by instructing the jury that a firearm under &sect;&sect; 202.265(5)(b) and 202.253(2) was a deadly weapon regardless of whether it was unloaded or inoperable. However, the State failed to establish either that the a toy pellet gun could fire a projectile by the force of an explosion or combustion or that it was capable of firing a metal projectile. Defendant argued unsuccessfully that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 201.210 was unconstitutionally vague. The term open was not vague, as used in &sect; 201.210, gross sufficiently informed people what degree of lewdness was prohibited, and the terms lewd or lewdness had generally accepted meanings. The district court's jury instruction concerning his open and gross lewdness charges was adequate under plain error review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court was affirmed in part and reversed in part and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion. The aggravated sentence for burglary while in possession of a deadly weapon and the deadly weapon enhancement sentence for the robbery conviction were reversed. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Nevada Ethics Commission, instituted administrative proceedings against respondent state senator, asserting an ethical violation. The senator moved to dismiss the administrative proceeding on separation of powers grounds. When the motion was denied, the senator filed a petition for judicial review in the district court (Nevada), which held that the Commission was barred from proceeding against the senator. The Commission appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission alleged that the senator violated Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 281A.420 by failing to disclose an alleged conflict of interest regarding a senate bill and by failing to abstain from the voting on that bill. In his private capacity, the senator was president of the Associated Builders and Contractors of Southern Nevada, and the bill related to lease-purchase and installment-purchase agreements that would have affected his group's members. The court held that the Legislature's power to discipline its membership with respect to the core legislative function of voting and, by extension, disclosure of conflicts of interest, was a function constitutionally committed to each house of the Legislature under Nev. Const. art. 4, &sect; 6, and it could not be delegated to another branch of government. Because the Commission was charged with executing the laws, Nev. Const. art. 5, &sect; 7, it was part of the executive branch, and therefore the delegation to the Commission by the Legislature of the power to discipline its members with respect to such core legislative functions was an unconstitutional delegation of power in violation of the separation of powers provision, Nev. Const. art. 3, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

The victim was the eldest. She told investigators that she had been molested continually for about five years, beginning at age five, when she had to have stitches in her vagina because it was torn. At the time of the preliminary hearing, discovery was almost complete. Defendant's counsel gave a thorough and lengthy cross-examination, questioning all the various incidents, the victim's motives, whether any of the siblings had witnessed the abuse, and details regarding defendant's penis. Prior to trial, the victim died. The State sought to introduce her testimony from the preliminary hearing at trial. Defendant objected that it violated his right to confrontation under U.S. Const. amend. VI. The court held that the victim's testimony at the preliminary hearing was testimonial, and she was an unavailable witness. Therefore, her testimony was admissible if defendant had an opportunity for an effective cross-examination, including sufficient discovery. The court concluded that he did.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The primary issue was whether the constitutionality of Nevada's lethal injection protocol may be challenged in a post-conviction petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The inmate argued that Nevada's lethal injection protocol violated the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution because it did not sufficiently safeguard against a substantial risk of serious harm. The constitutionality of the lethal injection protocol clearly did not involve a challenge to the validity of the conviction. Since his challenge to the lethal injection protocol would not preclude his execution under current law using another protocol, his challenge to the lethal injection protocol did not implicate the validity of the death sentence and therefore fell outside the scope of a post-conviction petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The district court did not err in rejecting the inmate's claim without conducting an evidentiary hearing. The district court did not err by dismissing the inmate's claims that his guilty plea was not entered knowingly and voluntarily. The district court did not err in dismissing his claims that trial and appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offender, who had pleaded guilty to attempted lewdness with a minor, successfully served a sentence of probation. After maintaining a clean criminal record for approximately 15 years, the offender received a pardon from the State Board of Pardons Commissioners. His criminal record was sealed, pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 179.245. DPS argued that the record had been erroneously sealed because, as a convicted sex offender, sealing the record was expressly precluded by Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 179.245(5). The district court set aside the prior order that sealed a criminal record. The offender contended that his pardon not only cleared the civil rights restrictions attendant with his conviction, but further included the right to seal his criminal records. The court addressed the scope of the pardoning power, under Nev. Const. art. 5, &sect; 14. The court held that the pardoning power did not bequeath innocence or erase the historical fact of the underlying criminal act and conviction. Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 179.245(5) did not improperly impinge on the Pardons Board's power, and the district court did not abuse its discretion when it unsealed the criminal record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada) convicting him of robbery, intimidating a public officer, and battery with substantial bodily harm. Defendant was adjudicated a habitual criminal and was sentenced to two concurrent prison terms of 240 months with parole eligibility after 96 months to run concurrent with a 12-month jail term.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant struck the victim in the face, knocking him unconscious. While the victim was unconscious, defendant rifled through the victim's pockets and took his cellular phone. When he was apprehended, defendant became extremely irate and threatened multiple public officers with physical violence. For several weeks, the victim experienced dizziness and could not bend over without almost losing consciousness. He had headaches for a month and a half. Defendant contended that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 0.060(2)'s definition of substantial bodily harm as prolonged physical pain was unconstitutionally vague. The court concluded that the phrase &quot;prolonged physical pain,&quot; under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 0.060(2), had a well-settled and ordinarily understood meaning and, as a result, was not unconstitutionally vague. The phrase &quot;prolonged physical pain&quot; necessarily encompassed some physical suffering or injury that lasted longer than the pain immediately resulting from the wrongful act. The phrase was not so lacking in specific standards as to allow arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 484.37941, finding that the statute did not clearly indicate legislative intent to apply the statute retroactively. The district court granted a stay, and defendant petitioned for a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the plain language of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 484.37941 applied to offenders who entered guilty pleas on or after July 1, 2007, the statute's effective date. The State argued that &sect; 484.37941 violated the separation-of-powers doctrine by giving the district court the power to determine how to charge a DUI offender, a decision that was exclusively within the province of the executive branch of government represented by the prosecutor. The supreme court found that after the charging decision was made, any exercise of discretion permitted by the statute was simply a choice between the legislatively prescribed penalties set forth in the statute. The district court's decision to allow an offender to enter a program of treatment was analogous to the decision to sentence an offender to probation and therefore was a decision that properly fell within the discretion of the judiciary. Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 484.37941 did not limit the prosecutor's unfettered discretion to determine whether to charge an offender for a third-time DUI or for a lesser offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner contended that the district court erred by dismissing, without an evidentiary hearing, his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and that the district court's ruling mandated reversal of his conviction and death sentence.

Petitioner argued that the district court erroneously dismissed his claims that the premeditation instruction was improper and that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the instruction. His trial counsel had no basis upon which to challenge the instruction as it represented a correct statement of the law at the time of the trial. A new premeditation instruction, under Byford v. State, 116 Nev. 215 (2000), did not have retroactive application on collateral review. Petitioner's claims that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to instructions on malice, on the lesser-related instruction on grand larceny, and on mitigation were also properly summarily dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A law clerk in the attorney's office was admitted to practice law in Arizona but was not admitted to practice law in Nevada. Despite this, the law clerk worked in the attorney's Las Vegas office and represented personal injury plaintiffs, attempting to negotiate settlements before filing suit. When an insurance company adjuster inquired into the law clerk's status, he learned that the law clerk was not admitted to practice law in Nevada and filed a grievance. The law clerk was found to have engaged in the unauthorized practice of law, and the attorney was found to have assisted him in such practice. On review, the court concluded that the law clerk's conduct constituted the practice of law. The law clerk routinely conducted initial client consultations and decided whether representation should be accepted, negotiated clients' claims, made legal arguments in support of a client's position, and served as the clients' sole contact in the firm. All of these activities constituted the practice of law. Because the law clerk's conduct conformed with the policies of the attorney's firm, the attorney assisted in the unauthorized practice of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juveniles were over the age of 13 when they were charged, in separate cases, with offenses involving the use of a firearm.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 62B.390(3)(b). The court held that, by requiring the juveniles to admit to the charged criminal conduct in order to overcome the presumption of adult certification, under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 62B.390(2), (3), the juveniles' right against self-incrimination, under U.S. Const. amend. V, was violated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was defendant's ex-wife, and their three-year old daughter witnessed her mother's torture and killing. Defendant was sentenced to death, upon the jury's finding of three aggravating circumstances: defendant subjected the victim to nonconsensual sexual penetration, the murder was committed during a burglary, and the murder involved torture or mutilation. Appealing the denial of habeas corpus, defendant argued that the district court erred in using torture and burglary as aggravating circumstances to support the death sentence. The court agreed that the burglary aggravating circumstance should be stricken. Regarding the torture aggravating circumstance, the court held that the same conduct of torture could support a murder theory and an aggravated circumstance because Nevada's definition of torture murder sufficiently narrowed the class of persons eligible for the death penalty. Reweighing the aggravating and mitigating evidence, the court held that, absent the erroneous burglary aggravator, the jury still would have imposed death. Defendant's other post-conviction claims of ineffective assistance, including failure to challenge his competency, were all properly denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended a recent case, Nay v. State, 167 P.3d 430 (2007), required that his convictions be overturned. The supreme court disagreed, retreated from the absolute certainty approach advanced in Bolden v. State, 121 Nev. 908 (2005), and reaffirmed the harmless-error approach taken in Nay; harmless-error review applied when a general verdict could rest on a legally valid or a legally invalid alternative theory of liability. Here, although defendant was entitled to an instruction precluding the use of afterthought robbery as the predicate felony for felony murder, this instructional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as defendant twice confessed to the killing, led authorities to the victim's body, admitted he strangled the victim for over an hour before breaking her neck, and stabbed her in the back three times for the admitted purpose of flooding her lungs with blood. Based on this evidence alone, a rational jury would have found that the murder was willful, deliberate, and premeditated. Further, the district court correctly instructed the jury that the taking of the victim's property could occur as an afterthought to the use of force.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent and two codefendants murdered a cab driver during the course of a robbery. During the penalty phase of the trial, the jury found only one aggravating circumstance: the murder was committed during the course of a robbery. Defendant was sentenced to death. He filed a second post-conviction petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that pursuant to McConnell, the aggravating circumstance found by the jury was invalid because it was improperly based on the felony used to obtain the first-degree murder conviction. The district court concluded that the appropriate remedy for a McConnell error was a new penalty hearing, not a new trial. The Supreme Court of Nevada upheld the decision and rejected the State's contention that McConnell was wrongly decided. The State's exercise of discretion to charge respondent on alternative theories of murder did not constitute a trial error. The State's decision to base an aggravating circumstance on the robbery that was also the basis for the felony-murder theory resulted in a sentencing error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Washoe County Board of Equalization issued a general equalization decision for a certain tax year, rolling back the taxable valuations of approximately 8,700 properties. The supreme court decided to consider the request for extraordinary relief because the taxpayers would not have the opportunity to appeal, or petition the court for judicial review of the State Board's decision to remand. The petition required the supreme court to consider whether the State Board had jurisdiction to hear the appeal from the County Board's general equalization decision. The supreme court determined that the State Board retained jurisdiction to hear the appeal, even though the statutory deadline had expired because that deadline was directory, meaning that it was advisory rather than compulsory. The State Board had discretion to remand the matter to the County Board only when the record was inadequate. The minutes in this case were sufficient to enable the State Board's review, and the State Board arbitrarily remanded the matter. Writ relief was substantively warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a fatal accident, defendant's blood draw revealed traces of marijuana metabolite and a 0.14 blood alcohol concentration (BAC). At his trial for driving under the influence causing death, the district court permitted jurors to ask witnesses a number of questions but routinely resolved objections to those questions in unrecorded bench conferences held within the jury's presence. On an isolated occasion, the district court also asked four juror questions without first conducting one of these unrecorded hearings. The Supreme Court of Nevada held that the district court abused its discretion in failing to give the parties an opportunity to object at a bench conference; however, the procedural error was harmless, since none of the questions elicited testimony that prejudicially impacted the jury's verdict. Because a rational jury could have concluded that defendant was operating his vehicle under the influence with a BAC almost twice the legal limit when the rollover accident occurred, the evidence of his guilt was overwhelming.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeowner filed suit against defendant county in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada), claiming that his constitutional rights had been violated and alleging trespass to land and chattels, conversion, nuisance, and negligence, all arising out of a nuisance abatement by the county. The county's motions for summary judgment were granted, and the homeowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county had received complaints that the homeowner's property was cluttered with trailers, vehicles, a bus, junk, trash, debris, and a green pool. After several notices and extensions, county personnel abated the nuisance by removing the offending vehicles and debris. The court found that the county was immune from liability under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41.032(2), applying the Berkovitz-Gaubert two-part test. First, the actions of the county inspectors were discretionary because the abatement procedure required the inspectors to use their own judgment in assessing the conditions on the property to determine if abatement was required. The inspectors had to determine the nature of various items on the property, whether he was operating a salvage yard, and if the debris amounted to a dangerous condition in violation of the county code. Second, the county was motivated by environmental, health, and economic policies supported by the code and statutory authority. The homeowner's remaining constitutional claims, based on his assertion that the term &quot;inoperative automobiles&quot; was vague, failed to state a claim because property owners were not a protected class, among other reasons.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the district court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that Nev. Rev.

Const. art. XIX, &sect;&sect; 2(4) and 3(2), and thereby directly inhibiting the initiative process. Therefore, &sect; 295.056(3) was unconstitutional. The court's extraordinary intervention in this matter was warranted. The PAC had a constitutional right, under art. XIX, &sect;&sect; 2(4) and 3(2), to circulate its property tax reform initiative for signatures until June 17, 2008, because the statutory submission deadline of May 20, 2008, was unconstitutional. The PAC's reasonable attempt to comply with the earlier submission deadline, later determined invalid, could not be used to defeat its constitutional right to petition, especially when the invalidity of the statutory submission deadline was unclear. Because &sect; 295.056(3) impermissibly established a submission deadline earlier than what was otherwise permitted, i.e., May 20, 2008, that provision was unconstitutional, and the June 17, 2008, deadline under that provision's former version remained in effect.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that the district court did not err by refusing to allow defendant to apply for treatment pursuant to Nev. Rev.

Because &sect; 484.37941's provisions merely gave the district court discretion to allow a defendant to complete a treatment program in order to obtain a conviction and sentence for a lesser offense, the provisions were not of constitutional dimension and were not applicable retroactively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sent to a mental health facility for a competency determination. He was eventually found competent to stand trial, and he appealed after his conviction. In reversing, the supreme court held that the Eighth Judicial District Court in Nevada had the discretion to assign the determination of all competency matters to a department under Rules of Practice for the Eighth Judicial District Court 1.30(b)(5), 1.60(a), and 3.10(b). The determination of a defendant's ongoing competency during trial had to vest with the trial judge who had been assigned to hear the matter. Defendant's request for a continuance should have been granted after his return from the facility; defendant did not have the opportunity to confer with assigned counsel, and his assigned counsel was not at the hearing. Further, defendant's fair trial rights were violated when a competency hearing was not granted. While the request for a hearing under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 178.460 might have been untimely, a hearing was warranted because defense counsel had raised reasonable doubt as to defendant not having the sufficient present ability to consult with counsel at that time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Actions were filed in the First Judicial District Court, Carson City (Nevada), arising out of initiatives sought to be added to the ballot by appellant proponents which would affect respondent, a convention and visitors authority. The Secretary of State determined that the circulators' affidavits for the initiatives were defective. The proponents sought relief in the district court, which upheld the Secretary of State. The proponents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proponents' initiatives would have redirected financing received by the convention and visitors authority to other state agencies. While the parties' original actions were on appeal, the Secretary of State made the determination that the circulators' affidavits completely failed to include two statements mandated by Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 295.0575: first, they did not state the number of signatures on the document, and second, they did not state that each signer had an opportunity to read the full text of the initiative before signing. The court held that substantial compliance was all that was required, but that the affidavits did not substantially comply with the statute. The proponents' efforts in the district court to cure the affidavits' defects were insufficient because the proponents failed to make a valid offer of proof necessary to show whether the circulators nevertheless complied with the statute's purposes. The court rejected the proponents' First Amendment free political speech challenge to enforcement of the affidavit requirements based on approval of similar requirements in a prior U.S. Supreme Court case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's decision to disqualify all three initiatives. The court affirmed in part the district court's decision in the original actions allowing the convention and visitors authority to participate in the court actions challenging the initiative petitions. The court dismissed the remaining portions of the appeal as mooted by its disqualification of the initiatives.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated writ proceedings, the Secretary of State and the elector challenged the qualifications of eight candidates; the candidates, who had concededly held their positions since 1997, disputed whether the term-limit amendment applied to bar them from serving another term starting in 2009. The supreme court concluded that under Nev. Const. art. XV, &sect; 3(2), if a person had served, or at the conclusion of his or her current term would have served, 12 years or more in an office or a position on a local governing body, that person could not be reelected to that office or position. Without any demonstration that precedent concluding that a ballot question which enacted the term limit amendment met the constitutional &quot;same manner&quot; requirement was clearly erroneous, the supreme court could not disavow it. Thus, the supreme court held that term-limit amendment was validly enacted. As the candidates, at the conclusion of their current terms, would have served at least 12 years in their respective offices, they could not be elected to their current positions. Accordingly, mandamus relief was appropriate, and the candidates names were excluded from the upcoming general election ballot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To arrive at the taxable value for the subject land, the assessor relied on sales prices of properties in the surrounding area, adjusting the sales prices of those properties and the land's valuation based on the properties' comparable views, beachfront qualities, times of sale, and planned uses. The State and county contended that, even if unconstitutional methods were used to determine the properties' taxable values, the district court's orders granting the petitions for judicial review should be reversed because the taxpayers failed to prove that their properties' taxable values exceeded their full cash values. That position, however, disregarded a taxpayer's right to a uniform and equal rate of assessment and taxation, which was guaranteed by Nev. Const. art. X, &sect; 1. A property value determined using unconstitutional, nonuniform methods was necessarily unjust and inequitable. Thus, because the methods used to value a taxpayer's property were a material consideration in determining whether the property was justly and equitably valued, the taxpayers could challenge an assessment based on the use of unconstitutional methods even if the assessment did not exceed full cash value.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court concluded that, because condemnation deposits constituted private property to the extent that a party was entitled to the condemnation deposit, the condemnees were likewise entitled to the interest earned on that deposit. The placement of the interest into the local government's general fund for public benefit, that act constituted a taking under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Former Nev. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner district court judge filed an original petition for a writ of mandamus or prohibition and a request for declaratory relief, which challenged the constitutionality of Sen. Bill 195 (Nev. 2005), amending Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 3.018. The judge sought to prevent respondents, Nevada Secretary of State and a county registrar of voters, from holding the next election for four judicial positions created by Bill 195.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge, who held one of the positions created by Bill 195, argued that Bill 195 unconstitutionally created positions for judges with initial terms of two years, when the Nevada Constitution required six-year terms for all district court judges. She sought to have her two year term changed to a six-year term. Upon review, the court determined that Bill 195 did not violate the Nevada Constitution because the Nevada Constitution provided the Nevada Legislature with the ability to create new judicial positions for less than six-year initial terms in order to place judicial positions on the same election cycle. Statutes creating judicial positions with shortened initial terms to preserve a uniform general election cycle were constitutional. In addition, a judge selected for a shortened initial term had no right to later claim entitlement to a full six-year term. Finally, although the two-year term limitation was not enacted in Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 3.018 when it was amended to add judges to the Eight Judicial District, the limitation was enacted in the official Statutes of Nevada.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers effected a routine traffic stop on an automobile driven by defendant. Defendant was placed under arrest because of outstanding warrants. Drugs were found in a fanny pack and inside a sunglass case that was under the vehicle's floormat. On appeal, defendant contended, inter alia, that: the State used its peremptory challenges improperly, the State improperly commented on defendant's post-Miranda silence, and the State improperly introduced character evidence, which was prohibited by Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48.045(2). The supreme court concluded that the State violated Batson because, with respect to two of the jurors, the State's challenges were false and pretextual. Further, the State's witnesses improperly commented on defendant's post-Miranda silence at trial, and the supreme court could not say that the comments were harmless. Moreover, an officer's comments that methamphetamine users supported their habits by committing robberies affected defendant's substantial rights. The supreme court found, however, that the search of the vehicle was lawful. The supreme court also determined that evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction, but the errors required reversal.</SPAN></P>

The Second Judicial District Court, Washoe County (Nevada), dismissed the complaint because the homeowners had not submitted the claims to mediation under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38.319 (2007). The homeowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38.310 (2007), a district court had to dismiss disputes arising from the interpretation, application, or enforcement of homeowners' associations' covenants, conditions, and restrictions if the parties did not first submit the dispute to mediation or arbitration. This requirement did not apply to actions for injunctive relief involving an immediate threat of irreparable harm, or actions relating to the title to residential property. On an issue of first impression, the filing of a lien, in and of itself, did not create an immediate threat of irreparable harm. An action to release a lien, without more, did not relate to the title to residential property. As neither of these exceptions was shown, the homeowners were required to submit their claims to mediation or arbitration before instituting their action. Moreover, &sect; 38.310 applied to a collection agency that acted as the association's agent. Since the homeowners had not first submitted their claims against the homeowners' association and the collection agency to mediation or arbitration as required by &sect; 38.310, the district court properly dismissed their complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time petitioner and real party in interest were divorced, real party in interest was a district court judge, but real party in interest failed to get reelected. Subsequently, real party in interest again ran for a district court judgeship. The instant court concluded that by failing to comply with Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 125.110 when it sealed the entire case file, the district court manifestly abused its discretion. Section 125.110(2) allowed the district court to seal only certain documents in a divorce proceeding and only upon a party's written request. Even if the district court retained inherent authority to seal the record in divorce cases, real party in interest failed to demonstrate that the order sealing the entire case file was a necessary exercise of that power to protect his or any other person's rights or to otherwise administer justice. The gag order was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The district court failed to consider whether potential publicity posed a serious and imminent threat to a protected competing interest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada, affirmed the decision of respondent Transportation Services Authority of Nevada (TSA) levying fines against appellant company for alleged violations of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706.386, which proscribed fully regulated common motor carriers from operating as carriers of intrastate commerce without first obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued that it was not within Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706.386's reach because the company never held itself out to the public as willing to transport property by vehicle. The supreme court disagreed. The record supported the TSA's determination that the company's course of business illustrated its true identity as a fully regulated common motor carrier. The company held itself out to the public as a referral service for individual movers by placing telephone directory advertisements. The company referred its customers to individual loader/packers only after those customers rented a moving vehicle from another company, which was owned by the same persons. The company's scheme was designed to accomplish conduct plainly regulated by the TSA: intrastate operations carried out by public moving services. Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706.137 was not constitutionally vague as it neither forbade nor required any action, and the TSA was not authorized to regulate anyone who merely engaged in the transportation of household goods. It was narrowly tailored to protect the public from unlicensed, uninsured, and unregistered common motor carriers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Nevada Attorney General filed a complaint under Nev. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case arose from the Tax Commission's decision, following a series of hearings that it closed to the public, to grant the taxpayer a refund of use taxes it paid from 1998 to 2000. Thereafter, believing that the Tax Commission violated the Open Meeting Law by deliberating and voting on the taxpayer's appeal in closed sessions, the Attorney General filed a complaint to void the refunds. The court ruled that the Tax Commission violated the Open Meeting Law to the extent that it received nonconfidential evidence, deliberated, and voted on the taxpayer's tax appeal in closed sessions. Former Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 360.247 created a limited exception to the Open Meeting Law, under which the Tax Commission could close, at a taxpayer's request, only the portion of the Tax Commission's session at which it received confidential evidence, and questioned witnesses, and heard argument concerning confidential information. The exception did not permit the Tax Commission to hold all portions of the taxpayer appeal hearings in closed sessions. Under the Open Meeting Law, the Tax Commission was required to receive nonconfidential evidence, deliberate, and vote in open session.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant water right owner sued respondents, a city and the State Engineer, challenging a decision that pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 533.085(1), the cancellation of the city's permit did not result in a loss of priority for the water rights that it had purchased. The First Judicial District Court, Carson City (Nevada) denied the owner's petition. The owner appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue was whether the city had lost priority in certain vested water rights after the State Engineer canceled and later reinstated a permit modifying the use of those rights pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 533.395. Two unambiguous statutes were in conflict: Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 533.085(1) and 533.395(3). The argument that vested water rights could be lost by applying for and receiving a permit modifying the use of those rights failed as nothing in Nev. Rev. Stat. ch. 533 or prior case law suggested that an application to modify vested rights amounted to intentional abandonment of those rights. Thus, the cancellation and later reinstatement of the city's permit did not affect its underlying vested rights. Although it lost the right to use the water in the approved manner when the permit was cancelled, it did not lose the priority attached to its vested rights because such a result would have impaired the city's vested rights in violation of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 533.085(1). The city's decision to apply for a permit did not subject its water rights to Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 533.395(3) because although it changed the use, its vested rights remained of the same character.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hotel, which was a hotel and casino resort, operated a number of restaurants. The hotel purchased a large quantity of unprepared food, upon which the hotel paid no sales or use tax. The hotel then served the food in one of two ways: as purchases through its restaurants or as complimentary meals. The hotel paid use tax on the food it used to prepare complimentary meals. In its refund claim, the hotel argued that the food it purchased and used for complimentary meals was not subject to either sales or use tax. The application of use tax was the primary issue on appeal. The supreme court agreed with the hotel because the taxes collected in this case were unconstitutional, pursuant to Nev. Const. art. 10, &sect; 3(A). The use of its tax-exempt food to prepare and distribute complimentary patron and employee meals did not constitute a taxable event under Nevada's food exemption. The constitutionally mandated exemption applied to all &quot;food for human consumption,&quot; unless that food was prepared food intended for immediate consumption. The hotel was entitled to a refund of the use taxes paid on the meals, and the district court erred in granting the Tax Department summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction in light of the video surveillance tapes, the testimony of the convenience store employee and a police officer, and the victim's grand jury testimony, showing that when the police arrived at the convenience store, defendant grabbed the victim. However, the court held that the district court lacked jurisdiction to sentence defendant as a habitual criminal under Nev. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of a divorce, the husband was required to pay child support. He filed a motion to reduce such after losing a judicial campaign. A judgment of arrears was entered, and the husband sought to have the case file sealed due to the fact that he was running for office again. The request was granted, and the district court also sua sponte issued a gag order preventing the parties and their attorneys from discussing the case. This writ petition followed. In granting mandamus relief, the supreme court determined that, by failing to comply with Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 125.110 when it sealed the entire case file, the district court manifestly abused its discretion. The district court also manifestly abused its discretion when it, sua sponte, issued a gag order prohibiting all communication relating to the case, without providing reasonable notice that it was considering such a restrictive order. Gag orders could have been issued only when: (1) the activity posed a clear and present danger or a serious and imminent threat to a protected competing interest, (2) the order was narrowly drawn, and (3) no less restrictive means were available.</SPAN></P>

Three of the four production convictions were reversed, and the case was remanded for rensentencing. The district court increased the minimum sentence and ordered that the sentences run consecutively. This appeal followed. In vacating, the supreme court noted that the Dolby case held that the vacation of a lawful sentence on one count did not permit a district court to increase a lawful sentence imposed on a separate count. Dolby embodied the double jeopardy policy followed in Nevada, and the federal courts' approach to this issue was rejected. The supreme court extended Dolby to apply to resentencings mandated on appeal. Finally, the district court's resentencing on the lawful portions of defendant's conviction surviving direct appeal violated his rights against double jeopardy under Nev.

The Ninth Judicial District Court, Douglas County (Nevada) denied relief, holding that the agreement unduly burdened interstate commerce in violation of the dormant Commerce Clause. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court found that non-putrescible construction debris was not injurious to the public health and therefore fell outside of the county's police power. The supreme court disagreed, noting that such construction waste could contain materials adverse to human health and posed other safety hazards. Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 444.510(1) required local governments to develop a plan to provide for a solid waste management system, and Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 244.187(3) and 244.188(1)(b) authorized counties to grant exclusive franchises for the collection and disposal of garbage and &quot;other waste,&quot; including construction waste. The district court erred when it found that the exclusive franchise agreement violated the dormant Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, because: (1) the county had a legitimate if not compelling health and safety interest in regulating construction waste through an exclusive franchise; (2) no unequal burden on interstate commerce had been created, as the disposal company's rivals were no more affected by the agreement than any other intrastate or interstate firms; and (3) the rivals did not argue that an available, less burdensome alternative existed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the district court's order denying the injunction and remanded the matter to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada, convicted defendant of conspiracy to commit robbery, robbery with the use of a deadly weapon, and failure to stop on the signal of a police officer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the conviction for &quot;failure to stop&quot; under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 484.348(3)(b) was unconstitutionally unfair. The supreme court noted that the term &quot;endangers,&quot; as used in the statute, was not unconstitutionally vague when considered in the context of the entire statute. The statute gave fair notice to people of ordinary intelligence that an individual was committing a felony when they drove in such a manner as to endanger persons or property while fleeing from a police vehicle with its lights and sirens activated. The district court did not err by failing to sua sponte excuse the veniremember for cause where she would not be biased. The limited use of the leg bracelets on defendant during the first day of jury selection was harmless error as there was no evidence that any juror actually saw defendant wearing them. Defendant was not entitled to eight peremptory challenges as none of the offenses charged carried the possibility of a life sentence. Defendant's proposed jury instructions were properly rejected as they were duplicative and misstated Nevada law. Defendant's habitual criminal sentence was authorized by statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case pending before the supreme court raised several issues of first impression concerning a rarely used but formidable power available to the Nevada Commission on Judicial Discipline to temporarily suspend a judge before conducting a formal hearing. The Commission did not abuse its discretion in determining that the totality of the circumstances justified the interim suspension of the judge based on her: (1) inability to adequately conduct criminal trials; (2) abusive behavior toward court personnel, including sexual harassment and creating a hostile work environment; (3) falling asleep on the bench; and (4) failure to cooperate with colleagues and court administration. As the Commission's procedures accorded the judge due process, the court rejected her challenges to the suspension on this basis. Because the Commission entered its suspension order before any formal statement of charges was filed, its hearing on the suspension was closed. The denial of the judge's request to subpoena documents concerning other judicial disciplinary proceedings was not a violation of due process. Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1.467(3) was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, heirs and an administratrix of a decedent's estate, filed wrongful death claims for medical malpractice against defendant physician. The Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada, converted the action to a declaratory judgment action. The district court held that the physician was not a state employee entitled to sovereign immunity. The physician appealed. Amicus curiae challenged Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41.035(1)'s damages cap.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The practice of medicine as a governmental function did not fall outside the scope of Nev. Rev. Stat. ch. 41's provisions. Because he was a paid employee of a state agency, the physician was a state employee when he treated the deceased. In deciding whether the physician's acts were discretionary, the court adopted and applied the Berkovitz-Gaubert approach articulated by the U.S. Supreme Court for determining the scope of discretionary-act immunity. As the physician did not engage in policy-making decisions in his treatment of the deceased, he was not entitled to immunity from suit under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41.032(2). While the physician was not entitled to discretionary-function immunity, his status as a state employee entitled him to the statutory cap on tort damages set forth in Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41.035(1). The court rejected the argument that the damages cap violated constitutional equal protection and due process principles. Rational bases existed for treating public and private physicians differently, namely; the state treasury remained a legitimate state interest, and the state's interest in encouraging qualified professionals to accept state employment was legitimate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Nev. Rev.

The Legislature did not define the term &quot;fugitive from justice.&quot; Congress defined the term &quot;fugitive from justice&quot; in 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;&nbsp;921(a)(15). The Legislature failed to provide the public with statutory notice what the term meant. Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;202.360(1)(b) caused ordinary citizens to have to guess at its meaning and failed to give notice of the law so they could conform their conduct to its requirements. The statute was susceptible to arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement because it did not specify the circumstances under which a person could be arrested and prosecuted as a fugitive from justice in possession of a firearm. It established no clear standards to guide law enforcement officials, and, ultimately, jurors as to whether a violation had occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner district judge sought a writ of quo warranto under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 35.010(1) challenging respondent chief judge's authority to appoint a three-judge committee to work with the district judge in improving her judicial performance, reassigning the district judge's criminal caseload to another judge, and barring the district judge from the courthouse until she agreed to meet with the committee to address security concerns.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After receiving information that the district judge was behavior inappropriately with jurors and staff members, the chief judge appointed a three-judge committee to review the complaints. After the district judge failed to cooperate with the committee and obtained her own bodyguards to accompany her to the courthouse, the chief judge reassigned her criminal caseload and barred her from the courthouse. On the district judge's petition for a writ of quo warranto, the court held that while the chief judge properly appointed the three-judge committee under Nev. 8th J. Dist. Ct. R. 1.30(b)(16) to address issues related to the district judge's conduct on and off the bench, the chief judge did not have the authority to require the district judge to meet with the committee or to ban her for failing to do so. The proper remedy, absent an emergency situation, would be either with the court or the judicial discipline commission. Because the chief judge had valid reasons of convenience or necessity for reassigning the district judge's criminal cases to another judge, quo warranto did not lie to prevent the chief judge from doing so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver struck the pedestrian in a crosswalk while operating a vehicle owned by his mother and stepfather. The driver was 19, but he lived with his mother and stepfather. Thereafter, the pedestrian filed an action against the driver, the mother, and the stepfather under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41.440. Judgment was entered for the pedestrian, and this appeal followed. In partially affirming, the supreme court determined that a challenge to &sect; 41.440 under U.S. Const. amend. XIV based on due process and equal protection was meritless. A heightened level of scrutiny did not apply because no fundamental rights were implicated; moreover, there was no discrimination against a suspect class. Even though there was no legislative history to examine, the supreme court found that there were at least two rational bases for the enactment of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41.440. As such, the statute was constitutional. Next, liability was properly imposed upon the mother because of the family relationship. There was no distinction in the statute between dependent and adult children. However, it was error to find that the stepfather was an immediate family member as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the decision finding that the stepfather was an immediate family member of the driver was reversed, and the case was remanded for a new trial on that issue.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada), found defendant guilty of, inter alia, two counts of first-degree murder with the use of a deadly weapon. After a penalty hearing, the jury returned two verdicts of death for the murders. However, the supreme court remanded the case for a new penalty hearing. After new deliberations, the jury again returned two verdicts of death. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant gave a statement in allocution, in which he expressed remorse and asked for forgiveness for stealing two precious lives. The jury found seven mitigating factors, in that he had: (1) accepted responsibility for the crimes; (2) cooperated with the investigation; (3) demonstrated remorse; (4) counseled others against criminal acts; (5) suffered learning and emotional disabilities; (6) found religion; and (7) been denied by his father. But, the jurors determined that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors and returned two verdicts of death. Although defendant's childhood and upbringing were certainly not the best, and he apparently had made some effort to counsel others against taking his path, the facts of the case were compelling: (1) he robbed his former employer at gunpoint; (2) left the actual robbery to seek out two potential witnesses, the victims; and (3) stabbed the victims to death. The victims were young men who should have been safe at their place of work. Also, defendant had a violent criminal history and had shown a capacity for continued violence while in prison. Thus, the supreme court concluded that the death sentences were not excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was incarcerated during the summer of 2002. While he was there, he placed random telephone calls to several women and children in southern California. Each call began with a recording, which explained that the call was a collect call from the prison. The recipient of the call was then invited to accept or decline the call. Each victim accepted. Once defendant heard the victim accept the call, he informed her that the recording was a joke and then initiated a friendly conversation. Soon after, defendant told the victim that he was near her location, with a weapon, and that he would harm her if she did not participate in a sexual conversation with him. Defendant was subsequently convicted of 19 counts of felony coercion. He received a life sentence on each of the 19 counts. On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury to apply the reasonable person test. Therefore, the jury instructions were erroneous. Because the court did not know what the jury would have found in terms of the reasonable person test, it was not clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found defendant guilty of felony coercion absent the error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers owned real property near Lake Tahoe. After receiving dramatically increased tax bills, the taxpayers questioned the methods utilized by the assessor to value their real property. The taxpayers filed individual petitions for review with the county board of equalization in which they asserted that the assessor used unauthorized methodologies to value the land. The county upheld the assessments and the taxpayers appealed to the Nevada State Board of Equalization (State Board). The State Board held that the assessor's methodologies for appraising the properties was appropriate. The supreme court found that the methodologies used were invalid. Specifically, their inconsistent application violated the uniform and equal rate of assessment required by Nev. Const. art. 10. The 2003-2004 valuations, which were based on those methodologies, were therefore unjust and inequitable. Any taxes collected that could be attributed to those invalid methodologies were unconstitutional, as determined by the district court, and the taxpayers who paid such taxes were entitled to a refund.</SPAN></P>

Thus, consistent with Dusky, under Nevada statutory law, a defendant was incompetent to stand trial if he either was not of sufficient mentality to be able to understand the nature of the criminal charges against him or he was not able to aid and assist his counsel in the defense interposed upon the trial or against the pronouncement of the judgment thereafter. In addition, while a witness's testimony might have been relevant, the district court refused to allow her to testify until she turned over her notes of her meetings with defendant to the State.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although predicated upon existing legal principles, McConnell v. State set forth a new rule of death penalty law in Nevada. Under the McConnell case, it was impermissible under the United States and Nevada Constitutions to base an aggravating circumstance in a capital prosecution on the felony upon which a felony murder was predicated. Absent retroactive application of the rule in the McConnell case, there would be a significant risk that a defendant faced a punishment that the law could not impose. Thus, the supreme court concluded that the McConnell case announced a substantive rule of law that had to be applied retroactively. Having concluded that the McConnell case set forth a new substantive rule that demanded retroactive application, the supreme court applied it to the inmate's case. Thus, the robbery and receiving-money aggravating factors were removed from consideration. However, four valid aggravating factors supporting the inmate's death sentence remained. It was clear beyond a reasonable doubt that absent the invalid aggravating factors, the jury would have still sentenced the inmate to death. Therefore, the inmate was not entitled to any post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner city filed a petition for a writ of certiorari against respondents, the Eighth Judicial District Court (Nevada) and others, seeking a determination that the municipal court lacked jurisdiction to consider the constitutionality of Las Vegas, Nevada, Municipal Code 6.35.100(I) and that the district court improperly concluded that the municipal code provision was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Municipal courts had jurisdiction to consider the constitutionality of misdemeanor ordinances that a city sought to enforce as they had original jurisdiction over ordinance-based misdemeanors committed in their respective cities pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 5.050(2). It was illogical to conclude that only district courts had jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of misdemeanor ordinances when municipal courts had original jurisdiction to try cases under misdemeanor ordinances in the first instance. Las Vegas, Nevada, Municipal Code 6.35.100(I) was not unconstitutionally vague because when viewed in the context of other ordinances regulating erotic dance establishments, it required an intent to sexually arouse or excite. That construction adequately put dancers and patrons on notice as to what conduct was prohibited, permitted touching that was not intended to sexually arouse or excite, and provided an adequate standard for law enforcement. The ordinance was not unconstitutionally overbroad because even if fondling and caressing were protected expressive conduct when part of an erotic dance, the ordinance was a legitimate time, place, and manner restriction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's petition was granted with respect to the constitutional issues. The court clerk was directed to issue a writ of certiorari instructing the district court to reverse that portion of its order affirming the municipal court's determination that the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada, granted the writ petition and dismissed the charges that related to the out-of-state witnesses' affidavits. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 171.197. Defendant contended that this practice violated defendant's Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause right. At issue on appeal was whether the Confrontation Clause and jurisprudence from the United States Supreme Court applied at a preliminary examination. The supreme court concluded that the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause and Crawford decision did not apply to a preliminary examination because the confrontation right was historically described as a trial right. The supreme court further concluded that the statutory right to cross-examination, under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 171.196(5), was a qualified right, subject to the exception under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 171.197, which allowed the State to use an affidavit when a witness either resided outside of Nevada or more than 100 miles from the preliminary examination's location.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant corresponded through the Internet with an undercover police officer. When he arrived at a prearranged place with the alleged intent of having sex with a minor, he was arrested and charged with using technology to lure children. The indictment was later dismissed, and the State sought review. In affirming, the supreme court determined that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 201.560 was not vague, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The proscribed conduct was clearly defined and persons of ordinary intelligence had fair notice of what conduct was permitted. Further, it was not overbroad since the inducement of minors to engage in illegal sexual activity enjoyed no First Amendment protection. Also, &sect; 201.560 did not violate the Commerce Clause because, even though the electronic messages might have briefly been transmitted to places outside of Nevada, criminalizing such transgressions could have hardly been considered a burden on interstate commerce. The evidence did not support defendant's contention that he was entrapped. However, because the actual intended victim was not less than 16 years of age, the prosecution could not have established that element of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The opponents were business entities, such as bars, taverns, and convenience and grocery stores with gaming areas, where smoking was permitted, and their related organizations. If the initiative was passed, these entities would be compelled to further restrict smoking and in some instances prohibit it entirely. The instant court concluded that preelection challenges to the measure's substantive constitutionality were not ripe for judicial review. The instant court also concluded that the initiative's title clearly stated that the measure's purpose was to prohibit smoking in most public places, with the exception of casinos and &quot;stand-alone bars.&quot; However, in order to clarify the initiative's coverage with respect to bars, the instant court directed respondent Nevada Secretary of State to clearly indicate that the measure covered all bars with food-handling licenses. The initiative did not violate Nev. Const. art. XIX, &sect; 6's appropriation or expenditure provision because the expense inherent in the general enforcement of criminal statutes did not constitute an expenditure. Thus, the initiative's lack of a funding mechanism did not render it invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's order denying injunctive and declaratory relief was affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court found that the initiative encompassed only a single subject and was therefore not disqualified from appearing on the ballot. Section 295.009 placed a single-subject requirement on initiative petitions. The issue for the Supreme Court of Nevada was whether the initiative petition violated that requirement. The supreme court concluded that &sect; 295.009 was constitutional and that because the Nevada Property Owners' Bill of Rights embraced more than one subject, the initiative violated the statute. Even so, strong public policy favored upholding the initiative power whenever possible, and &sect; 295.009 did not prescribe a remedy for single-subject requirement violations. Because the initiative included a severability clause and facially and unequivocally pertained to a primary subject, eminent domain, the supreme court was compelled to sever sections 1 and 8, which did not pertain to eminent domain, in lieu of removing the entire initiative from the ballot. Further, the supreme court confirmed that initiatives proposing constitutional amendments had to propose policy and not direct administrative details.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The initiative petition that was circulated for signatures differed from the petition that the committee had filed with the Secretary of State. The instant court concluded that the district court erred in denying the opponents request for declaratory and injunctive relief because the initiative petition did not strictly adhere to the requirements of Nev. Const. art. XIX, &sect; 2(4). The record demonstrated that the difference between the filed version and the circulated version was material and substantial. The circulated version allowed a 21 percent increase in state spending during the initial budget cycle, while the filed version allowed only a 7.4 percent increase in spending. The primary purpose of the measure would not be effectuated under the circulated version. The circulated petition was not an accurate reflection of the committee's intent to implement a constitutional limit on government spending and was therefore misleading. Because the committee did not strictly adhere to the requirements of Nev. Const. art. XIX, &sect; 2(4) by filing a true copy of the initiative petition with the Secretary of State, the initiative necessarily failed.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. Defendant had an adequate opportunity to cross-examine the child. The fact that she answered negatively or &quot;I don't know&quot; when asked on cross-examination to identify to whom she spoke regarding the incident did not render the cross-examination ineffective. If anything, such testimony served to undermine her testimony and that of the surrogate witnesses. The child's availability for cross-examination at trial defeated defendant's &quot;as-applied&quot; challenge to &sect; 51.385. In addition, the child's statements to her father were nontestimonial in nature. A parent questioning his or her child regarding possible sexual abuse was inquiring into the health, safety, and well-being of the child. To characterize such parental questioning as the gathering of evidence for purposes of litigation would unnecessarily and undesirably militate against a parent's ability to support and nurture a child at a time when the child most needed that support.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of one count of second-degree murder with the use of a deadly weapon and one count of burglary while in possession of a deadly weapon. Defendant was 15 years old at the time of the offenses. On appeal, the court found that because defendant was properly detained and consented to being interviewed, his argument that the traffic citation statute,&nbsp;Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 62C.070, precluded his detention was without merit. An officer had reasonable grounds to suspect that he was the individual described in a police report and therefore had lawful grounds to detain him. Because his right to parental notification did not bear on the authority of the investigators to interview him, Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 62C.010 did not operate as a procedural bar to the admissibility of an otherwise voluntary statement. Further, because defendant was lawfully detained, and the officers' observation of blood on his stocking cap and sweatshirt was inadvertent and immediately apparent to be evidence of a crime, the admission of the stocking cap and sweatshirt did not violate his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The inmate was not entitled to relief on his claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the testimony of the victim's aunt, who was talking to the victim's grandmother at the time of the attack and placed the inmate at the murder scene, because the inmate failed to show that he was prejudiced, as he admitted to being at the house and killing the victim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Clark County operated the primary commercial airport serving southern Nevada.

At issue before the supreme court was whether the county's prostitution loitering ordinance was unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The supreme court agreed that the ordinance was vague and overly broad. Because CCO 12.08.030 lacked any guiding circumstances, the ordinance had an even broader sweep than similar stricken ordinances, thus heightening its unconstitutionality. Further, the conduct the ordinance criminalized was constitutionally protected. Because CCO 12.08.030 chilled this conduct, the ordinance was substantially overbroad in relation to its legitimate sweep. Also, the ordinance's provision for an opportunity to explain one's conduct did not mitigate this chilling effect. Second, the ordinance contained no specific intent element; therefore, it could not make constitutionally protected conduct criminal. The supreme court concluded that the county's prostitution loitering ordinance, 12.08.030, was both unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Therefore, the ordinance was void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant political action committee challenged a decision of the Ninth Judicial District Court, Douglas County, Nevada, which found that a sustainable growth initiative (SGI) conflicted with the county's master plan and was void ab initio in an action filed by respondents, the county, businesses, and individuals seeking injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The SGI limited building to 280 units per annum. The court held that to have legal effect, the SGI must be enacted as a zoning ordinance and thus was subject to substantial compliance with the master plan under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 278.250. The court also held that because the SGI clearly mirrored the policies and concerns of the master plan, it was substantially compliant with the master plan policies and goals. The master plan suggested a growth rate between 2 and 3.5 % annually, and the building cap in the SGI reflected approximately a 2 % increase, which was consistent with the plan. The fact that the county secured its bonds based on a 3.5 % annual growth rate, without any indication that the actual growth rate that would be implemented in the county would be 3.5 % did not render the SGI inconsistent. Further, the SGI did not preclude the county from implementing its incentive program to encourage developers to provide affordable housing, and by its plain language, Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 278.0201(3) did not prohibit the SGI. Because the building cap was based on a 2 % growth rate, the 280-unit cap was not arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners, in their requested for extraordinary relief, asserted that the district courts wrongfully applied the good cause standard by which the Attorney General could move to dismiss false claims actions. Similarly, in the second case, the Attorney General articulated a legitimate government purpose for dismissing the actions. The supreme court concluded that the Attorney General's assertion that these FCA actions implicated issues that were better left to the tax department's expertise constituted a basis for good cause dismissal; however, the supreme court did not preclude the possibility that some tax matters could be brought under the FCA. In the instant cases, though, no party demonstrated that the Attorney General acted improperly in moving to dismiss the underlying actions; therefore, the district courts manifestly abused their discretion when they refused to dismiss the underlying tax-based false claims actions for good cause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During jury selection, the district court dismissed the first venire because it did not reflect the racial makeup of the county.

The district court dismissed the second venire because the State was concerned over the randomness of the venire's selection since three of the first 12 jurors were African Americans. Neither defendant nor the State objected to the composition of the third venire. The supreme court concluded that the district court erred when it dismissed the second venire because no evidence in the record established that the second venire was not randomly selected and because the State's objection revealed a racial motive for dismissing the venire. The district court's order for a third venire was insufficient to cure the State's racial bias present in the dismissal of the second venire; thus, a new trial was required. Also, the supreme court concluded that the district court abused its discretion in allowing the State to impeach defendant with his conviction when he was a juvenile and the admission of that evidence was not harmless error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case involved Nev. Rev.

Stat. &sect; 50.315(4) was not unconstitutional because it adequately preserved the rights of an accused under the Confrontation Clause. The affidavit was a form and encompassed standard procedures used to withdraw blood for testing. It was developed and approved by the Committee on Testing for Intoxication. It was admissible and the municipal court and district court erred in excluding it on the basis of statutory noncompliance. Although it was admissible under state statute, it was still subject to challenge under the Sixth Amendment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot two victims to death and shot, but failed to kill, a third victim. The jury found defendant guilty of two counts of first-degree murder with the use of a deadly weapon and returned a sentence of death. The jury also found him guilty of attempted murder with the use of a deadly weapon, and he was sentenced to two consecutive terms of 96 to 240 months in prison. On appeal, the supreme court affirmed, rejecting defendant's argument that the State's cross-examination of a doctor concerning defendant's prior violent acts without the benefits of a Petrocelli hearing was reversible error. The supreme court stated that those requirements did not apply because the challenged evidence was not admitted pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48.045(2). Further, although the district court should have advised the jury of the consequences of a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, defendant was not prejudiced by that omission since the evidence against a finding of insanity was overwhelming. Defendant's rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments were not violated because he exercised a peremptory challenge to remove the veniremember in question.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court agreed. Defendant told the police that the child would come up to him and touch defendant's penis through his boxer shorts, but defendant recanted that statement at trial, and the child did not testify that defendant made him touch his penis. Further, none of the witnesses testified that the child said that defendant made him touch defendant's penis. During the police interview, the police asked the child whether he performed that act, but the transcripts indicated that the child's responses were not audible and it was impossible to tell what those responses were. Accordingly, there was no evidence, outside of the police interview statement, that that act occurred. Thus, that conviction violated the corpus delicti rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sent letters and left voicemail messages claiming to be the victim's illegitimate half-brother. He stated that he was entitled to half of the money the victim inherited from their father and that if the victim did not give him money, defendant would reveal crimes committed by the victim or his father to the authorities and the media. When his demands were ignored, he threatened to kill or injure the victim. The court held that, as used in &sect; 205.320, &quot;libel&quot; was the publication of a false statement of fact, &quot;disgrace&quot; meant to humiliate or cause loss of favor or standing, and &quot;secret&quot; meant a fact unfavorable one's interest and unknown to the public that one would wish to conceal. As the jury had not been instructed on these elements and returned a general verdict, it could have considered a legally insufficient theory of extortion; it might have found that defendant committed libel by making a true claim of common heritage. Other crimes evidence, which was relevant to prove that defendant was guilty of extortion, was improperly admitted because it was remote in time and prejudicial; however, the error was harmless as to the stalking and witness tampering convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions for aggravated stalking and preventing or dissuading a witness from testifying were affirmed, but his extortion convictions were reversed and the matter was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

He was convicted as charged and the court affirmed. While joinder of all charges in three groups was justified because the offenses in each group shared a scheme or plan common to that group, no overarching scheme or plan common to the three groups was demonstrated. Thus, the court was unable to sustain the joinder under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;173.115(2) on the ground. However, the three groups of acts were nevertheless connected together for purposes of the statute because evidence of each group would have been relevant and admissible at separate trials of the other crimes. The trial court did not err in instructing the jury on flight. Under mandatory review under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 177.055(2), the court found no error in defendant's death sentence. The evidence supported the finding of the 13 aggravating circumstances in this case, including those under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 200.033(2), (4), (8), (12). Given the appalling nature of the murder and defendant's character as revealed by his crimes, death was not an excessive sentence.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 338.020 and was therefore indebted to five claimants. The contractor petitioned for judicial review, which the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada, denied. The contractor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner ordered the contractor to pay wages it owed the claimants, who were undocumented aliens, assessed an administrative penalty, and mandated forfeitures. The appellate court held that he acted within the scope of the authority granted by Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 338.015 in conducting the hearing and that the claimants filed their wage claims within the period prescribed by Nev. Admin. Code &sect; 607.200. That the senior investigator conducted the investigation, the chief compliance audit investigator signed the complaint, and the Commissioner acted as the hearing officer did not make the procedure unfair. Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 422.065(1)(b), which denied public benefits to certain aliens, did not relieve the contractor of the duty to pay the prevailing wage to the claimants as payment of the prevailing wage was not a &quot;public benefit&quot; under 8 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1621. The evidence supported the finding that the claimants were not paid prevailing wages, the wage awards, and the forfeiture. However, assessing a penalty equal to the amount of unpaid wages was improper as Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 338.090(2)(a) authorized only one assessment equal to the prevailing wage-actual wage differential.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed that portion of the order with respect to the second penalty imposed and remanded to the district court with instructions to direct the Commissioner to reconsider the appropriate penalty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an accident, appellant motorist consented to a blood test, which indicated that he had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.272, an amount almost three times the legal limit in effect at the time of the accident. Thus, respondent, the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles, revoked his driver's license. The Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada, upheld the revocation. The motorist appealed, asserting a due process violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the officer arrived at the one vehicle accident scene, the motorist exhibited substantial signs of intoxication. However, the motorist asserted that he had walked home after the accident and had returned two hours later. At the revocation hearing, he testified that he had several beers and several shots of tequila while he was at home. The issue on appeal was whether he had a due process right at the revocation hearing to present evidence that his or alcohol level was based on alcohol consumed after driving. The Nevada Supreme Court noted that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 484.384 did not create an impermissible and irrebuttable presumption that an individual's blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit at the time of driving. However, the supreme court held that when an individual challenged the revocation of his or her license at an administrative hearing, that hearing had to provide the opportunity for a driver to present evidence that he or she consumed alcohol only after driving. In the instant case, the motorist was given that opportunity. Unfortunately for him, the administrative law judge determined that his testimony was not credible. Thus, he was not denied due process.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that his convictions for false imprisonment in the robbery must be reversed because the district court did not properly instruct the jury on the elements of the offense. The supreme court agreed. Defendant contended that to convict him of false imprisonment, the jury had to find that the detention of the victims was not incidental to the robbery. Defendant conceded that false imprisonment was a lesser-included offense of the crime of kidnapping, but he argued that because some movement or confinement was inherent in any robbery, punishment for his robbery and false imprisonment amounted to a double punishment not contemplated by the legislature. Defendant attempted to rob three individuals and then directed them to a back room. He did not tie them up, but merely closed the door and attempted to lock them in. Therefore, the facts that were the basis of the false imprisonment convictions were part of and incidental to the conviction of attempting to rob the three individuals taken to the back room. In addition, because there was no proof of a separate agreement, defendant's conviction for conspiracy to rob one victim could not stand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The false imprisonment and conspiracy to commit robbery convictions were reversed. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

R. Civ. P. 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arrestee's action was against the State for false imprisonment among other things. The scam victim's case was against the hotel owner for not warning him about a con artist. The appeals involved first impression issues regarding orders that placed permanent restrictions on the access of litigants with in forma pauperis status to state courts. The court held that the restrictive order against the arrestee was not proper because the trial court never warned the arrestee, the order did not sufficiently indicate that he had previously instituted other meritless suits, and it failed to set a standard against which future court-access could be determined. Also, summary judgment was not proper in that case because there were genuine issues of fact, and the justice of the peace's determination to hold the arrestee was not irrebuttable evidence of probable cause to arrest. The court held that the order regarding the scam victim was different as he was warned and there were substantive findings as to the frivolous nature of his prior claims. While the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the complaint for failure to post security, the complaint clearly failed to state a claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order dismissing the scam victim's complaint and concluded that the vexatious litigant order restricting his access to the court was warranted.

The court concluded that in a prosecution seeking death for a felony murder, an aggravator based on the underlying felony did not constitutionally narrow death eligibility. However, because defendant admitted to deliberate, premeditated murder, the State's alternative theory of felony murder was of no consequence and provided no ground for relief. Nevada's use of lethal injection as the method of execution was constitutional. The district court properly admitted several pieces of &quot;bad act&quot; evidence against defendant during the penalty hearing. There was no evidence of prosecutorial misconduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state university sought review of a judgment of the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada), which denied the university's motion for summary judgment and entered judgment for respondent former professor in his action claiming breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and seeking declaratory relief for alleged violations of his substantive and procedural due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After tendering an employment contract to the professor for 1999-2000 pursuant to a 1999 court order, the university proceeded to terminate his employment as a result of his unsatisfactory evaluations in 1990 and 1991. The district court properly denied the university's motion for summary judgment and allowed the breach-of-contract claims to proceed to trial because the termination hearing violated the specific terms of the 1999-2000 contract. It was thus unnecessary to evaluate whether the university's decision was entitled to immunity as a discretionary action, and the question before the district court was not judicial review of the termination decision but whether the contract allowed the university to proceed with the hearing. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying a request to apply issue preclusion because the issues decided during the termination proceedings were not identical to those presented in the professor's district court complaint. Finally, the district court did not err by denying the university's motion for a directed verdict because the evidence presented was not so overwhelming that any other verdict would have been contrary to the law.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed under a United States Supreme Court decision that voided a similar Son of Sam statute based upon First Amendment considerations. The trial court found a First Amendment violation despite determining the statute addressed compelling state interests in reimbursing crime victims and prohibiting profiteering from criminal activity. The parties raised issues concerning whether the statute involved state action, was content-based, and narrowly addressed compelling state interests. It was a content-based restriction on speech, the validity of which was subject to the strict scrutiny analysis. Although the measure addressed compelling state interests, it suffered from overinclusiveness because it regulated more speech than necessary to serve the state's interest; it allowed recovery of proceeds from works including expression both related and unrelated to the crime, imposing a disincentive to engage in public discourse and nonexploitative discussion of it.

The commission appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted that the commission's express statutory power to recover and waive or reduce penalties necessarily depended on the implicit power to determine whether a candidate's filing qualified as a financial disclosure statement. Provisions of the Ethics in Government Law vested the commission with the power to determine the adequacy of a candidate's financial disclosure statement. The commission had the power to seek the statutorily-accrued civil penalties against the candidates. The candidates' notices in lieu of statement of financial disclosure and related filings were so devoid of the necessary information that they could not be considered financial disclosure statements. Because the commission did not institute a civil action to recover the penalties while it had the statutory authority to do so, any such action now fell to the Secretary of State. The statutes were not vague and the candidates offered no evidence to show that the financial disclosure statutes had a chilling effect on the exercise of any First Amendment rights. Candidates were required to file financial disclosure statements only if they ran for public office, a purely voluntary act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first ordinance, Mesquite, Nev., Ordinance MQ1, governed public land sales, requiring the city to conduct all public land sales by a public auction or a public sealed bid process. The second ordinance, Mesquite, Nev., Ordinance MQ3, governed candidacy eligibility, requiring an elected official or public employee to file his resignation from office/employment before seeking election as mayor or city council member. The district court determined that the first ordinance was invalid, inasmuch as it conflicted with Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 266.267(1), Nev. Rev. Stat.&nbsp;&sect; 268.050, and Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 277.050, but determined that the severability clause of MQ1 saved it from being wholly invalid. Yet, MQ1 essentially eliminated the portion of &sect; 266.267(1) that allowed the city council to lease, sell, or exchange land at a price lower than the appraised price if it was in the best interest of the public.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a county transportation commission and a state university system, challenged a decision of the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada), which issued a preliminary injunction enjoining appellants from interfering with respondent group's petition-circulating activities in violation of the First Amendment and Nev. Const. art. 1, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The group gathered signatures on a referendum petition and an initiative petition to be placed on a ballot. The group was denied access to commission and university property. The court held: (1) although Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 293.127565 created an obligation for the commission and university to provide areas for signature gathering, commission and university properties were limited public forums, and their policies were reviewed under the reasonableness standard generally applied to time, place, and manner restrictions of limited public and nonpublic forums; (4) under the First Amendment, there was nothing inherently unreasonable in requiring a petition circulator to provide advance notice of his or her intended signature-gathering activities; (5) because the university building was occupied by a private party, &sect; 293.127565 did not apply because it was only applied to buildings that were physically occupied by the government at the time in question; and (6) the commission regulations requiring a three-day notice and dictating that the designated area should be one that could be completely avoided by the public were unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that portion of the preliminary injunction relating to the commission to the extent that it related to the guidelines regarding notice, designated area, and signing a commission request form.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Nevada Secretary of State and two associations, sought review of a judgment from the First Judicial District Court, Carson City (Nevada), which, in an action brought by respondent initiative proponents, declared affidavit requirements for petition circulators to be unconstitutional and ordered the Secretary to qualify signatures that had been stricken from two initiative petitions and to place the initiatives on the ballot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Nev. Const. art. 19, &sect; 3(1), the Secretary discounted thousands of signatures in booklets that lacked a valid affidavit signed by a registered voter who signed that particular booklet. The initiative proponents argued that the affidavit requirement violated the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, by burdening political speech. The court found merit in that argument, because the First Amendment precluded states from requiring petition circulators to be registered voters. Because Nev. Const. art. 19, &sect; 2(2) permitted only registered voters to sign an initiative petition, a circulator could not authenticate signatures unless he or she was a registered voter. Under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 295.055(2), voters could sign a petition only in the county in which they were registered. Thus, only voters registered in the county of circulation could serve as affiants. Consequently, the court concluded that Nev. Const. art. 19, &sect; 3(1) severely burdened political speech and that the burden was exacerbated by Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 295.055(2). The affidavit requirement did not tangibly advance the State's interests in preventing corruption.</SPAN></P>

She presented no specific evidence to demonstrate or explain why this issue could not have been raised either at trial or on direct appeal. Further, while marijuana metabolite was not listed on either schedule, it was clear from the plain language of both Nev. Rev.

The court held that the Secretary lacked standing to seek mandamus relief in order to exclude government employees from serving in the Legislature, as the Secretary had no discernible interest and only had standing to seek enforcement of election laws. The court found that the matter was not ripe for review, because the Secretary requested that relief apply on a prospective basis, and that, until executive branch employees were actually seated in the legislative session, there was no concrete controversy to resolve. The court also held that the Secretary sued the wrong party, because the authority to determine members' qualifications rested with each House, rather than the Legislature as a whole, thus the Secretary sought to compel an act that the Legislature as a whole had no legal authority to perform. The court concluded that, even if the Secretary had standing and sued the correct parties at the proper time, quo warranto, rather than mandamus, was the proper mechanism to try title to a public office.</SPAN></P>

The victim was severely injured, such that he required plastic surgery and the installation of titanium plates in his face. The appellate court held: (1) the trial court's clerical error in allowing the two erroneous jury instructions into the jury's deliberations was harmless, given its instruction to disregard same; (2) the trial court did not err in allowing jurors to present written questions to the witnesses after the trial court approved those questions; (3) the prosecutor did not comment on defendant's failure to testify by stating defendant did not present an accurate account of how the assault occurred; (4) substantial evidence supported defendant's conviction, and (5) defendant's 60 month sentence, within the statutory guidelines, was not cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Seventh Judicial District Court, White Pine County, Nevada, terminated the parental rights of appellant mother and father to their three children. The mother and father appealed, arguing that clear and convincing evidence did not support the termination of their parental rights. The father also contended that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 128.109(2) was unconstitutional because it infringed on his substantive due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of the termination hearing, the children had been in foster care for over 30 months. Therefore, pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 128.109(2), it was presumed that their best interest was served by parental termination. The supreme court held that &sect; 128.109(2) was constitutional, as it was narrowly tailored to serve the State's compelling interest in seeking permanent placement for children rather than having them remain in foster care. The trial court found that the parents were unfit, had made only token efforts to regain custody, and that terminating their parental rights was in the children's best interests. The supreme court found that substantial evidence supported these findings: (1) the mother failed to overcome her drug problems; (2) despite going to anger management and domestic violence courses, the father failed to control his temper; (3) he had three domestic violence convictions and was incarcerated at the time of the hearing; (4) he failed to communicate with the children for almost two years; (5) the children were present during several episodes of domestic violence between the parents; and (6) the children made positive adjustments while in foster care.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was stabbed to death during a robbery. The victim described his assailant. Another witness also identified a man he saw fleeing. A third witness described how she helped the inmate. During sentencing, the jury found aggravating circumstances. Appellate counsel, however, was ineffective for failing to challenge the aggravating circumstance of depravity of mind, as the jury instructions failed to provide the constitutionally required guidance to jurors. The inmate claimed that the prosecutor withheld information regarding benefits given to an important witness. Nevertheless, the outcome would not have been different had this information been disclosed. The inmate also contended that the State withheld the fact that shoeprints near the victim were already present when the first police officer arrived at the crime scene. This fact, however, was not material in determining whether trial counsel was ineffective. The inmate also claimed that the State committed a Brady violation. The challenged information, though, was readily available to the defense. As to whether key evidence was not preserved, the inmate failed to show bad faith, or that the evidence was exculpatory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The First Judicial District Court, Carson City, Nevada, denied the motion of appellant Office of the Attorney General, Division of Consumer Protection (BCP) for a preliminary injunction against respondent telecommunication companies seeking to enjoin the companies from engaging in allegedly deceptive trade practices. The BCP appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court denied the BCP injunctive relief, concluding that an existing administrative hearing was an adequate remedy at law. The appellate court found that because the BCP did not assert an affirmative claim for injunctive relief in its answer or through a counterclaim and did not attach affidavits containing admissible statements or admissible documents to the motion, the motion for preliminary injunction was procedurally defective. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the BCP injunctive relief. However, the appellate court addressed the merits of the district court's ruling. The appellate court determined that, by considering whether the BCP had an adequate legal remedy, the district court erred because equitable considerations, such as irreparable harm and an inadequate legal remedy, were presumed in a statutory enforcement action. The only issue before the district court was whether the BCP presented admissible evidence establishing a reasonable likelihood that the companies were engaging in deceptive trade practices. Once such a showing was made, an injunction should issue.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court agreed that defendant's trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to a Petrocelli instruction. Further, there was a reasonable probability that jurors mistakenly believed that defendant could eventually receive parole even if they returned sentences of life in prison without parole and that this belief contributed to their decision to render verdicts of death. As such, a new penalty hearing was required. Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to victim impact evidence and a jury instruction regarding premeditation. The prosecutor's comment that there was no program that rehabilitated killers and that defendant was deserving of the same sympathy, compassion, and mercy that he extended to the victims were improper and trial counsel should have objected to them.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that the retroactivity rules applicable to decisions interpreting federal criminal statutes and decisions announcing constitutional rules of criminal procedure required the retroactive application of the definition of deadly weapons should not include a red-hot table fork and heated electric iron, as those were not weapons that could readily cause death. At the time of appellants' crimes, Nev. Rev. Stat. 193.165 did not define &quot;deadly weapon,&quot; but required imposition of a sentence equal and consecutive to the term of imprisonment prescribed by statute for the crime being committed with the use of a firearm or other deadly weapon. The court held that the appellants could not avoid the law of the case, which upheld the validity of their sentence enhancements, and that appellants failed to overcome the procedural bars of Nev. Rev. Stat. 34.726 and 34.810 as to untimely and subsequent petitions. The applicable state and federal precedent required limited retroactivity on collateral review, but neither upset the usual rule of non-retroactivity for rules that carried no constitutional significance.</SPAN></P>

At the conclusion of the penalty hearing, the jury determined that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances and rendered a verdict of death.

Nevertheless, the court concluded that the finding of the improper aggravator in this case, combined with the prejudicial impact of Brady violations so undermined the reliability of the jury's sentencing determination that the application of procedural bars to preclude consideration of defendant's claim would amount to a fundamental miscarriage of justice. The facts of this case did not support the finding aggravator that defendant killed the store clerk at random and without apparent motive; the state showed only that defendant unnecessarily killed the clerk in connection with the attempted robbery. The court was unable to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a sentence of death without the aggravating circumstance and in the absence of the State's Brady violations.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court determined that &sect; 62.590 was void for vagueness and reversed the portion of the order requiring the juvenile to undergo the hearing. Section 62.590 provided no guidance with respect to how a child should conduct himself to avoid lifetime sex offender registration; a child could successfully complete counseling and substance abuse treatment programs but because of &sect; 62.590's express language could still face registration, given the lack of standards for a court to use in determining whether a child is rehabilitated or poses a continuing threat to society. Because &sect; 62.590 provided no guidance for the child to &quot;act accordingly&quot; and authorized arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, it was unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To resolve a legislative impasse, the court partially granted a writ of mandamus filed by petitioner, the Governor of the State of Nevada, and issued a writ directing respondent, the state legislature, to proceed expeditiously with the 20th Special Session under simple majority rule. Counter-petitioners, 20 state legislators, filed a rehearing petition, asking the court to recall the writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A legislative stalemate was thrust upon the state as the result of a recent Nevada constitutional amendment, Nev. Const. art. 4, &sect; 18(2), requiring a two-thirds majority to pass legislation that created, generated, or increased any public revenue, including taxes. The Senate passed legislation that would have completed the budget process, but the Assembly deadlocked. The deadlock prevented the Assembly from funding the K-12 appropriations bill. The court concluded, based on the calamitous circumstances facing the state, that the legislature could proceed with the 20th Special Session under a simple majority requirement. In a petition for rehearing, legislators strenuously argued that the two-thirds supermajority provision necessarily predominated over the simple majority provision governing appropriations. The court did not reach these issues, however, because the petition for rehearing became moot when the legislature later passed the revenue-generating bills by the requisite two-thirds vote.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Second Judicial District Court, Washoe County (Nevada). A three-judge panel imposed a sentence of death after defendant was convicted of first-degree murder at the conclusion of a bench trial. The panel found two aggravating circumstances, that defendant committed the murder while under sentence of imprisonment and that he committed the murder while committing or fleeing after committing a sexual assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was strangled to death after suffering forceful traumatic sexual penetration. Before trial, defendant personally informed the district court that he would like to waive the jury trial and have a bench trial. At a subsequent hearing, defendant said that he understood that, if he were found guilty, a three-judge panel would decide the sentence. At a third hearing, the district court granted the request after determining that defendant had considered and discussed the consequences of waiving a jury trial with his counsel. In the penalty phase, the panel found both aggravators beyond a reasonable doubt and found that all the mitigating circumstances did not outweigh the sexual assault aggravating circumstance alone. The court held that defendant validly waived his right to have his sentence determined by a jury and that the sentence was not excessive. The court emphasized that two aggravating circumstances existed and that defendant had had an extensive, ongoing criminal history, including another strangulation murder of a female victim. There was no evidence of an emotionally charged confrontation, nor was there evidence that defendant lacked rational capacity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a city redevelopment agency and an anchor project, sought review of an order of the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada), which granted respondent property owners' motion to dismiss the agency's eminent domain complaint. The owners filed a cross-appeal from an order dismissing their counterclaims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agency identified various physical, economic, and social conditions within the area constituting &quot;blight&quot; under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 279.388. These conditions included increased crime rates and requirements for police assistance, business flight from the area, decline in tourism, lack of parking, perceptions of lack of safety, and increases in vacant and aging buildings. The court initially rejected appellants' estoppel claim but held that for all future eminent domain cases, challenges to a public taking had to be raised prior to occupancy and material demolition, alteration, or construction on the property. The court found that there was a rational relationship to justify the exercise of eminent domain. The agency's purpose for entering into the redevelopment agreement was to construct a safe entertainment street mall to attract visitors and business back to the downtown area. The project's central focus was to combat economic, social, and physical blight, a public purpose, not to service a single business. Even if the plan had been challenged within the 90-day period, as provided by Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 279.609, substantial evidence supported the agency's determination of blight.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the district court dismissing the complaint in eminent domain and that portion of the district court's subsequent order pertaining to the lost rent claims. The court remanded the matter to the district court for further proceedings. The court affirmed the remaining portion of the district court's order dismissing the counterclaims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a second postconviction proceeding, the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada, granted partial relief to respondent petitioner, who sought a writ of habeas corpus. The district court vacated petitioner's death sentence and granted him a new penalty hearing. The State appealed from that part of the order vacating petitioner's sentence, and petitioner appealed from the part denying the remainder of his petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court concluded that petitioner's death sentence should be vacated because the jury's finding of depravity of mind as an aggravating circumstance, without a proper limiting instruction on depravity of mind, was unconstitutional. The jury found that the murder committed by petitioner involved depravity of mind as well as four other aggravating circumstances. The State argued that the district court erred in vacating the death sentence based on the invalid aggravator. Although the State did not dispute that the instruction was inadequate, it argued that the error was harmless or in the alternative that the instant court should uphold the death sentence after reweighing the four valid aggravators against nonexistent mitigating evidence. The instant court concluded that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Petitioner established prejudice under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 34.810. The weight of the other aggravating circumstances was not so great that the instant court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a death sentence even without the invalid aggravator, especially considering the emphasis the State placed on depravity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court affirmed the district court's order vacating petitioner's death sentence and granting a new penalty hearing. Because the other issues raised by petitioner did not warrant relief, the instant court also affirmed the district court's order insofar as it otherwise upheld petitioner's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendant maintained that he was unable to pay child support while incarcerated. On appeal, he argued that: (1) the &quot;without good cause&quot; language in Nev. Rev.

Stat. &sect; 201.020, thereby miscalculating his arrearages; and (3) insufficient evidence supported his conviction, given that he did not have significant ability or opportunity to pay child support while incarcerated. The instant court concluded that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 201.051 was not vague and was constitutional. Moreover, because Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 201.051 was an affirmative defense statute, it did not encourage arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. Defendant accumulated arrearages in excess of $ 10,000 by failing to make a single child support payment from July 1998 to April 2001. Accordingly, the State properly charged defendant with violating Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 201.020. Although incarceration could be asserted as an affirmative defense, sufficient evidence supported defendant's conviction because the jury had good reason to reject his affirmative defense of incarceration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Nev. Rev.

This allowed the father's 15-year-old daughter to marry a 48-year-old man with the consent of her mother. The father argued that the statute was unconstitutional. The appellate court found that the right to marry was a fundamental right. The statute provided a safeguard against an erroneous marriage decision by the minor and the consenting parent, by giving the district court the discretion to withhold authorization if it found that there were no extraordinary circumstances and/or the proposed marriage was not in the minor's best interest. The father lost his right to exercise legal control over his daughter during her minority. He still had the other legal and social attributes of parenthood. The state had an interest in fostering appropriate marriages and tailoring its statutes in such a way as to take into account the individual variations in maturity, rather than just setting an arbitrary rule of age.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city filed a criminal complaint charging defendant with one count of annoying a minor pursuant to former Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 207.260. The Nevada District Court ruled that former &sect; 207.260 was unconstitutionally vague. The city petitioned for extraordinary relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the city argued that the trial court erred determining that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 270.260 was unconstitutionally vague. The supreme court found that the criminal complaint merely charged that defendant had willfully and unlawfully &quot;annoyed&quot; a minor; it did not allege that defendant had &quot;molested&quot; a minor. The language of the statute did not specify what type of annoying behavior was prohibited, nor did it define the term &quot;molest.&quot; By its terms, the statute was not limited only to annoyances of a sexual nature, and it provided no indication of whether the perpetrator must subjectively intend to annoy the minor, or if mere unintentional, bothersome conduct, in and of itself, was sufficient to subject an individual to criminal sanctions. Further, because the statute failed to adequately set forth the conduct proscribed, it provided those charged with enforcement of its provisions unfettered and unguided discretion to decide what annoying activity fell within its parameters. Accordingly, the supreme court held that the statute was facially invalid because it: (1) failed to provide fair notice of the prohibited conduct; and (2) authorized and encouraged arbitrary enforcement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of a plea agreement, one defendant entered a plea of guilty but mentally ill in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada), to two counts of burglary, one count of open and gross lewdness, and two counts of sexual assault on a victim 65 years of age or older. The second defendant pled guilty to an amended information charging him with battery with intent to kill with the use of a deadly weapon. Both defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants presented the issue as to whether the supreme court's decision in Finger v. State automatically entitled a defendant convicted pursuant to a guilty but mentally ill plea to withdraw that plea and proceed to trial. One defendant, relying on the supreme court's decision in Finger, sought to withdraw his plea, enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, and proceed to trial. The second defendant argued his case should be remanded to the trial court to allow him to withdraw his plea of guilty but mentally ill, enter a plea of not guilty, and proceed to trial. Both defendants based their appeal on the premise that mental illness prevented them from understanding the consequences of the plea. The statutory scheme under which defendants entered their pleas was unconstitutional and unenforceable. Therefore, the supreme court held that both of the cases must be remanded to the trial court and defendants be provided an opportunity to enter new pleas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both of the cases were remanded to the trial court where defendants were be provided an opportunity to enter new pleas. On remand, the State would not be bound by any plea negotiations previously agreed to by the parties and the original charges in both cases may be reinstated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The underlying actions involved separate cases in which defendants were charged with possession of a majority of the ingredients required to manufacture a controlled substance in violation of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 453.322(1)(b). In both cases, the Second Judicial District Court, Washoe County, Nevada, ruled that the statute was void for vagueness and, therefore, unconstitutional. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State challenged the trial court's rulings on two grounds: (1) the trial court did not determine whether the statute was vague as applied to defendants (in both cases); and (2) the trial court failed to address whether the statute was vague in all of its applications. The supreme court agreed with the trial court, finding that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 453.322(1)(b) was facially vague because it infringed on constitutionally protected conduct, was incapable of any valid applications, failed to provide sufficient notice of the prohibited conduct, and encouraged arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The statute contained no intent element, yet imposed criminal sanctions on what was otherwise non-criminal activity. Further, the statute failed to list the items that might be described as &quot;ingredients&quot; required to manufacture or compound a controlled substance. Moreover, the absence of an intent element and the ambiguities regarding the required ingredients allowed arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. Thus, the statute, as written, failed to provide law enforcement with adequate guidance concerning the precise scope of activities it aspires to proscribe.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of resisting a public officer when he refused to provide identification to a police officer. On appeal, the Nevada District Court held it was reasonable and necessary for the officer to request identification from defendant, and affirmed defendant's conviction. Defendant petitioned for a writ of certiorari, challenging the constitutionality of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 171.123(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the supreme court determined that the issue of the constitutionality of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 171.123(3) presented an issue of first impression. In the instant case, an officer responded to a concerned citizen's call regarding an observed assault. The officer approached defendant and requested identification after suspecting that defendant had engaged in driving under the influence and domestic violence against his minor daughter. Defendant refused 11 times to identify himself and instead placed his hands behind his back and challenged the officer to take him to jail. The supreme court determined that an ordinary person would conclude it was defendant who was unreasonable, not the law. Further, &sect; 171.123(3) was narrowly written as it applied only in situations where an officer had an articulable suspicion that a person was engaged in criminal behavior. Requiring defendant, who was reasonably suspected of committing a crime, to identify himself was a commonsense requirement to protect both the public and the officer. Thus, the supreme court concluded that &sect; 171.123(3) was good law consistent with the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court decided that two administrative remedies existed: (1) seeking a refund for illegally collected taxes, or (2) seeking an advisory opinion from the department regarding the constitutionality of the statutes upon which the taxes were based. The district court determined that the taxpayers should have exhausted those remedies before seeking relief in the district court. The taxpayers challenged the constitutionality of the statutes as applied to them. Resolution of the taxpayers' constitutional challenges hinged upon factual determinations. The constitutionality of the statutes challenged here, as applied, involved a factual evaluation, best left to the Department of Taxation, which could utilize its specialized skill and knowledge to inquire into the facts of the case. Since the taxpayers did not exhaust their administrative remedies, the district court properly dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner robbed a convenience store and fatally shot the clerk. Petitioner was convicted of burglary, robbery with the use of a deadly weapon, and first-degree murder with the use of a deadly weapon.

The court affirmed petitioner's conviction and sentence. Petitioner filed a timely post-conviction petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The district court denied petitioner's petition. On appeal, the court vacated the sentence and remanded. Petitioner received constitutionally effective assistance of trial and appellate counsel. He was not entitled to relief because of alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. While the facts supported the robbery and burglary sentencing aggravators, the facts did not support the jury finding that petitioner killed the clerk at random and without apparent motive. It was improperly based upon the fact that the killing was unnecessary to complete the robbery.

Even if the guilty verdicts necessarily entailed the jury's finding of the two aggravators found by the three-judge panel, the guilt-phase verdicts did not and could not have entailed the required consideration of mitigating evidence. That evidence and that consideration were not presented to the jury until the penalty phase. The facts from the first penalty hearing did not establish harmless error either. Even assuming that the jury forms were proof of the jurors' findings, there was no verdict form or other evidence showing that the jurors unanimously agreed that the mitigating circumstances did not outweigh the aggravating circumstances, making defendant eligible for death.

The appellate court found that nothing indicated that defendant objected or refused to submit to the psychosexual evaluation when he was interviewed.  Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 176A.110 prohibited the district court from placing defendant on probation unless the person who conducted the evaluation certified that defendant was not a menace to the health, safety, or morals of others. Defendant never asserted his Fifth Amendment rights during the clinical interviews nor did he refuse to participate in the evaluations. Probation was a form of leniency and defendant was not penalized for refusing to admit guilt to the underlying offense. Presenting defendant with the choice between admitting responsibility for the offense to which he pleaded guilty and increasing the likelihood of receiving a favorable psychosexual evaluation, or denying responsibility for the offense and reducing the likelihood of a favorable psychosexual evaluation did not violate the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

The district court entered a written order declaring the initiative unconstitutional and enjoined the registrar of voters from placing the initiative on any city ballot. The citizens appealed. The supreme court held en banc that the initiative concerned an administrative matter, which exceeded the electorate's initiative power, and that the district court properly enjoined its inclusion on the ballot.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction and claimed that his conviction was invalid due to numerous errors made by the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant brutally stabbed his ex-wife in front of their young daughter after having threatened to kill her on many occasions; the ex-wife had a protective order against him. Defendant took the child after the murder. Defendant claimed he could not kidnap his own daughter. During trial, the trial court sustained defendant's objections to the State's comments that the victim's family could no longer vacation with her and that the State disagreed with a defense witness. The appellate court held that defendant's taking of his daughter was unlawful, as he violated a protective order, a custody decree, and criminal statutes when he murdered the ex-wife; his status as sole surviving parent of the child did not render his seizure of the child lawful. The court also held that while the State's comments were improper, neither so infected either the guilt or penalty phase with unfairness as to deny defendant due process. Finally, the death sentence was held not to be excessive even though many mitigating factors existed, as defendant stalked his wife, murdered her without provocation in a horrific, savage manner; and did so in the presence of her, and his own, young daughter.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. Traffic safety was a rational basis for upholding statutes that regulated the use of substances that might impair a person's ability to drive. Banning driving by persons with any measurable amount of illicit drugs was constitutional because the legislature was reasonable in determining that there was no level of illicit drug use which could be acceptably combined with driving a vehicle; the established potential for lethal consequences was too great. The governmental interest in maintaining safe highways was sufficient for the prohibited substance statute to survive a constitutional attack on the basis that it impermissibly treated drivers with the proscribed levels of illicit drugs in their system differently from others.</SPAN></P>

Under that statute, the district court permitted a 15-year-old to marry a 48-year-old man. Although the 15-year-old's mother provided consent, her father had no knowledge that his daughter was planning to marry. On review, the state supreme court determined &sect; 122.025 was unconstitutionally applied, because the father, who had an on-going personal and custodial relationship with his daughter, was provided neither notice nor an opportunity to be heard before his daughter was given judicial permission to marry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sixth Judicial District Court, Humboldt County (Nevada) convicted defendant of three counts of sale of a controlled substance and one count of simple possession. Thereafter, defendant was sentenced to 12 to 48 months in prison for each sales count, with an enhancement for being within 1,000 feet of a school. In addition, defendant was sentenced to a concurrent term of imprisonment of 12 to 30 months for possession. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the district court committed reversible constitutional error by determining the sentence enhancement, rather than submitting the issue to the jury. Defendant argued that Apprendi required that any fact, other than a prior conviction, that increased the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum was required to be submitted to the jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. In addition, defendant argued that the application of the sentence enhancement was not harmless because such an argument ignored the central importance of the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. Defendant's failure to present any evidence to dispute that his residence was not within 1,000 feet of the schoolyard together with his specific request that the district court, not the jury, determine the distance of his residence from the schoolyard constituted a waiver of his rights under Apprendi. While an Apprendi violation occurred in defendant's trial and sentencing, defendant affirmatively waived his protections under Apprendi and could not complain of the violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was at a bar when he saw an individual that he hated. The evidence at trial indicated that the defendant killed the victim and then had his friend help him put the victim in a dumpster. During the trial, defense counsel did not want to call a certain witness fearing it would do more harm then good. The defendant enlisted the court's assistance in calling the witness and then argued on appeal that the court should not have intervened. The state supreme court held that while the court should not have been involved in deciding who should be called by the defense, the defendant could not complain, as he invited the court's error. The court held sufficient evidence existed to convict the defendant under first-degree murder, even though he was acquitted of robbery charges. The prosecutor did not commit misconduct during closing by suggesting that the defendant's tennis shoes were missing, as they were incriminating. The defendant failed to show systematic exclusion of Latinos in the selection of the jury pool and did not timely object to the State's peremptory challenges against women jurors. The court considered and dismissed the defendant's other challenges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner, a prostitute, contended that the district attorney's prosecution policy violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. On appeal from the Las Vegas Justice Court, the Clark County District Court (Nevada) concluded the policy was constitutional. Thereafter the district court stayed the justice court proceedings until the instant court addressed the constitutional issues by way of extraordinary writ.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district attorney's office implemented a policy that prohibited plea negotiations with sellers of sex who were charged with solicitation of prostitution. The prostitute contended the policy discriminated against females and sought one of three extraordinary writs to obtain relief from alleged selective prosecution: a writ of certiorari, a writ of mandamus, or a writ of prohibition. The supreme court noted it was constitutionally permissible to treat prostitutes differently than their customers. The supreme court held the policy did not violate the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Nevada Constitutions, and concluded that extraordinary relief was not warranted. Moreover, the legislature had vested the district attorney with prosecutorial discretion and it was within the purview of his prosecution powers to treat buyers of sex differently than sellers of sex. Finally, the supreme court held the prostitute failed to prove the district attorney's decision to prosecute arose from an impermissible desire to discriminate on the basis of race, gender, or other protected class. Therefore, neither the federal or state constitutions compelled intervention.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the case was one of prosecutorial discretion and not unconstitutional selective prosecution, the prostitute's petition for extraordinary relief was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue in this case was whether Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 34.726 and its one-year time bar applied to second or successive petitions for postconviction relief. The petitioner argued that &sect; 34.726 applied just to first petitions and that dismissal for delayed filing of second or successive petitions was governed only by the laches provisions of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 34.800. The instant court rejected this contention and concluded that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 34.726 applied to all postconviction petitions, including successive petitions. The doctrine of equitable estoppel did not prevent the State from asserting and the courts from applying &sect; 34.726 in cases of successive petitions. The instant court found that &sect; 34.726 was not constitutionally infirm, but was a reasonable regulation of the right to pursue habeas corpus. The petitioner failed to allege a sufficient basis to show good cause to excuse the procedural bars or to conclude that a fundamental miscarriage of justice would have occurred from the failure to consider his claims for relief on the merits. Thus, the trial court did not err in declining to conduct an evidentiary hearing on these issues.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence. However, the imposition of the death penalty was excessive.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county clerk argued that the county clerk was the sole person constitutionally designated as responsible for performing the duties associated with the court clerk. According to the county clerk, the district court had usurped her position as ex officio court clerk of the district court in violation of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 35.120. The instant court held that the district court did not usurp the office of county clerk by assuming direct control over the functions of the court clerk. The court clerk was not a constitutional office. Rather, it was a ministerial office inherent to the judicial branch of government. The court clerk's duties could be performed, in whole or in part, either by the county clerk pursuant to legislative enactment, or by the district court pursuant to court rule. The county clerk had no inherent, inalienable, or unbridled right to perform the office of court clerk without direction from the district court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was convicted of second-degree murder in the Clark County District Court (Nevada). The supreme court dismissed the defendant's direct appeal. He then filed a post-conviction petition for a writ of habeas corpus which the trial court denied. The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was involved in a confrontation that ended in him ramming the victim's car and killing him. The defendant argued that the trial court erred in dismissing his writ of habeas corpus because: (1) his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request a jury instruction on the lesser charge of reckless driving causing substantial bodily harm; and (2) his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 200.070 was unconstitutionally vague. The supreme court held that the trial court had not erred because: (1) the proper test for whether an offense was a lesser included offense was whether the elements of a lesser offense were an entirely included subset of the elements of the charged offense (the supreme court arrived at that conclusion by overruling Owens v. State, 100 Nev. 286, 680 P.2d 593 (1984)); and (2) &sect; 200.070 simply distinguished manslaughter from murder by referring to the factors which indicated malice, and none of the minor traffic violations cited by the defendant would naturally tend to destroy the life of a human being, thus, the commission of those minor offenses would not automatically render a killing murder.</SPAN></P>

The Nevada Supreme Court found that: (1) the sentencing provisions of Nev. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with one count of open murder. The Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada) denied his request to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, and appellant subsequently entered a plea of &quot;guilty but mentally ill&quot; to a charge of second-degree murder. The court convicted him on that charge and sentenced him to life imprisonment. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant alleged that Nevada's abolishment of insanity as an affirmative defense violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Nev. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 6 and 8(5). The Supreme Court of Nevada held that the current statutory scheme would permit an individual to be convicted of a criminal offense under circumstances where the individual lacked the mental capacity to form the applicable intent to commit the crime, a necessary element of the offense. The legislative history involving Senate Bill 314 (Nev. 1995) and the amendment of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 193.220 led appellant to believe he would have been prohibited from arguing legal insanity as defined by M'Naghten; consequently his plea of &quot;guilty, but mentally ill&quot; was not knowingly entered. The court concluded that the statutory scheme violated the due process clauses of the United States and Nevada Constitutions. In light of that conclusion, it was unnecessary to address appellant's arguments regarding cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment of conviction and remanded with instructions to permit appellant to withdraw his plea of guilty but mentally ill, and enter a plea of not guilty in accordance with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The BLM contended that the plain language of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 533.503 authorized the State to issue stockwater permits to the BLM, and if it did not, the statute was unconstitutional. The BLM argued that the phrase &quot;legally entitled&quot; was not ambiguous and meant that either the landowner, or a person with the landowner's permission to use the land, was legally entitled to place livestock on the land. The statute was not ambiguous. To say that the United States, as owner of the public land, had to issue itself a permit to lease or graze livestock upon the land was an illogical and unreasonable construction of the statutory language. The statute indicated it required an applicant to have some legal authority to use the public land for grazing purposes and nothing else. The BLM was a qualified applicant under Nev. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury returned death penalty verdicts on four counts of first-degree murder.

However, defendant's claim that his attorneys were ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor's comments during the penalty phase of the trial had merit. Some of the prosecutor's remarks were excessive and unacceptable and should have been challenged. The prosecutor's words were particularly designed to stir the jury's passion and appeal to partiality. The prosecutor incorrectly informed the jurors that they did not have to wait until a certain point in the deliberation to consider other matter evidence. The instructions did not cure the error introduced by the incorrect argument. A new penalty hearing was therefore required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Disciplinary complaints were brought against the attorney. The hearing panel found that he violated several professional conduct rules, including Rule 182, which prohibited him from directly contacting a represented party without the consent of that party's counsel. Rule 182 applied to communications by a lawyer appearing pro se or on behalf of his corporation. However, the rule as applied to the attorney when he was representing himself was unconstitutionally vague. The attorney could have reasonably concluded that the rule did not apply in situations where he was self-represented. The attorney's request for a continuance was properly denied. He had four weeks to obtain new counsel and to prepare for the hearing. By offering to dismiss a party from a conspiracy case in exchange for favorable testimony in a criminal case, the attorney violated Nev. Sup. Ct. R. 173(6). A pattern of misconduct was shown, and the attorney failed to acknowledge that his conduct was wrongful.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants contested a decision of the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada), granting respondents' request for a preliminary injunction in respondents' action alleging that appellants' practice of hiring canvassers to pass out leaflets on respondents' sidewalks soliciting business for erotic dance services constituted a trespass.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents were owners of private property who had conveyed to the relevant county a perpetual pedestrian easement across certain sidewalks that were owned by respondents. Respondents then sued appellant providers of referrals for erotic dance entertainment, alleging that appellants' practice of hiring canvassers to pass out leaflets on the sidewalks soliciting business for erotic dance services constituted a trespass. The trial court granted respondents' request for a preliminary injunction and appellants challenged that determination. The supreme court affirmed. The easement, by its express language, was limited to pedestrian use of the sidewalks for travel purposes. Accordingly, the existence of the easement alone did not transform the private sidewalks into a public forum for purposes of U.S. Const. amend. I. Furthermore, the trial court did not err in making a preliminary finding that the sidewalks were private property and therefore not subject to the reach of amend. I. Also, an injunction was an appropriate remedy for the threat of continuing trespass.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's decision granting respondents' request for a preliminary injunction was affirmed. Despite the existence of an easement permitting travel by pedestrians, respondents' privately owned sidewalks constituted private property that was not subject to the reach of constitutional free speech guarantees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant divorced the decedent after 26 years of marriage; they reconciled, but did not remarry, and at the time of decedent's death, he was paying all of appellant's non-housing expenses. She sought death benefits from the SIIS, since the decedent died from a work-related disease. The SIIS denied her claim, on grounds that she was not an eligible dependent under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 616C.505(8). She appealed to the lower court, which affirmed. She sought further review; the appellate court affirmed. The appellate court found that &sect; 616C.505(8) was ambiguous, and resorted to rules of statutory construction to interpret it. In doing so, it noted that the Nevada legislature, by adopting Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 616A.010, abolished the common law rule that the workers' compensation statutes were to be construed liberally in favor of an injured employee or his dependents. It held that &sect; 616C.505(8) provided death benefits for those who had a legally recognized relationship to, and were partially dependent upon, the deceased employee. As appellant had no such legally recognized relationship with decedent, the SIIS properly denied her claim for benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed, because as ex-spouse of decedent, appellant had no legally recognized relationship with him, and thus was not a dependent eligible for death benefits as defined by the workers' compensation statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent state education association filed an initiative for submission to the legislature, seeking to increase funding for the state's public schools. Appellants, numerous businesses, chambers of commerce, and business associations, challenged the initiative. The district court denied the challenge. On appeal, the supreme court reversed, holding that the initiative failed to comply with Nev. Const. art. 19, &sect; 6, which precluded any financial appropriation or expenditure without also imposing a tax sufficient to fund it. Although the legislature had a perpetual duty to fund education, it was not required to continue such funding at any particular level. A necessary appropriation or expenditure in any set amount or percentage was a new requirement that otherwise did not exist, and the proposed additional 4 percent tax was clearly insufficient to cover the initiative's required 50-percent-of-revenue appropriation. Further, the offending provision was not severable from the rest of the proposal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court judgment reversed. The initiative required a new appropriation and expenditure, and the proposed additional tax was not sufficient to cover the appropriation, as the state constitution required.

The court affirmed the conviction, finding the statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad or vague. As to overbreadth, the statute did not permit a probation officer to conduct a polygraph examination on any issue, except those relating to use of controlled substances by a probationer. Further the statute allowed a valid assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination if the probationer were asked for incriminating statements regarding crimes for which he had not been convicted. As to vagueness, because a person of common intelligence need not guess as to the statute's meaning and it was required to be read to further special needs inherent in supervising sex offenders, the statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court, District of Nevada, certified two questions to the Supreme Court (Nevada) pursuant to Nev. R. App. P. 5. The first was whether former Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 687B.385, which prohibited cancellation or nonrenewal of certain insurance policies, applied to homeowner's policies. The second was if the former Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 687B.385 as applied to homeowner's policies, violated the United States and Nevada Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insured sued respondent insurer for failing to renew the appellant's homeowner's policy, claiming the respondent violated former Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 687B.385, and the federal court certified two questions to the court. Respondent argued that the statute only applied to automobile insurance, not homeowner's policies. Respondent also argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it did not guarantee a fair and adequate return. The court held that the statute did apply to homeowner's policies, and that the statute was not facially unconstitutional under the Nevada Constitution. By its terms, the statute applied to homeowner's insurance policies, and the legislative history of the 1997 amendment did not change the construction of the earlier version. Additionally, the constitutional requirement of a fair and reasonable rate of return did not apply to individual policies. Instead, the constitutional rule applied to the entire range of policies issued by an insurer. While the statute could necessitate respondent sustaining a loss on an individual policy, it did not deprive respondent of a fair and reasonable rate of return generally on homeowner's protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former version of the statute did apply to homeowner's policies. Although the court did not have the authority to answer the second question as to the constitutionality of the statute under the United States Constitution, the court determined that the Nevada Constitution required that price fixing regulations guarantee a fair and reasonable return, and the statute was not facially invalid under that standard.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 3, &sect; 1; art. 6, &sect;&sect; 1, 9, and several statutory sources of judicial powers to conclude that a Nevada municipal court possessed the authority to collect reasonable fees pursuant to its inherent judicial powers. Those fees included reasonable filing fees on bail bonds. That inherent authority existed prior to and after the May 12, 1997 effective date of the more explicit authority of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 5.073(2) that provided that municipal courts could charge and collect fees prescribed in Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 4.060(1)(o): that each justice of the peace could charge and collect $ 40 for each bail or property bond filed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged her first degree murder conviction from the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada), contending the trial court erred by allowing flawed jury instructions and omitting certain of them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first degree murder. On appeal, she contended the trial court erred in charging the jury with a flawed instruction on malice aforethought and in denying her instruction on involuntary manslaughter. The court agreed, reversing her conviction, reasoning that the jury instruction on malice aforethought created an unconstitutional mandatory presumption of malice aforethought, which incorrectly relieved the State of its burden to prove every element of the crime charged. Further, use of the instruction was not harmless error, due to the fact that the case lacked an overwhelming evidence of guilt. It was thus not clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found appellant guilty of first degree murder absent the erroneous jury instruction. The court further erred in denying appellant's request for an involuntary manslaughter instruction because evidence revealed that the victim's death could have occurred by a fall or some other means besides child abuse, as the State alleged. In such a circumstance, the death would not have been a product of malice aforethought but possibly a result of neglect or endangerment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a citizens group seeking to recall respondent county commissioner, filed recall petitions, which respondent secretary of state determined were unsuccessful. The 60-day limitation in Nev. Rev. Code &sect; 306.015(3) did not violate petitioners' U.S. Const. amend. I rights. State's important regulatory interests were sufficient to justify the restrictions. Sixty-day limitation did not impose a severe burden on petitioners. Recall statutes promoted the efficient regulation of recall petitions. Recall procedures and statistical sampling did not fail to aid the operation of the recall right. Petitioners presented no evidence showing that the statistical procedure utilized was inaccurate. Nevada Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Nev. Rev.

Defendant's offenses were enhanced to felonies under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 484.3792(1)(c) because he had twice been convicted of misdemeanor driving under the influence. On appeal, defendant argued his prior offenses were improperly used to enhance his subsequent offenses. The court held defendant's misdemeanor convictions were valid because any failure to properly sentence him did not render such convictions void. Regardless, pursuant to Nev. Const. art. 6, &sect; 8, the legislature had authority to statutorily grant the justice courts jurisdiction to suspend sentences. The justice courts thus properly suspended defendant's misdemeanor sentences. The court concluded the county ordinance under which defendant was previously convicted did not require approval of the board of directors of the Nevada Department of Transportation because it was not enacted under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 484.779. The court affirmed defendant's convictions because the prior misdemeanor convictions were properly considered for enhancement purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sued respondents, an investment firm and its senior vice president, for conspiracy to commit conversion of securities. A jury awarded significant compensatory damages, jointly and severally, against respondents, and rendered separate punitive damage awards against respondents. The district court reduced the compensatory damage award to zero by applying equitable offsets, but let the punitive damage awards stand. On appeal, appellant argued the equitable offsets were improper; respondent argued that punitive damages were not warranted. The supreme court affirmed in part, holding that respondent acted maliciously or with a conscious disregard of appellant's interests, warranting punitive damages. The court reversed and remanded for reinstatement of the compensatory damages, and for additur, because the trial court improperly allowed consideration of restitution by a third party. The court overruled Bader v. Cerri, 96 Nev. 352 (1980), to the extent it would allow admission of such evidence in mitigation of non-consequential damages.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, injured when the taxi he was driving collided with a taxi driven by respondent driver, sued. When the jury found for respondents, appellant, arguing denial of a mistrial was error, appealed. The court affirmed.  Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 616C.215(10) provided that in any trial of an action by an injured employee against a person other than his employer, the jury had to receive proof of the amount of all payments made by the insurer. Therefore, when the jury was informed that appellant received State Industrial Insurance System (SIIS) benefits, granting a mistrial was not required. Although respondents' references to SIIS payments were improper, they were not so egregious or numerous as to confuse the jury or affect its verdict. Appellant's two additional accidents created a factual question for the jury as to which of appellant's permanent injuries, if any, were caused by the accident in question. Since the jury received ample evidence to support a finding that appellant's permanent injuries were either non-existent or unrelated to his accident, and it was properly instructed on SIIS payments, its verdict was not clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant a mistrial even though respondent improperly made references concerning state insurance fund payments to appellant.

The statute did not violate: (1) the search warrant requirement because the state's interest in solving crimes outweighed both a convict's diminished expectation of privacy and the minimally intrusive nature of the test; (2) equal protection standards, because of a rational basis for requiring such a test, apprehension of repeat offenders; (3) due process standards because the test was routine and did not concern a fundamental right; (4) cruel and unusual punishment standards because the test was not barbarous and did not involve wanton physical punishment; and (5) overbreadth standards because the statute plainly limited the purpose of testing.</SPAN></P>

The lower court entered a civil judgment against him for failure to pay taxes on the drugs pursuant to Nevada's Tax on Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Appellant was later convicted in the lower court of one count of possession of a trafficking quantity of a controlled substance. Appellant sought review of his conviction on the grounds that it was impermissible successive punishment under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Const. amend. V. The court vacated appellant's conviction, but the United States Supreme Court vacated the court's decision and remanded. On remand, the court again vacated appellant's conviction. The Nevada legislature intended the CSA as essentially civil in nature. The tax, however, was the functional equivalent of a criminal prosecution.

The court overruled previous case law, and held that the appeal was not rendered moot by the fact that appellant had served his sentence because criminal convictions entail adverse collateral consequences. The prosecutor's allegedly improper comments addressed appellant's factual assertions as counsel, and thus the jury could not have necessarily considered them as being directed at appellant's failure to testify. A jury instruction listing a dangerous knife as a weapon under &sect; 202.350(1)(b) was plain error, but the error was harmless. The attendant circumstances unequivocally demonstrated that appellant had been carrying a common steak knife as a weapon.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the ordinance was validly enacted because sufficient written financial commitments supported the conclusion that respondent city had met the condition precedent. Curative legislation which ratified the actions of adopting the ordinance did not violate separation of powers principles contained in Nev. Const. art. III, &sect; 1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of the murder of the eight-month-old daughter of his live-in companion. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct on or provide verdict forms on second-degree murder. The court affirmed the conviction, finding that an enumerated murder, such as murder by child abuse, did not fall within the category of murder that could be reduced in degree by failure to prove intent or deliberation and premeditation. Because the sole agency of death proved in this case was &quot;child abuse,&quot; the offense was, by definition, first-degree murder. The court also concluded that the proofs before the jury were only consistent with a finding of either guilty of child-abuse murder or not guilty, thus the use of the involuntary manslaughter instruction without a conforming second-degree murder instruction was harmless error; in fact, the involuntary manslaughter instruction should not have been given.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">First-degree murder conviction affirmed because instruction on second-degree was not erroneously refused since an enumerated murder like child-abuse murder could not be reduced in degree, and because proofs were only consistent with finding on child-abuse murder, it was harmless error to give involuntary manslaughter instruction without companion second-degree instruction.</SPAN></P>
