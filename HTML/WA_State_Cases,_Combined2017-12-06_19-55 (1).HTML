The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by prohibiting defendant from having contact with his wife as a condition of his sentence because she was the mother of the two child victims of sexual abuse for which defendant was convicted, defendant attempted to induce her not to cooperate in his prosecution, and she testified against defendant. Defendant's criminal history included convictions for murder and for beating his wife. The court held that the order prohibiting contact did not violate defendant's fundamental right to marry because it was reasonably necessary to achieve a compelling state interest, namely protecting his wife and her daughters.</SPAN></P>

Judgment or order under review. Date filed: May 30, 2007. Honorable Michael S Spearman.<BR>City of Seattle v. Okeson, 137 Wn. App. 1051, 2007 Wash. App. LEXIS 1434 (2007)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff ratepayers brought an action against defendants city and public utility in the King County Superior Court (Washington), seeking to recover for hydrant payments they made for the preceding three years. The ratepayers also sought to enjoin newly raised city taxes on the utility, which had resulted in the utility's raising its rates. The trial court held that past hydrant payments were illegal taxes. The ratepayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For years, the utility paid for hydrants by charging its ratepayers a hydrant fee. After a court decision that a similar charge on streetlights was an illegal tax, the city began to pay for the hydrants out of its general fund. To make up the cost, the city raised taxes on the utility, which raised rates on ratepayers. The court held that the charge was a tax, not a fee, because the purpose of charging for hydrants was to increase revenue for the city and ratepayers paid the same cost whether they used hydrants or not. Because the city did not declare the charge to be a tax until 2005, the charge was unconstitutional under Wash. Const. art. VII, &sect; 5. The court held that the ratepayers were within the interest zone of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 80.04.440 and had standing to challenge the tax and rate increase, but that the city had complied with the constitution by explicitly stating it was taxing the utility, adopting the tax, and making the tax subject to referendum. The court held that the ratepayers were entitled to 12 percent interest on both the pre- and postjudgment award for the past illegal charges pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 4.56.110(4), 19.52.020, and 80.04.440.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's holdings that providing fire hydrants was a government responsibility for which a government must pay, that the city's tax on the utility was constitutional, and that a municipality must pay the city for hydrants within its boundary. The court reversed the trial court's award of only one percent interest on the past invalid hydrant fees, holding that the ratepayers were entitled to 12 percent interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Washington) affirming defendant's convictions of second degree rape and first degree burglary and his sentences including a statutory maximum of life in prison, a minimum term within the standard range, a community placement term on the burglary charge, and a mandatory life term of community custody on the rape charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's community custody sentence included conditions against possession of pornographic materials or sexual stimulus materials and against frequenting establishments that sold sexually explicit or erotic materials. Defendant objected to the conditions on the ground that there was no evidence to suggest that pornography played any part in his offenses. The trial court and the court of appeals rejected defendant's overbreadth claim. The court held that preenforcement vagueness challenges to conditions of community custody could be raised for the first time on appeal and that defendant's vagueness challenges, under Wash Const. art. 1, &sect; 3, were sufficiently ripe. The conditions prohibiting defendant from possessing pornographic materials or sexual stimulus were unconstitutionally vague. Any restrictions implicating defendant's First Amendment rights had to be clear and reasonably necessary to accomplish state needs and public order. Defendant did not establish that the condition barring him from frequenting businesses whose primary business pertained to sexually explicit or erotic material was vague because the term &quot;erotic materials&quot; in the condition was sufficiently definite.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the exceptional sentence imposed by the Whatcom County Superior Court (Washington) following his conviction for residential burglary, first-degree theft, two counts of first-degree possession of stolen property, second-degree possession of stolen property, unlawful possession of marijuana, and unlawful possession of a dangerous weapon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court imposed an exceptional sentence on the burglary offense and ordered that it was to run concurrently with the other convictions. In imposing sentence, the trial court remarked that an exception sentence was appropriate because defendant had committed multiple current offense, because his offender score was the highest the judge had ever seen, and because sentencing defendant within the standard range would result in five current offenses going unpunished. On review, the court held that the trial court properly imposed an exception sentence on the burglary count under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535(2)(c). Defendant, due to his current offenses and past criminal history, had a calculated offender score of 21. If a standard range sentence had been imposed, he would have received no punishment through confinement on any charge but the burglary conviction because the remaining offenses did not increase the standard sentence range he faced on the burglary count. As such, the record supported the trial court's conclusion that, given his high offender score, some of defendant's current offenses would have gone unpunished if a standard sentence range had been imposed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence imposed by the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Gary R. Tabor, Judge. Thurston County Superior Court (06-2-01384-8). Judgment Date: January 26, 2007.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Thurston County, Washington, granted respondents', Department of Health (DOH) and Kitsap County Health District (KCHD), motions for summary judgment and dismissing appellant American Legion Post's (Post) case with prejudice. The Post had sought to preclude KCHD and the DOH from prohibiting smoking in the Post. The Post appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Post argued that the Smoking in Public Places Act (Act), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 70.160, did not prohibit smoking in a private facility, such as the Post, that was also a place of employment. The supreme court determined that if a facility was a &quot;place of employment,&quot; regardless of whether it was a &quot;public place,&quot; smoking was prohibited. The exception for private facilities applied to the definition of a &quot;public place,&quot; not a &quot;place of employment&quot; and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 70.160.060 did not apply when a place did not meet the definition of a &quot;public place.&quot; The Post lacked representational standing and was precluded from asserting that the Act violated its members' liberty interests without due process of law. Prohibiting smoking in places of employment was rationally related to protecting the public health and the Act did not violate Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. As there was no privilege involved, the Act did not violate Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 or the Fourteenth Amendment. The Act overcame the Post's void-for-vagueness challenge. KCHD and DOH were prevailing parties and awarded costs and attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was convicted by a jury of two violent rapes.

The court remanded to the ISRB a denial of parole in 2002 because the ISRB abused its discretion by supporting it parolability decision with speculation and conjecture. In 2006, the ISRB conducted a new parole hearing and set forth in detail the reasons for the denial of parole. The court found that the burden rested with the prisoner to prove he was a fit subject for release. The prisoner failed to demonstrate his complete rehabilitation, and the ISRB did not abuse its discretion by adding 80 months to his minimum term.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, 15 public school teachers, sought to enjoin respondents, their respective school districts, from releasing their names in response to a request from respondent/intervenor, a newspaper, for names of teachers accused of sexual misconduct against students. The Washington Court of Appeals ordered disclosure unless the allegations of misconduct were patently false. Three teachers appealed. The newspaper cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Allegations of sexual abuse of children by school teachers needed to be thoroughly investigated by school districts and, if the allegations were substantiated, the media could request records containing the identity of the perpetrating teacher. However, when such allegations were determined to be unsubstantiated, the identity of the teacher was exempt from disclosure to a public records request because such disclosure would have violated the teacher's right to privacy. Thus, the identities of public school teachers who were subjects of unsubstantiated allegations of sexual misconduct were exempt from disclosure under Washington's public disclosure act (PDA), former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.17.255 (1992), amended and recodified as Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.56.050 (2005). Letters of direction to teachers could be released to the public, but where a letter simply sought to guide a teacher's future conduct, did not identify an incident of substantiated misconduct, and the teacher was not subject to any form of restriction or discipline, the name of the teacher and other identifying information had to be redacted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion for discretionary review of the decision of the Skagit County Superior Court (Washington), which reversed an order of suppression from a district court and which upheld defendant's arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer pulled over the car in which defendant was a passenger. After detecting a moderate smell of marijuana coming from the car, the officer arrested defendant and the driver. Thereafter a search of defendant was conducted yielding a marijuana pipe containing a small amount of marijuana.  Upon review the court determined that Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 protected individual privacy, meaning that individuals were free from unnecessary police intrusion into their private affairs unless a police officer could clearly associate a crime with the individual. Unless there was specific evidence pinpointing a crime on a person, that person had a right to his own privacy and constitutional protection against police searches and seizures. The court held that the smell of marijuana in the general area where defendant was located was insufficient, without more, to support probable cause for arrest. Where no other evidence existed linking defendant, as a passenger, to any criminal activity, an arrest of defendant on the suspicion of possession of illegal substances, and any subsequent searches, was invalid and an unconstitutional invasion of that defendant's right to privacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Washington Court of Appeals that confirmed his convictions of unlawful delivery of a controlled substance in violation of former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.401(a)(1)(i), involving a minor in an unlawful drug transaction in violation of former &sect; 69.50.401(f) (1998), recodified as Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.4015, and possession with intent to deliver in violation of former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.401(a)(1)(i).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that insufficient evidence supported the convictions of involving a minor and that the imposition of an exceptional sentence based on judge-made findings violated his constitutional right to a jury trial. While the court affirmed defendant's convictions for possession with intent to deliver and unlawful delivery, it ruled that the evidence was insufficient to convict defendant of involving a minor in a drug transaction. The evidence showed only that defendant's stepdaughter was present when he engaged in drug transactions. Allowing a minor to remain present during a drug transaction was not prohibited by former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.401(f) (1998), recodified as Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.4015. The statute required evidence that defendant committed some act, directed at the minor, to bring or attempt to bring the minor into the transaction. Further, the trial court erred in imposing an exceptional sentence because the trial court, not the jury, made the factual determination that an aggravating factor existed in finding that the offenses committed were major violations of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 60.50.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction of two counts of involving a minor in an unlawful drug transaction was reversed. Defendant's sentence was also reversed, and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Based on the jury's response to a special interrogatory, the trial court imposed an exceptional sentence. The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed. Defendant petitioned for discretionary review on the exceptional sentence issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State alleged that the crimes against a minor victim were aggravated by her &quot;particular vulnerability.&quot; Under then-applicable provisions of the Washington Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 (SRA), the trial court was required to find the existence of an aggravating factor. The trial court submitted the aggravating factor to the jury by special interrogatory rather than make the factual determination itself. The instant court concluded that the jury's response to the special interrogatory was void and could not support defendant's exceptional sentence because the trial court exceeded its authority by delegating its factfinding duty to the jury. At the time defendant was tried, the SRA required the trial court, not the jury, to find the existence of the statutory aggravating factor at issue, according to the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof. The trial court could neither delegate its factfinding duty to the jury, nor impose a more demanding standard of proof. Even though the jury expressly found, beyond a reasonable doubt, the victim was &quot;particularly vulnerable,&quot; that finding could not support the imposition of an exceptional sentence under then-existing law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by information with second degree assault with a deadly weapon pursuant to former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.125 (1983) and former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.310 (1999). The trial court (Washington) imposed a 36-month firearm enhancement. After appeals, the U.S. Supreme Court remanded to the court to consider whether the failure to submit the firearm sentencing factor to the jury was subject to harmless error analysis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The firearm enhancement was three mandatory years, while a deadly weapon enhancement was one mandatory year, pursuant to former Wash. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 9.94A.310(3)(b), (4)(b), recodified as Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.510. The information charged defendant with second degree assault &quot;with a deadly weapon, to-wit: a handgun.&quot; At trial, the jury returned a special verdict form finding that defendant was armed with a deadly weapon. The information did not contain an allegation that a firearm enhancement applied, nor did the jury return a special verdict concluding that defendant was armed with a firearm. Defendant argued that the 36-month firearm enhancement violated his Sixth Amendment rights; only a 12-month deadly weapon enhancement was appropriate because the firearm issue had not been submitted to the jury. The court found that the trial court lacked authority under Apprendi to sentence defendant for an enhancement that was not charged nor found by the jury. Further, defendant lacked any notice that he could be sentenced under the firearm enhancement. The court held that harmless error analysis could not be applied to this error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the firearm sentence enhancement and remanded the case for correction of the sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that an independent state constitutional analysis of the right to refuse artificial means of nutrition and hydration was warranted under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. However, the State's interests in applying DOC's force-feeding policy to the inmate outweighed his right to refuse artificial means of nutrition and hydration. The State had a compelling interest in maintaining security and orderly administration in its prison system. DOC's force-feeding policy as applied to the inmate promoted the State's mandate to provide basic medical services to prisoners. Allowing the inmate to disrupt the policy was inimical to the State's interest in orderly prison administration. The inmate did not suffer from a terminal condition and application of DOC's force-feeding policy did not merely temporarily relieve a chronic condition but restored the inmate to a naturally healthy condition. The State had a compelling interest in preventing suicide. Death resulting from the inmate's refusal of artificial means of nutrition and hydration would consummate his intent to die. Under these circumstances, the State had a compelling interest in preventing the inmate's intentional death.</SPAN></P>

The sentencing court imposed an exceptional sentence of 366 months.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In order to obtain relief on his PRP, the inmate had to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he was actually and substantially prejudiced by a violation of his constitutional rights.

The supreme court had to consider whether the failure to submit a sentencing factor to the jury could be a harmless error. The supreme court found that the legislature's explicit assignment of the finding to the trial court precluded assigning the finding to the jury. It would have been procedurally impossible to obtain a constitutionally valid jury finding. Where the legislature directed that the court, not the jury, would make a finding, and established that the standard of proof shall be a preponderance of the evidence, rather than beyond a reasonable doubt, the quantum of evidence introduced to support the finding was immaterial--the error could not be harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9A.72.010(1) was unconstitutional insofar as it required the judge to determine the materiality of a false statement as a matter of law in a perjury prosecution. The State's argument that the statutory language did not prohibit a jury from determining materiality, but merely required a judge to determine materiality as well, was rejected as it was contrary to the statute's literal language that the judge was to determine materiality as a matter of law. There was no set of circumstances under which a judge could constitutionally apply a statute that required a judge alone to determine the materiality of a false statement as a matter of law. Such a procedure violated defendant's right to a jury trial on every element of the crime with which he was charged, a right that is specifically declared inviolate under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 21. The remainder of the perjury statute was upheld by severing and striking the offending language as directed by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.04.010(4).

A Washington superior court ruled that the district's random drug testing, without any individualized suspicion, was constitutional and granted summary judgment in favor of the district.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the district's policy of conducting random and suspicionless drug testing of student athletes was unconstitutional and violated student athletes' rights under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. Although the district asked the court to adopt a &quot;special needs&quot; exception to the warrant requirement to allow drug testing of student athletes, the court declined to recognize such an exception. The court's state constitutional analysis hinged on whether a search had authority of law--in other words, a warrant. A student athlete had a genuine and fundamental privacy interest in controlling his or her own bodily functions. Although the urinalysis test was by itself relatively unobtrusive, a student was still required to provide his or her bodily fluids. Even if done in an enclosed stall, this was a significant intrusion on a student's fundamental right of privacy. The court could not countenance random searches of student athletes with its jurisprudence regarding Wash. Const. art. I , &sect; 7. No argument was presented that would bring the random drug testing of student athletes within any reasonable interpretation of the constitutionally required authority of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Washington superior court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents, city, Seattle Public Utilities (SPU), and SPU director, on petitioner's, waste collection company owner, claim, finding that hauling solid waste within the city was not a fundamental right. The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed, reiterating that a city had broad discretion to take action under its police powers. The owner petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner argued that by granting contracts exclusively to two companies, the city violated Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. The supreme court found that because the power to regulate solid waste collection was with the legislature and local governments, the owner had no fundamental right of citizenship to provide this governmental service. The city's decision not to contract with illegally operating businesses was not unreasonable. The city was concerned with the health and safety implications of waste management. The city determined to limit the number of contractors so that it could establish uniform delivery standards, while at the same time promoting competition. The city did not infringe upon respondent contractor's right to freely alienate his property as he was required to employee the services of the two companies only if he chose not to haul the debris himself. The provisions of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.21.156 did not apply to the companies. The city did not exceed its authority when it chose to contract solely with the two companies. The court of appeals acted within its discretion when it refused sanctions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court affirmatively misled him when it failed to check the appropriate section of the order. Defendant argued that since former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.047(1) mandated notification, violation of the statute required a remedy. The supreme court found that, by failing to check the appropriate paragraph in the order, the predicate offense court not only failed to give written notice as required by the statute, but affirmatively represented to defendant that those paragraphs did not apply to him. There was no onerous burden placed on the State to provide notice. At the time of the disposition hearing, defendant had just turned 15 years old. It was reasonable to believe a person of that age would not necessarily know the degrees of crimes or how their crime might impair their rights. Any person in defendant's position would rely on the representations of the court.</SPAN></P>

The rule stated that indiscriminate posting created &quot;a negative appearance,&quot; and the authority claimed that some displays had been creating hostility among residents. The supreme court agreed with the tenants' council that the rule violated the tenants' rights under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment because: (1) the tenants retained control and dominion over the outer surfaces of their doors; (2) like an ordinance in City of Ladue v.Gilleo--a U.S. Supreme Court case which held that a city's residential sign ordinance violated First Amendment rights--the rule banned too much speech, as a total ban on signs was unnecessary to support the authority's claimed interests in avoiding the cost of refinishing damaged doors, reducing clutter, or avoiding conflict between residents; and (3) Gilleo made no distinctions between privately-owned residences and publicly-owned surfaces leased as part of a residence to a private tenant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was convicted of first degree child molestation and sentenced to a term of confinement of 60 months to life. The attorney had molested a former client, who at the time was 11 years old. The attorney violated Wash. R. Prof. Conduct 8.4(b) and (i). The court concluded that while the appropriate presumptive sanction for the attorney's violation of Rule 8.4(b) was suspension under the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Discipline, the hearing officer did not err by deviating to disbarment based on the attorney's abuse of the victim and the victim's mother's trust. The ABA Standards were not applicable in determining the appropriate presumptive sanction for violations of Rule 8.4(i) involving acts of moral turpitude. The appropriate presumptive sanction under Rule 8.4(i) for conviction of a Class A felony involving an act of moral turpitude was disbarment based on Washington case law. Although the hearing officer erred in finding that the aggravating factor of dishonest or selfish motive did not apply, he did not err in his conclusions regarding the remaining factors. The sanction of disbarment was not disproportionate when compared to other cases similarly situated.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals of Washington affirmed the verdicts, rejecting the city's constitutional challenges to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.26.281. The city appealed. The cases were consolidated for appellate review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.96.010 waived the city's sovereign immunity for suits under the Washington Law Enforcement Officers' and Fire Fighters' Retirement System Act (LEOFF), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 41.26. Allowing LEOFF members to sue their employer for negligent or intentional harm did not create a new municipal duty not otherwise existing for private parties. The city lacked standing to argue that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.26.281 violated Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, because the constitutional provision did not apply to municipal corporations. The firefighter trainee was entitled to sue under Wash. Rev. Code 41.26.281 where the evidence showed that he had passed the firefighter examination, accepted an offer of employment, enrolled in the LEOFF plan, and received a letter confirming that he was a member of the plan. Thus, he was serving in a position that required passing a civil service examination for firefighter within the meaning of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.26.030(4)(a). The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the city's motion for a new trial or remittitur as the evidence showed that the firefighter trainee's permanent injuries would have required continued treatment.</SPAN></P>

The parties separated and the father filed for dissolution of the marriage. The father was represented throughout the proceedings by private counsel. While the mother had counsel for part of the proceedings, at trial she was unrepresented and proceeded pro se. At the trial's conclusion, the superior court entered a parenting plan granting primary residential care of the children to the father. The plan granted the mother visitation rights. The mother then obtained assistance of counsel and filed a motion for a new trial, a motion that the superior court denied. The mother claimed her fundamental parental liberty interest was at stake in the dissolution proceeding, and the order of the superior court deprived her of the care, custody, companionship, and control of her children. The reviewing court held that fundamental constitutional rights were not implicated in a dissolution proceeding. The outcome of a dissolution proceeding could not be equated with a dependency or termination proceeding. Also, Wash. Const. art.

On his petition for review, the court held that counsel was not ineffective for allegedly failing to conduct a competent investigation into the inmate's mental deficiencies before entering a guilty plea because: (1) counsel's team did an in-depth investigation in preparation of a mitigation report; (2) there was no indication that the inmate was incompetent, insane, or under the influence of any condition that would have diminished his capacity; (3) from the time he surrendered to authorities, the inmate was determined to take responsibility for his actions and plead guilty; and (4) counsel's strategy was to rely on the inmate's remorse and willingness to take responsibility, which would have been undermined by an attempt to diminish his culpability by presenting mental health experts. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to negotiate a plea bargain with the prosecutor because the inmate failed to show that, but for counsel's failure, there was a reasonable probability that the prosecutor would have agreed to a reduction in the number of aggravators or that he would not have pleaded guilty and gone to trial.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 56, &sect; 7(6), being a constitutionally valid enactment, was effective in establishing the fiscal year 2006 state expenditure limit. Because the ESHB 2314 taxes did not generate revenues in excess of the fiscal year 2006 expenditure limit as established, the interest group's challenge failed. The court found no basis on which to invalidate the 2006 amendment to former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.135.025. The 2006 amendment was a valid exercise of the legislature's plenary power to enact laws. While the 2006 amendment operated retroactively, it did so within the limitations placed on retroactive statutes and without raising a separation of powers issue. It was neither the prerogative nor the function of the court to substitute its judgment for that of the legislature in enacting laws unless those laws clearly contravened state or federal constitutional provisions. Because the taxes enacted in ESHB 2314 parts I and II did not generate general fund revenues in excess of the fiscal year 2006 expenditure limit thus established, the interest group's challenge failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The King County Superior Court, Washington, granted judgment in favor of respondents, three nonprofit corporations and Whitman County, by holding that an initiative, I-747, violated Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 37 because the text of I-747 told voters that they were reducing the general property tax levy increase cap from two percent to one percent rather than from six percent to one percent. Appellant State sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that the text of I-747 led voters to believe that it would generally reduce the property tax increase limit from two percent to one percent. In fact, the initiative generally reduced the property tax increase limit from six percent to one percent. The State argued that the purpose of Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 37 was satisfied because the Voter's Pamphlet made it clear that there was an ongoing challenge to the validity of I-722, and if that law were struck down, I-747 would have the impact of reducing the property tax increase limit from the lesser of six percent or inflation to the lesser of one percent or inflation for most districts. The supreme court found that the text of the initiative misled voters about the substantive impact of the initiative on existing law. The parties were correct to conclude I-747 was amendatory in character and thus art. II, &sect; 37 was applicable. I-747 violated Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 37 because a voter reading the initiative could believe that he or she was voting to reduce the property tax limit by one percent instead of by five percent.</SPAN></P>

The property owners sought a declaratory judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment for property owners.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city adopted moratoria that imposed a freeze on private property development in shoreline areas. At the heart of the suit was the construction of structures that was designed to protect the property owners' property along the shoreline. In their complaint, the property owners argued that the moratoria (1) was invalid under Wash. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11 because the moratoria conflicted with the state laws, specifically, with the with Shoreline Management Act of 1971, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 90.58; (2) was invalid because the moratoria exceeded the scope of the City's statutory authority under Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect;&nbsp;35A.63.220 and 36.70A.390; (3) was invalid because impermissible purposes; and (4) was invalid because the City's Shoreline Master Program (SMP) was amended. The enactment of the city ordinances in this case was a clear violation of the property owners' rights. Local government had limited power over shorelines. The supreme court concluded that there was no statutory authority for the moratoria. The local goverment's usurpation of power violated Wash. Const. art. XVII, &sect; 1. The city did not have police powers to adopt the moratoria under Wash. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed both the trial court and the unanimous intermediate appellate court's decision invalidating the ordinances.</SPAN></P>

For constitutional purposes, this was a civil infraction, not a traffic infraction. As such, there was no ground for a Terry stop and, it followed, there was no ground for a Terry frisk.

The PDC and its members sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.17.530(1)(a) was unconstitutional on its face. The interest asserted by the legislature--protecting political candidates (including themselves)--was not a compelling interest in support of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.17.530(1)(a). Moreover, even assuming that protection of political candidates could have been a compelling interest, there was no requirement that the prohibited statements tended to be harmful to a candidate's reputation, i.e., defamatory. Thus, the statute was not narrowly tailored to serve the State's asserted interest in protecting candidates. Additionally, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.17.530(1)(a)'s exemption for candidates' false speech about themselves demonstrated that the statute was not narrowly tailored to serve the State's alleged interest in preserving the integrity of elections. Further, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.17.530(1)(a) was also fatally flawed due to its enforcement procedures, which were likely to have a chilling effect on speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for taking pictures of children playing in his neighbors' fenced backyards that he had saved on his computer. On appeal, the court held that the second search warrant, resulting in the seizure of the photographs supporting defendant's convictions, violated the Fourth Amendment's requirement for particularity. Accordingly, the evidence seized pursuant to that warrant had to be suppressed, and defendant's convictions for voyeurism were reversed. The search warrant authorized seizure of any evidence supporting the suspected criminal activity of narcotics/child sex. The fictitious crime of child sex was broader and more ambiguous than the term &quot;child pornography,&quot; and consequently the warrant allowed an officer unbridled discretion to decide what things to seize and permitted the seizure of items that may have been protected under the First Amendment, such as pornographic drawings of children.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was a serial killer, murdered two prostitutes in Pierce County. Pursuant to a plea agreement reached in Spokane County, defendant pleaded guilty to 13 counts of first degree murder (10 in Spokane County, 2 in Walla Walla County, and 1 in Skagit County) and 1 count of attempted first degree murder in Spokane County. In exchange, the Spokane County prosecutor agreed not to seek the death penalty. The court concluded that Pierce County was not precluded from seeking the death penalty for the two murders that defendant committed in Pierce County. The trial judge properly rejected defendant's equitable estoppel argument. The record contained no evidence that Pierce County ever promised defendant that it would forebear seeking the death penalty, nor did the record establish that Pierce County authorized the Spokane County prosecutor to include the Pierce County murders in a plea agreement eliminating the death penalty. Any rational trier of fact could have found that the Pierce County murders were part of a common scheme or plan. Defendant's sentence of death was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed, considering both the crime and the defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a drug transaction, the inmate took marijuana from a victim at gunpoint, forced the victim inside of a duffle bag after tying his hands and feet with wire, transported the victim to a river, and threw him inside. The inmate was convicted of first degree kidnapping while armed with a deadly weapon and attempted first degree murder. The convictions were affirmed on appeal, but the inmate sought relief from a personal restraint petition. In dismissing, the supreme court used the &quot;same evidence&quot; test. The test required further refinement in cases where one crime was an attempt. The supreme court was required to examine the actual facts constituting the &quot;substantial step&quot; under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.28.020(1) to see if the inmate's double jeopardy rights had been violated. Because the charging instrument did not identify the facts comprising the element of &quot;substantial step,&quot; the inmate argued that the trier of fact relied on the facts tending to prove both crimes. The fact that the victim was thrown into the river was not necessary to the proof of kidnapping.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed a trial court's finding in favor of respondent city, which held that Pasco, Wash., Ordinance 3231 did not violate Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that the city ordinance required a landlord to submit a certificate of inspection, but it did not authorize the city itself to search for housing violations. If a private inspector found code violations, the ordinance did not require the inspector to turn over the findings to the city. A landlord could remedy any violations found by an independent inspector, submit to another inspection, and obtain a license based on the new inspection, without the city ever being notified of the original violations. The landlords and tenants did not show that landlords and the privately engaged inspectors were state actors. Neither the Fourth Amendment nor Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 was violated. The inspection required by Pasco, Wash., Ordinance 3231 did not exceed what was already allowed by the Washington Residential Landlord Tenant Act of 1973. The language of the ordinance was not so vague that an ordinary person would not understand its meaning. Arbitrary discretion was limited by the standards set forth in relevant housing codes and regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The definition of political committee in former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.17.020(33) (amended 2005) was not unconstitutionally vague as a person of ordinary intelligence would have had a reasonable opportunity to understand the meaning of the phrase &quot;in support of, or opposition to, any candidate.&quot; The committee met the definition of a political committee because its advertisements had contemporary significance only with respect to the target's candidacy for political office and was clearly in opposition to that candidacy. As a result, the PDC did not unconstitutionally infringe on the committee's free speech rights by seeking to compel it to register as a political committee and to disclose its contributions and expenditures. Because the regulation at issue was not vague, the appellate court did not need to reach the issue of whether the trial court correctly applied the distinction between express advocacy and issue advocacy. Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 5, did not provide greater protection against disclosure requirements than did the First Amendment as neither constitutional history nor preexisting state law proved an intention to protect against disclosure requirements.</SPAN></P>

The King County Superior Court (Washington) granted summary judgment for the Secretary and dismissed appellants' action for injunctive and declaratory relief, holding that the initiative was not properly subject to preelection review. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged only the initiative's voter and legislative approval requirements relating to tax increases, which would make the act of &quot;raising taxes&quot; subject to Wash. Rev. Code 43.135.035(1) and (2)(a). The initiative also would make all tax increases potentially subject to referendum by providing that, pursuant to Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 1(b), tax increases could be referred to the voters for their approval or rejection at an election. At issue was whether the court should review the validity of the challenged provisions of I-960 prior to the November 2007 general election. Appellants first argued that the initiative's referendum provisions exceeded the people's legislative power because they would effectively alter the state constitution's referendum process without complying with the procedures for amending the constitution. Appellants also challenged the super-majority requirement of I-960. The court found that neither challenge was subject to preelection review. I-960 did not purport to amend the constitution, whatever its practical &quot;effect&quot; might be. Prior to election, the court would not entertain an argument that the initiative would be unconstitutional if enacted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the burden of proof instruction given, commonly referred to as the Castle instruction, violated his constitutional right to due process by diminishing the State's burden of proof. The court concluded that the Castle instruction given in defendant's case satisfied the minimum requirements of due process. The State was not relieved of its burden to prove every element of the charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the court also exercised its inherent supervisory authority to instruct Washington trial courts not to use the Castle instruction. Although the Castle instruction was constitutionally adequate, the court did not endorse it, finding the instruction to be problematic. The Castle instruction emphasized what the State need not prove instead of describing the State's burden of proof. The Castle instruction did not enhance the clarity of the reasonable doubt instructions. Until a better instruction was approved, the court instructed Washington trial courts to use Wash. Pattern Instructions Crim. No. 4.01 to inform the jury of the government's burden to prove every element of the charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a judgment was rendered holding that respondent Washington State Patrol's (WSP) mandatory vehicle impoundment policy exceeded statutory authority, appellant vehicle owner brought a class action suit against the WSP seeking damages based upon the alleged wrongful impoundment of vehicles. The WSP's motion for summary judgment was granted. The owner appealed, and the Washington Court of Appeals certified the case for further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's class consisted of all owners cited for driving while license suspended whose vehicles were impounded by the WSP under the mandatory impoundment policy of Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 204-96-010, a policy that had recently been determined to exceed statutory authority. Applying Restatement (Second) of Torts &sect; 265 (1977), the trial court found that the officers had authority to impound and that the manner in which they exercised that authority was reasonable. On review, the supreme court held that the privilege under &sect; 265 was not applicable as it applied only to cases involving the reasonableness of acts by individuals. Here, the owner was not alleging that the harm resulted from the conduct of any individual officer, but rather from a WSP directive that unlawfully required impoundment and eliminated individual discretion. Thus, the WSP's argument regarding the reasonableness of WSP officers' actions was not controlling. The WSP could not shield itself from liability for its policies based on a privilege that applied only to individuals and presumed authority to act. As such, the WSP could possibly be liable for conversion, and the summary judgment in its favor was improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's summary judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it allowed spectators to wear buttons bearing the victim's in-life picture for a portion of the trial. The buttons were not inherently prejudicial, and defendant failed to show that he was actually prejudiced, and therefore he was not denied a fair trial. The buttons had no words and portrayed an ambiguous message that would be reasonably understood as a show of sympathy and support for the victim's family. The buttons were removed after the third day of trial, both in-life and crime scene photographs of the victim were admitted during the trial, and defendant did not move for a mistrial or a curative jury instruction. The court rejected defendant's contention that the murder charge should be dismissed on the ground that the State failed to disclose allegedly exculpatory dog tracking evidence because there was no Brady violation, as the State disclosed all of the information it had, namely a report showing that the dog track was done.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the blank verdict question regarding the single act aggravating factor in his first trial constituted an implied acquittal that precluded the State's second prosecution. The first jury had sentenced defendant to death. Thus, the State could have sought the death penalty on retrial. The jury's failure to find the existence of an aggravating factor did not constitute an acquittal of that factor for double jeopardy purposes. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting an unavailable witness's prior testimony where defendant had the opportunity and similar motive to cross-examine him during the first trial. Any alleged error that occurred when the trial court did not allow defendant's attorney to cross-examine the State's experts with learned treatises was harmless where defendant failed to describe how the testimony would have affected the outcome. Review of the trial court's decision to exclude impeachment evidence was not possible where the trial court had sealed the letter and there was no request to unseal it. The trial court's error in admitting one murder victim's hearsay statement was harmless where it actually supported defendant's theory.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 49.46.010 in 1989, amended the Minimum Wage Act by replacing an exemption for domestic service providers with an exemption limited to individuals employed in casual labor. Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19 required that the subject of a bill be expressed in the title. However, the court observed that a challenge to the validity of a statute under Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 was precluded where the statute was subsequently reenacted or amended pursuant to properly titled legislation. In the case at hand, the legislature had amended &sect; 49.46.010 at least three times since 1989 and each time, the legislature had maintained the casual labor exclusion. The employers did not challenge the titles of these later amendments and so they were to be presumed constitutional. These amendments cured any defects in the 1989 amendment process.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found that the actual value of the truck was not relevant to the measure of value of the stolen property. The cashiers check defendants obtained was the &quot;property of another&quot; they intended to obtain by aid of deception, and its value exceeded $1,500. In deception cases, Wash. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner ratepayers sued respondent cities, alleging that a contractual provision under which an electric company agreed to pay a percentage of revenues received from the cities' power customers in exchange for promises to forbear from establishing their own municipal electric utilities violated Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.21.860(1). The Washington trial court granted the cities summary judgment and dismissed the action. The ratepayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principal issue in the case was whether the electric company's contractual agreement to pay the cities six percent of its revenues from the cities' utility customers was prohibited by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.21.860(1). Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.21.860 prohibited a municipality from imposing a franchise fee or any other fee or charge of whatever nature or description on an electric utility. The electric company's agreement to pay the cities a percentage of utility revenues the company received from the cities' residents did not fall within the statutory prohibition because the cities did not impose the payment provision in exercising their governmental powers of taxation and regulation. Rather, acting in a proprietary capacity, the cities negotiated the payment provision as consideration for a special benefit conferred on the company independent from the privilege of operating a franchise. In other words, the payments constituted valid consideration in exchange for the cities' promise to forbear from entering into competition with the electric company.</SPAN></P>

The trial court agreed and held that the scheme was unconstitutional as to felons who, due to their financial status, were unable to pay their LFOs immediately. On appeal, the court disagreed, holding that Washington's disenfranchisement scheme did not violate the privileges and immunities clause of the Washington Constitution, Wash. Const. art.

The scheme did not violate the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. amend.

In 1998 the detainee stipulated to commitment as a sexually violent predator (SVP). In 2005, the detainee petitioned for an unconditional release trial. The reviewing court held that the detainee must show that he no longer satisfied the definition of an SVP and that this change has come about through continuing participation in treatment. The detainee's expert, an expert in the field of sex offender treatment, concluded that it was his opinion that to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that the detainee's condition had changed since his commitment in 1998 such that he no longer satisfied the definition of an SVP. The appellate court ruled that since the expert indicated the detainee no longer satisfied the definition of an SVP, and because he stated that this change was due to treatment, the detainee made the requisite prima facie showing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">?Authority of law&quot; was satisfied by a warrant, issued upon probable cause, established by sworn affidavit, that may have been based in whole or in part upon hearsay. However, nothing in the language of the provisions governing searches and seizures suggested a negligence standard had to be applied to misstatements or omissions in a warrant affidavit. Moreover, Washington courts consistently applied the federal Franks standard, requiring a showing of reckless or intentional misstatements or omission of material facts. Thus, the text of Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, preexisting state and decisional law, and the ex parte nature of the warrant process supported the conclusion that a search warrant was invalid only if the warrant affiant recklessly or intentionally made material misstatements or omissions. The prosecutor did not act recklessly during a second warrant application where she had reported what she knew of the informant during the first warrant application, which had taken place 24 hours earlier. The warrant was facially sufficient as additional facts and circumstances established the informant's reliability.</SPAN></P>

In neither case did the State argue that access to the images should have been denied; its claim was that defendants' attorneys were not entitled to copies of the evidence. The supreme court agreed with defendants and disagreed with the State, finding that the culpability of the acts depicted might have varied based on when the photos or films were taken, by whom, and what they actually displayed. Defense counsel had to consider these and other defenses in reviewing substantial quantities of evidence. Further, adequate representation required providing a &quot;mirror image&quot; of the computer hard drive and enabling consultation with computer experts.

The state supreme court found no privacy interest in voluntarily discarded saliva. The police conduct was not so outrageous or shocking as to warrant dismissing the case under Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 8.3(b). The evidence presented by the State was sufficient to prove defendant was guilty of second degree murder. Defendant made a valid waiver of his Miranda rights when he voluntarily spoke with police and later invoked his rights to end the questioning. It was not error to allow hearsay statements made by the decedent into evidence; the statements fell under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule. Defendant's confrontations rights were not violated with a detective made a passing reference to an out-of-court statement made by a witness who saw defendant pushing a cart with a large box in it in the area where the body was discovered.

The court held that the practice of randomly checking the names of guests in a motel registry for outstanding warrants without individualized or particularized suspicion violated defendant's rights under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. Although Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 19.48.020 required the motel to keep record of a guest's arrival and departure for one year, there was no indication that the statute was intended to require lodging records for law enforcement purposes. The evidence obtained from the motel's guest registry, which led officers to defendant's room, was obtained through unlawful means and should have been excluded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent county, along with other political subdivisions, sued appellant political action committee (PAC), alleging that the PAC violated the Washington Fair Campaign Practices Act (FCPA), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 42.17. A Washington trial court issued a preliminary injunction and dismissed the PAC's counterclaims, but denied the county's request for attorney fees. The PAC appealed. The county cross-appealed the denial of attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The central issue on appeal was whether the trial court erred in characterizing the on-air support of an initiative campaign by two radio talk-show hosts as a campaign contribution that had to be disclosed under the FCPA pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.17.090. The initiative would have repealed a statewide fuel tax approved by the legislature. The instant court concluded that the broadcasts at issue fell within the statutory media exemption under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.17.020(15)(b)(iv) because they aired during the content portion of a regularly scheduled radio program, for which the broadcaster did not normally require payment, on a radio station that was not controlled by a candidate or political committee. The station was exercising one of its core media functions in broadcasting the hosts' talk shows. The hosts' broadcasts supporting the initiative campaign fell within the media exemption, regardless of whether the hosts acted at the behest of the PAC or solicited votes and financial support for the initiative campaign. Because the media exemption applied, the trial court erred in ruling that the broadcasts were a contribution subject to disclosure under the FCPA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the trial court dismissed the PAC's counterclaims based on its incorrect legal conclusion that the radio broadcasts at issue were a contribution subject to regulation under the FCPA, the instant court reversed the trial court's dismissal order and remanded for further proceedings. The instant court affirmed the trial court's denial of attorney fees to the county.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the buyer summary judgment, found that the dealership improperly charged the tax, found that declaratory judgment was proper, and certified a class.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyer purchased a car from the dealership. After negotiating a final purchase price, the dealership added $ 79 for BO tax. The buyer argued that the dealership improperly charged this tax as an additional cost above the final price. The supreme court determined that the dealership improperly charged the BO tax on top of the final price because Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.04.500 prevented the dealership from directly imposing the BO tax on its customers since the tax was not a tax on customers, was a tax on business, and should have been part of the operating overhead. Section 82.04.500 did not violate the First Amendment, because the dealership could disclose or itemize costs associated with the purchased item. The buyer could seek a declaratory judgment pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 7.24, concerning his rights under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.04.500 because (1) he had standing since he paid the tax for the dealership and he suffered economic injury, (2) the case was a justiciable controversy, and (3) his restitution claim was a private right of action that allowed him to recover the amount improperly paid as BO tax.

Code &sect; 43.43.754, six defendants were ordered to submit to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sampling as a sentencing requirement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the compelled collection of DNA samples from convicted felons did not invade a recognized private affair under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The State established that DNA collection under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.43.754 was analogous to the routine collection of fingerprints, photographs, and other vital statistics from convicted felons in the context of state constitution privacy concerns. The constitutionality of fingerprinting convicted persons was unquestioned. The statute did not unconstitutionally authorize disturbance of an individual's bodily integrity by allowing the DNA results to be used for purposes other than identity. Defendants, as convicted felons, had only a minimal privacy interest in their identities. Because the statute narrowly defined its purpose as the production of identifying information and this type of information had traditionally not been recognized as a protected interest of convicted felons, there was no disturbance of defendants' private affairs under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The court also concluded that the compelled collection of DNA samples from convicted felons did not violate the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company did not directly sell to consumers in the cities. The company sold cars, automobile parts and accessories to independent dealers located within the cities. These dealers, in turn, sold to retail customers. The company also conducted a variety of business activities within the cities related to the sale of its cars, parts, and accessories to dealers. The cities assessed B&amp;O taxes on the grounds that the company was engaged in the business of making sales at wholesale. The supreme court found that the company admitted that it engaged in activities within the cities that were related to its business of making wholesale sales to dealers. Therefore, the company was properly classified and taxed as one engaging in the business of wholesaling within the cities. The cities properly limited their tax measure to only those sales that were connected to the company's business activities in their respective jurisdictions. There was no violation of the Commerce Clause because the cities imposed their B&amp;O wholesaling taxes equally upon interstate and intrastate business and made no distinction between them.</SPAN></P>

The cases raised the issue of whether a trial court allowed testimony of an investigating officer or examining doctor as supporting the victims' credibility; and, if so, whether the error was &quot;manifest&quot; constitutional error that could be raised for the first time on appeal under Wash. R. App. P. 2.5(a)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants alleged that their trials involved testimony opining on credibility, raising alleged errors of constitutional dimension (i.e., the right to a jury trial). However, opinion testimony relating indirectly to a victim's credibility, not objected to, did not give rise to such error. A doctor's statement that a child's account was &quot;clear and consistent&quot; did not constitute an opinion on credibility. Likewise, by testifying as to interview protocol, a detective provided context enabling the jury to assess the reasonableness of the child's responses. Detectives often used such protocol, regardless of whether they believed the child, and it did not carry a &quot;special aura of reliability&quot; beyond that conferred when the judge swore the child, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 5.28.020, to tell the truth. Also, where a doctor was asked to reconcile his negative findings with the victim's statement, he did not testify as to any ultimate fact; his testimony that the girl had good language skills was content neutral. Moreover, it appeared that counsel in both cases chose not to object for tactical reasons, and each jury received proper instructions as to their role as the trier of fact.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals of Washington, Division One, held that the drivers' activities did not involve participation in the incorporation of the delivered materials into the construction project. The Department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the end-dump truck drivers on the first phase of construction of an airport runway were entitled to be paid prevailing wages. The lower court erred in applying the canon of ejusdem generis to Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 296-127-018(2)(a) to limit the scope of the coverage of the prevailing wage act, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 39.12, to only those activities similar to spreading, leveling, or rolling. The lower court's application of the canon did not advance the legislature's intent in passing Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 39.12.020, produced the type of wage decrease the prevailing wage act was designed to prevent, and did not accord proper weight to the Department's interpretation of its regulation. Thus, the Department's broader construction of the governing regulation was correct and the drivers had participated in the incorporation of fill material into the project. However, because the Department's present position on the applicability of the prevailing wage act to the drivers' activities was inconsistent with the position it adopted in its 1992 policy memorandum and with subsequent representations it made to the suppliers, the Department was estopped from enforcing its order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged four defendants with nine counts of violating Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 40.16.030. A Washington trial court dismissed the charges against defendants, holding, as a matter of law, that the Washington Public Disclosure Act (PDA), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 42.17, provided the exclusive penalties for the conduct alleged by the State. The State appealed the dismissal of the charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State alleged that campaign contributions made by some individuals to three city council members during their reelection campaigns were reimbursed in cash by defendants, and that as a result of this scheme, the incumbents filed false campaign disclosure reports because they did not identify the true source of the contributions. The instant court concluded that the PDA did not bar prosecution of defendants under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 40.16.030. In dismissing the charges, the trial court erred in applying the &quot;general-specific&quot; rule of statutory interpretation. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.17.390 expressly stated that the civil remedies and sanctions in the PDA were in addition to any other remedies provided by law. Thus, the PDA expressly provided that any remedy available under any other statute could be imposed. The express acknowledgement in &sect; 42.17.390 that the remedies listed did not preclude &quot;any other remedies provided by law&quot; showed that the PDA was not intended to preclude a criminal action under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 40.16.030. There was no conflict between &sect; 40.16.030 and the PDA. Therefore, both could be given effect and harmonized.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court reversed the trial court's decision, reinstated the charges against defendants, and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a truck driver and his wife, sought review of a decision from a Washington Court of Appeals, which held that the truck driver was not entitled to overtime pay for work as an interstate truck driver because he did not work more than 40 hours a week within the state of Washington. The truck driver contended that such overtime pay was mandated by Washington's Minimum Wage Act (MWA), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 49.46.130(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The truck driver had prevailed before a trial court on his overtime claim, but that decision was reversed by a state appellate court, which held that the MWA did not count hours worked outside the state of Washington. On review, the court reversed because it found that the plain language of the statute made no distinction between the hours spent driving in state and those spent driving outside Washington, and that its holding was consistent with other related statutes. To the extent that the appellate court had relied on certain regulations for its ruling, the court noted that the regulations could not supersede the plain language of the statute. That is, the court gave no weight to rules defining hours for purposes of overtime provisions as hours worked within Washington's borders because those rules were not consistent with the plain language of the statutes being implemented, nor with the stated purposes of the MWA, nor with the principles that applied to interpretation of remedial legislation governing payment of wages in Washington state. The court also remanded for a new analysis of attorneys' fees, given its ruling, and an analysis of whether a multiplier was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment below and remanded to the trial court with directions to determine, in reference to attorneys' fees for the truck driver, whether a multiplier was appropriate, in light of the court's conclusion that the factors previously relied on did not support a reduction in the lodestar amount.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appellate court held that the couple's property was &quot;partially developed,&quot; and that former Lacey, Wash., Code &sect; 14.32.030 was not unconstitutionally vague. It held that &sect; 14.32.030 was clear and unambiguous. The state supreme court agreed but found it inapplicable. Under the term's plain meaning, the couple's property was &quot;developed&quot; as it was a lawful building site that was ready for sale or use. The city confused &quot;developed&quot; with &quot;improved.&quot; After land was developed, it could be improved. The city asserted that land was only developed when one could no longer improve it. But one could not build on or improve upon a lot unless it was developed. The couple could add to their improvements only because their lot was developed. The land was developed as no part was raw land needing further development to be suitable for sale or improvement; the city and the state appellate court read &quot;partially developed&quot; so broadly that it included nearly every piece of property. And, finally, even if the ordinance was ambiguous, the city's interpretation would not be entitled to deference as it failed to meet its burden that the interpretation was a matter of preexisting policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In four consolidated cases, review was issued to decide whether the Superior Courts of Pierce County, King County, and Spokane County, Washington, had the inherent authority to empanel a jury to determine whether an exceptional sentence should be imposed, and whether 2005 Wash. Laws ch. 68 applied to any of these cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court originally took review of these cases to decide whether juries in Washington could be asked to find facts that might justify an upwards departure from standard-range sentences. Shortly after the initial oral argument, the Washington Legislature enacted 2005 Wash. Laws ch. 68, amending the Sentencing Reform Act, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 9-94A, to explicitly give juries this responsibility. The supreme court found that 2005 Wash. Laws ch. 68 applied to all sentencing proceedings held since it was signed into law on April 15, 2005. Thus, the State could seek exceptional sentences against the third and fourth defendants, whether they ultimately plead guilty or went to trial, as they had neither pled guilty nor begun their trials prior to the signing of 2005 Wash. Laws ch. 68. However, since the first two defendant had each pled guilty prior to the signing of 2005 Wash. Laws ch. 68, the procedures set forth in the new enactment did not apply to them. Additionally, the supreme court found that it lacked the power to fashion a remedy to empanel juries, thus the State could not seek exceptional sentences against the first two defendants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State could seek exceptional sentences against the third and fourth defendants, the State could not seek exceptional sentences against the first two defendants, and Washington courts lacked inherent power to empanel sentencing juries outside of the new enactment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the municipal utility was allowed to mitigate the effects of its greenhouse gas emissions by paying public and private entities to reduce those entities' emissions. Combating global warming was a general government purpose, albeit a meritorious one, and not a proprietary utility purpose because, the offset contracts were not part of the services for which individual customers were billed. Rather, the offset contracts were charged to municipal utility customers regardless of how much electricity they used. The contracts also lacked the required nexus to the purpose of supplying electricity because although they were designed to clean up the utility's own emissions, they were also designed to benefit the public as a whole. Thus, the utility lacked authority under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.92.050 to use ratepayer money for the offset contracts because they were neither proprietary in nature nor sufficiently related to the purpose of supplying electricity. Therefore, such mitigation expenses had to be borne by general taxpayers rather than utility ratepayers.</SPAN></P>

While he was serving this sentence, the State sought an involuntary SVP commitment. The State presented evidence of the burglary and other sexually motivated crimes and incidents. After a commitment order was entered, the court of appeals affirmed. This appeal followed. In affirming, the supreme court determined that, because sexual motivation was established under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.020(15)(c), the State was not required to reprove the underlying facts comprising the burglary conviction. The Sixth Amendment right to confrontation did not apply because the detainee was not a criminal defendant. Given the myriad procedural safeguards surrounding such a proceeding, the detainee did not have a due process right to confront witnesses at his commitment trial or at depositions. In addition, the detainee's counsel did not render ineffective assistance at his commitment trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three different defendants' appeals were transferred from the Washington Court of Appeals, Division Two and consolidated to determine two issues common to all three defendants. First, whether there was independent evidence sufficient to corroborate defendants' incriminating statements to law enforcement officers under the corpus delicti rule. Second, whether there was sufficient evidence to support defendants' convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first defendant argued that the State produced no independent evidence to corroborate his statement to an officer that he was stealing the pseudoephedrine pills to sell to someone else who planned to manufacture methamphetamine. The supreme court agreed. The State presented evidence that petitioner stole somewhere between 15 and 30 packages of pills. That evidence was sufficient only to support the logical and reasonable inference that defendant intended to steal the pills. The mere assertion that the pills were known to be used to manufacture methamphetamine did not necessarily lead to the logical inference that defendant intended to do so, without more. Defendant told the officer that he was stealing the pills for someone else who was going to make methamphetamine, but the State had no independent evidence to support that statement other than the officer's bare assertion that the pills were used to manufacture methamphetamine. Absent defendant's statement that he intended to sell the pills to another person who was going to manufacture methamphetamine, the State's evidence only supported the inference that defendant intended to steal the pills.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state sought review of the decision of the Court of Appeals, Division One (Washington), that reversed defendants' sentences on the grounds that their status on community placement at the time of the current offense was a fact that had to, under decisions of Apprendi and Blakely, be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were on community placement at the time they committed their current offenses. Defendants argued that the sentencing court violated their Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial when the judges, rather than a jury, determined that they were on community placement at the time of the present crimes and used that determination to increase their standard range sentence. The supreme court found that unlike the criminal defendants in Blakely and Apprendi, neither defendant improperly received an exceptional sentence based on an aggravating fact relating to their current offense. Rather, under Washington law, a condition of a prior conviction and sentence served to increase their standard range sentence in the same way as the fact of their prior conviction did. The community placement status determination under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.525(17) (amended) related only to defendants' status as a recidivist and was readily established as a matter of law by a review of criminal history that incorporated constitutional safeguards. Therefore, the sentencing court's determination properly fell within the Almendarez-Torres prior conviction exception.</SPAN></P>

The instant court concluded that the inclusion of petitioner's juvenile adjudications in his offender score fell under the prior conviction exception in Apprendi v.

The lesser offense for double jeopardy purposes in this case was second degree attempted murder, not assault, because the attempted murder conviction was the offense that carried the lesser sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court was asked by petitioner to decide whether county ordinances enacted under detailed procedures established by the state Growth Management Act (GMA), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 36.70A, to designate and protect critical areas were subject to a veto by a local vote. Respondents, an advocacy group and a county, opposed allowing referenda to give local entities veto power over the GMA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a previous case, the court concluded that GMA ordinances, at least those relating to critical areas, were not subject to referenda. The court reached that decision due to the fact that the county was required by the state to designate and protect critical areas and that the state had established elaborate procedures for public participation that were inconsistent with local up and down votes. In the instant proceeding, the court had to determine whether the legislature intended to create broad state policy to be implemented by counties when it enacted the GMA or whether it simply intended to authorize municipalities to take some action. The court held that it was for the legislature to establish any additional role county voters should play in the GMA process or for the voters of the state to amend the GMA via a statewide process under Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 1. Viewed as a whole, the GMA contemplated that public participation would be channeled through its systems. If ordinances adopted pursuant to these state mandates were to be subject to local referenda, the state legislature had to include the procedure in the underlying statutory schema; it did not do so with the GMA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial judge. Attorney fees were denied, and the county's motion to strike petitioner's statement of additional authorities was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent local governments and others sued appellant State, challenging an initiative that reduced motor vehicle excise taxes. On remand, a trial court granted respondents summary judgment, finding that the initiative impaired the contract between bondholders and intervenor-respondent transit district. Intervenor-appellants, a homeowners association, an association member, and an initiative sponsor, appealed the grant of summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The initiative violated Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 23, as the bonds constituted a contract between the district and the bondholders. The initiative substantially impaired that contract by expressly withdrawing the district's ability to levy and collect the motor vehicle excise taxes, thereby reducing the bondholders' security without providing alternative or additional security. Moreover, the initiative was not justified as a reasonable and necessary exercise of the State's sovereign power as a change in tax policy was not a sufficient justification. The bond contract was valid as the district had been properly formed pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 81.112.030(8), that statute was properly enacted by the legislature, and delegation of taxing authority to the district was constitutional. In addition, the district's pledge of the tax revenues did not exceed its statutory authority under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 81.104.180. The intervenor's request to retire the bonds early was rejected as unconstitutional. The trial court did not err in refusing to award interest on the refund of license fees as the refund of fees was not a judgment and thus, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.56.110 did not apply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's grant of summary judgment and final order on the refund of vehicle license fees were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The jury in the murder case sentenced defendant to death. He appealed the convictions and sentences in both cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the trial court did not err in its evidentiary rulings in the rape case, the conviction was reversed because of an abuse of discretion by the trial court when it declined to review in camera the dependency files of the victim's child for evidence relevant to defendant's consent defense. The verdict in the rape case boiled down to whose version of the facts was more credible--the victim's or defendant's. The dependency files revealed information that could have led to admissible evidence that the victim engaged in prostitution activity similar to that claimed by defendant close to the time of the alleged sexual assault. Because the evidence was material to the defense, its nondisclosure was not harmless. There was no basis for reversal of the aggravated first degree murder conviction. However, the prosecutor engaged in misconduct during closing arguments in the penalty phase of the murder trial, painting a rosy picture of prison life, including images of defendant watching television and lifting weights, that, when juxtaposed against the images of the crime scene, could not have been cured by an instruction and thus provided a basis for reversal of the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rape conviction was reversed. The aggravated first degree murder conviction was affirmed, but the death sentence was reversed. The murder case was remanded to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's driver's license was suspended when he was stopped for driving under the influence and refused to take a breath test. While defendant was in custody at a rehabilitation facility, the Department of Licensing sent an order of revocation to his address of record. Defendant was subsequently arrested and convicted for driving with a revoked driver's license. The Washington Court of Appeals, Division One, denied review. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant argued that the Department committed reversible error when it revoked his driver's license without providing constitutionally sufficient notice. The State argued that it satisfied due process requirements because it followed the requirements for providing notice under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.65.065(1). The supreme court found that the State did not know that the notice sent to defendant's address of record was ineffective until after the revocation became operative. Moreover, because the rehabilitation facility was only a temporary detainment facility, the inquiry defendant sent asking for information about how he could have his license reinstated did not put the Department on notice that defendant would still be at the facility when it sent the order of revocation. In addition, by the time the State learned that defendant had not received the notice, defendant had already been released from the facility. Under these circumstances, the Department's failure to take additional steps to put defendant on notice was reasonable. The notice was reasonably calculated to provide defendant with notice of the pendency of his driver's license revocation.</SPAN></P>

The father's due process rights were not violated when the commissioner refused to allow testimony from and cross-examination of the complaining child at the hearing because cross-examination was unnecessary, as the commissioner had ample evidence with which to make his determination, including the father's admission that he rubbed aloe vera on his child's naked body.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that defendant entered into his plea agreement with the understanding that Washington's sentencing scheme permitted a trial judge to enact in fact finding, and if the judge found substantial and compelling reasons, he or she could impose an exceptional sentence beyond the standard range but not exceeding the maximum allowed by the statute. Defendant argued that he need not challenge the entire plea agreement to challenge his exceptional sentence. The supreme court found that Blakely did not apply to indeterminate minimum sentences under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.712 that did not exceed the maximum sentence imposed. The statutory maximum sentence was life in prison. Blakely did not apply to defendant's exceptional minimum sentence of 200 months for each offense because both sentences were less than the statutory maximum sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed defendant's conviction for theft in the second degree and theft in the first degree, holding that he did not make a showing that the plea bargains were divisible from the stipulations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that the court of appeals found defendant's stipulation to the real facts was an integral part of the plea agreement and was not shown to be divisible. However, whether the stipulation was divisible was irrelevant because defendant did not need to challenge his stipulation in order to establish that a Blakely violation occurred. Even assuming defendant's stipulation was valid, the trial court still engaged in improper Blakely fact finding when it found the crimes constituted a major economic offense. The trial court imposed an exceptional sentence of 30 months, well outside the standard range of three to nine months, based on its finding that defendant had committed a major economic offense. Defendant's sentence was in violation of Blakely because the exceptional sentence was predicated on an unstipulated fact that was not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to three counts of vehicular assault. He stipulated that the facts set forth in the certification for determination of probable cause and the prosecutor's summary were real and material facts for the purposes of sentencing. He did not agree that those facts formed a legal basis for an exceptional sentence. For the most severely injured victim, the trial court sentenced him to a 48-month exceptional sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Appeals (Washington) affirmed the exceptional sentence and concluded that the trial court properly found that the one victim who had been rendered paraplegic was particularly vulnerable. As her vulnerability was sufficient to support the exceptional sentence, the court of appeals did not address the sufficiency of the other reasons. Blakely was subsequently decided, and defendant moved for reconsideration. The court of appeals denied reconsideration. Defendant filed a petition for review and challenged the exceptional sentence, arguing that it violated the Sixth Amendment pursuant to Blakely because the jury did not find the necessary facts beyond a reasonable doubt. The Supreme Court of Washington recognized defendant's behavior was reprehensible. Yet even if the supreme court assumed for the sake of argument that defendant's stipulation was valid, the trial court had to make additional factual findings above and beyond the admitted facts in order to have supported an exceptional sentence based on victim vulnerability. Because those facts were not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, the exceptional sentence violated the Sixth Amendment under Blakely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded to the court of appeals for determination of whether the Blakely error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the validity of legislation, Wash. SHB 3055, relating to admissibility of breath or blood alcohol concentration tests in drunk driving cases. A Washington municipal court rejected all challenges to the legislation. Appellant, who was convicted of being a driver under 21 consuming alcohol, petitioned for direct review of the judgment pursuant to Wash. R. App. P. 4.3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued the legislation violated either the United States Constitution or the Washington Constitution by: (1) including more than one subject in its title (2) not including the subject of the bill in its title (3) violating the doctrine of separation of powers, and or (4) violating due process by creating a mandatory rebuttable presumption. The court concluded that the legislation's title stated explicitly that it was amending Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.506 and reenacting and amending Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 46.20.308 and 46.20.3101. The title adequately announced it was amending the Washington Motor Vehicle Act, and the subject matter of the legislation was within the Act's purview. Therefore, the legislation did not violate the single-subject rule or the subject-in-title rule of Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19. The legislation did not violate the separation of powers doctrine because the legislature was neither invading the prerogative of the courts nor was it threatening judicial independence. Regarding appellant's due process challenge, the court concluded that appellant did not show an impermissible or unconstitutional shifting of the evidentiary burden.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father claimed that he was denied procedural due process prior to the suspension because he was not given a meaningful hearing and that he had a fundamental economic right to pursue an occupation as a taxi driver and that suspension of his commercial drivers' license under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 74.20A.320 did not survive strict scrutiny. The supreme court found that &sect; 74.20A.320 provided a person with the opportunity for an administrative hearing in order to challenge the suspension. He could obtain a release of his suspension by signing a repayment agreement under Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 388-14A-4520. The father could have appealed the order that raised his child support payment and file a motion to modify support with the court. There was a rational relationship between professional license suspension and the State's interest in enforcing child support orders. The statute promoted the State's interest in encouraging legally responsible persons to financially support their children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised the following issues, inter alia, on appeal: (1) Whether the fugitive disentitlement doctrine precluded defendant's right to appeal when defendant absconded from the jurisdiction after conviction but before sentencing?

The state supreme court held that (1) the fugitive disentitlement doctrine generally did not apply to defendant who absconded after conviction but before sentencing, (2) the trial court's denial of the use of public funds to translate the Mexican extradition documents was not an abuse of discretion because defendant did not prove why it was necessary and defendant was being sentenced within the standard range, and (3) defendant's convictions did not violate his double jeopardy rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a decision of the Court of Appeals (Washington), which dismissed charges added after defendant withdrew his guilty plea. The case was also remanded for a determination of whether the trial court should dismiss any of the remaining charges as a deterrent to prosecutorial vindictiveness under Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 8.3(b). Defendant cross-appealed his convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with 16 counts of burglary, robbery, kidnapping, and assault. He pled guilty to one count of first degree kidnapping while armed with a deadly weapon and one count of second degree possession of a firearm. Defendant later withdrew his plea, and the State filed an amended information containing 15 additional counts. The Court of Appeals held that 10 of the kidnapping charges were incidental to the robberies as a matter of law. The State did not raise the merger issue under Wash. R. App. P. 13.7, 13.4(c)(5). The court reversed in part, and held that all of the charges, with the exception of unlawful possession of a firearm, were crimes against persons under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.440(2). The court also held that the additional charges related to crimes where defendant personally entered the invaded homes and hence was identifiable by nonparticipants in the crime. In the incident related to the original charges, defendant did not enter the homes. Also, the increased number and the consequent severity of the collective charges caused the discrepancy in the sentences, not prosecutorial vindictiveness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the 10 kidnapping counts that the court of appeals held were incidental to the robberies. The court reversed the dismissal of the counts related to prosecutorial vindictiveness, and upheld defendant's other convictions.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found that the trial court did not violate the SRA when it considered the effect that defendant's possible deportation had on his treatment and/or punishment. Defendant, an illegal alien, did not show how his treatment differed from treatment of others. He did not indicate whether his claim was based on different treatment as compared to a citizen or as compared to another alien, subject to deportation or not subject to deportation. The denial of defendant's request for a sentencing alternative out of concern that he would not be able to comply with the requirements of a SSOSA was rationally related to the SRA's goal of ensuring standardized sentencing and did not violate equal protection. Defendant did not meet his burden of showing that the trial court intentionally discriminated against him.</SPAN></P>

It was lawful under Oregon law to record a telephone conversation with one party's consent. Defendant did not have an expectation of privacy related to his behavior in Oregon and the resulting criminal investigation by Oregon police regarding his sexual misconduct while in Oregon. No Washington State law enforcement officer or official requested or in any way encouraged the making or recording of the calls. They were not unlawful under Wash. Rev.

Const. art.

The appellate court declined to stay the trial court's ruling and the election went forward. As a result, eight years later, no appellate court had reviewed the merits of the trial court's ruling. The City argued that the narrow issue of whether the initiative was beyond the scope of the initiative power granted to the residents of the City, an action it brought before the election was held, was not moot. The reviewing court held that the question of whether the initiative was beyond the scope of the initiative power was not mooted by the election because the election did not alter or expand the scope of the initiative power.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 49.60, forbade an employer from discharging an employee because of the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.60.180(2). The supreme court determined that a plaintiff bringing suit under the WLAD established that he had a disability if he had a physical or mental impairment that substantially limited one or more of his major life activities, a record of such an impairment, or was regarded as having such an impairment. This was consistent with the term &quot;disability&quot; as utilized by the legislature and the history underlying the WLAD and accorded closely with the definition of the same term &quot;disability&quot; in the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 12101-12209. The proposed definition would ensure that scarce judicial resources were available to those most in need of the WLAD's protections, rather than persons with receding hairlines. The trial court had to apply this definition to the employee's disparate treatment claim. Both parties prevailed on some issues. Neither party substantially prevailed, and the parties had to bear their own costs.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court agreed. Although the trial court referred to the actual detriment standard, the record reflected that it applied the &quot;best interests of the child&quot; standard. As a result, the trial court failed to accord the mother the benefit of the presumption that placement of the child with her, a fit parent, would be in the child's best interests and failed to place a heightened burden of proof upon the stepmother, a nonparent. Under the actual detriment standard, the trial court should have been focusing primarily on the effects on the child's long-term growth and development, should he be placed with his mother, and the burden should have been squarely placed on the stepmother. The test was not a balancing of all the aspects of each household and on the child's wishes; it was a focused test looking at actual detriment to the child if placed with an otherwise fit parent. Therefore, the trial court erred.</SPAN></P>

The Department petitioned for review on the question of whether the EAJA applied to court review of WISHA decisions. The supreme court found that the corporation did not present evidence to show that the violations involved different types of hazards. The Department properly determined that the employees were repeatedly exposed to the same type of hazard and thus subject to enhanced penalties. Because the statute specifically limited its applicability to judicial review and judicial review was generally limited to court review, the EAJA did not apply to administrative review before the Board.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court first concluded that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.68A.070 was unquestionably constitutional as it contained a &quot;knowingly&quot; scienter requirement and did not sweep within the First Amendment's protected speech. The critical focus was on defendant's criminal intent and not on the fact that no minors were actually subjected to sexual exploitation or abuse. As for defendant's contention that the trial court impermissibly based its guilty verdict on computer images that defendant had a constitutional right to possess, the supreme court concluded that such fact did not render the conviction unconstitutional. That the images defendant actually possessed may not have been minors did not mean that defendant could not be convicted of attempted possession of depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Finally, the supreme court held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction. Among other things, defendant's cautioning an individual to be careful because the individual was &quot;underage&quot; and defendant's requests for pictures of the individual's genitals were evidence of defendant's attempt to obtain pictures of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.</SPAN></P>

The father testified that he told the girl that he found two sexually threatening notes in the front yard that described her. Defendant did not dispute that he wrote the notes with the requisite predatory purpose of promoting a minor's exposure and involvement in sexual misconduct or that he left the notes in a location that the girl was likely to find them. The evidence was also sufficient to support defendant's conviction for writing a message on the underpants, even though the children who found them were too young to read the message, because defendant cited no authority suggesting that a victim must understand the sexual nature of the communication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence of controlled substances should be suppressed because the searches incident to their arrests were invalid under Wash.

The State argued that the arrests were valid because the police had probable cause to believe defendants had committed the crime of DWLS based on the Department of Licensing (DOL) records indicating their licenses were suspended. The supreme court noted that police needed probable cause to believe defendants had committed the crime of DWLS. Information from the DOL records provided officers with reasonably trustworthy information sufficient to establish probable cause to believe defendants' licenses were suspended. The subsequent invalidation of some of the license suspension procedures did not void the probable cause that existed to arrest petitioners for the crime of DWLS.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's mother lived with her boyfriend and daughter. One morning, the daughter called the police and told the police that defendant had just left after breaking into his mother's bedroom by kicking in the dead bolt locked door.

Defendant testified that he went into his mother's house to pick up clothes and accidentally broke the lock on the mother's bedroom door. The appellate court reversed the court of appeals and vacated defendant's conviction because it appeared to the appellate court that the trial judge applied a mandatory presumption under Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&nbsp;9A.52.040 to find defendant's intent was criminal because the trial judge stated that under &sect;&nbsp;9A.53.040 defendant's unlawful presence in the mother's bedroom allowed him to infer that defendant acted with criminal intent and that defendant had not rebutted that inference.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant resident challenged the decision of the Court of Appeals (Washington) upholding the trial court's antiharassment orders against the resident filed by respondent, housing project administrator on behalf of the project, which resulted from the resident placing newsletters on apartment doors, disruptive behavior and name-calling at resident meetings, and allegations of the resident listening at other residents' doors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge identified a number of the declarations of the staff and other residents alleging that the resident had yelled at the staff and residents, spied on them and frightened them. The order effectively evicted the resident from the project. The court held that the record contained substantial evidence relating to the resident's conduct, which had little or no free speech protections. His behavior in forcing his newsletter onto the residents was not constitutionally protected. However, while the antiharassment order was properly based on conduct and not on constitutionally protected activity, the court held that the restriction prohibiting the resident from contacting other project residents in any way and at any location was in excess of the trial court's authority. Also, the trial court abused its discretion under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.14.080 in making the modification to enforce the prior order restraining the resident from posting to the internet any personal identifying information of any current, former, or future staff member or resident because the term &quot;surveillance&quot; was not broad enough to encompass the conduct in the modification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed as to the first antiharassment order providing a no conduct zone around the administrator and the project, but reversed as to restraining the resident from contacting nonparties off premises and in adding conte restrictions to the original antiharassment order. The court also reversed as to the finding of contempt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant vehicle owners challenged a decision from the Superior Court of King County (Washington), which granted summary judgment in favor of respondents, a monorail authority, a state agency, and its director, on claims arising from the imposition of a motor vehicle excise tax (MVET).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners argued that there was an impermissible delegation of local taxing authority under Wash. Const. art. XI, &sect; 12 and Wash. Const. art. VII, &sect;&nbsp;9 because some of the authority's board members were appointed. They sought to enjoin the application of the MVET. After summary judgment was granted, the owners sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that, under the plain language of the Washington Constitution, the Washington Legislature was not limited in its ability to delegate taxing authority. The owners' reliance on Amalgamated Transit Union Local 587 was misplaced. Delegation of taxing power to nonrepresentative entities was permitted since the Legislature clearly defined the purpose of the delegation, and there were adequate procedural safeguards established. The appellate court rejected the arguments that the MVET was an unlawful property tax and that the authority lacked jurisdiction to impose the MVET because it was not imposed on a proper taxing event in its taxing district. Finally, the MVET did not substantially depart from the petition approved by the voters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of King County (Washington) that imposed the jury's sentence of death upon defendant's conviction for three counts of aggravated first-degree murder and one count of kidnapping for the stabbing death of his wife and two of his three daughters.  Defendant had entered an Alford plea specifically denying that he premeditated the murders after he withdrew his not guilty plea by reason of insanity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the death penalty, and the sufficiency of the evidence to support his death sentence under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.95.030. Defendant also raised claims of error regarding the exclusion of jurors, the lack of a premeditation instruction, conflicts with his counsel regarding his defense strategy. The court held that sufficient evidence supported defendant's death sentence because he had a history of domestic violence and brutally killed his wife and two daughters as part of a common scheme. Also the sentence was proportional and defendant failed to show the death penalty was unconstitutional. The court found that the trial court properly excluded jurors for their inability to follow the law and not their views on the death penalty. Also defendant failed to establish that he was denied the benefit of his Alford plea by the lack of an unsought premeditation instruction; that he was denied the right to counsel by the conflict with his counsel as to his defense strategy. The court held that evidence about defendant's mental health was properly presented to the jury, as well as, the challenged crime scene photographs and custodial statements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a guilty plea to manslaughter in the second degree. As part of the agreement, defendant stipulated to facts supporting an exceptional sentence based on victim vulnerability, and he stipulated that there was a legal basis for an exceptional sentence. He also waived the right to appeal the basis for and propriety of the sentence. Defendant later sought review, and the court of appeals affirmed. On appeal, the reviewing court determined that the exceptional sentence did not depend on improper Blakely fact finding. The trial court was not required to find other aggravating factors supporting the sentence given defendant's stipulations. Therefore, the case only presented an issue as to whether the plea was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. Because the portions of the plea agreement stipulating to the facts supporting the exceptional sentence and the legal basis for the exceptional sentence were indivisible from the rest of defendant's plea agreement, he was unable to challenge the exceptional sentence without challenging the entire plea. Likewise, defendant was unable to challenge the validity of his appeal waiver without challenging his entire plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two consolidated cases, the State and plaintiff employees appealed the decision of the Court of Appeals (Washington) holding that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.17.760 was unconstitutional. The statute governed a labor union's ability to use agency shop fees, the fees paid by educational employees who were not union members. The cases stemmed from a complaint filed against defendant education union with the Washington Public Disclosure Commission (PDC).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union was the exclusive bargaining agent for state educational employees. Both members and nonmembers had to contribute to the union for the costs related to collective bargaining. The State claimed that the union violated &sect; 42.17.760 because it failed to get the affirmative authorization of nonmembers before using nonmembers' fees for political purposes. The court affirmed and held that &sect; 42.17.760 did not require written authorization, and the court presumed that written authorization was not what was intended. The union was prevented from spending any portion of a nonmember's agency fees for political causes without the affirmative authorization of the nonmember. A presumption of dissent violated the First Amendment rights of both members and nonmembers. Written permission was not required. Because there was no compelled support if the union utilized the Hudson procedures, there was no governmental interference with First Amendment rights of nonmembers for &sect; 42.17.760 to protect against. The union engaged in expressive activity and &sect; 42.17.760's opt-in requirement significantly burdened the union's association with agency fee payers with regard to its political speech.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, arguing that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.120 facially or as applied, runs afoul of the constitutions of the United States and the State of Washington. The reviewing court ruled that the statements were properly admitted. Where non-testimonial hearsay statements of a child were at issue, the statements were admissible if there was compliance with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.120 and the Ryan reliability factors. Defendant had not challenged any of the trial court's findings of fact in support of its conclusion that the child was unavailable and that her statements were reliable. The requirements for admission under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.120 comported with the general approach utilized to test hearsay against confrontation guaranties under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 22.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over defense counsel's objection, the jury was instructed that &quot;threat&quot; meant to communicate, directly or indirectly, the intent to wrongfully cause physical damage to the property of a person other than the actor, and defendant's proposed instruction defining a &quot;true threat&quot; was denied. The court of appeals found that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.61.160(1) was neither overbroad nor limited to unprotected speech, and the jury was properly instructed. The supreme court ruled that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.61.160 should be construed to apply only to true threats, and the jury was improperly instructed. The jury instructions given at trial were insufficient to ensure a constitutional verdict, and the instructional error could not be deemed to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury must be instructed that a conviction under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.61.160 required a true threat and must be instructed on the meaning of a true threat. A &quot;true threat&quot; was a statement wherein a reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted as a serious expression of an intention to inflict bodily harm upon or to take the life of another individual.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Counts 2 and 3 of the complaint against the attorney arose out of separate sets of events that occurred in 1996-1997 and 1988-1991, respectively. Count 2 alleged that the attorney had improper contact with a represented party. The issue was whether a lawyer who was representing himself or herself was, in the words of Wash. R. Prof. Conduct 4.2(a), &quot;representing a client.&quot; The supreme court ruled that under Wash. R. Prof. Conduct 4.2(a), a lawyer acting pro se was prohibited from contacting a party represented by counsel in the matter.  Wash. R. Prof. Conduct 4.2(a), was impermissibly vague as to its applicability to pro se attorneys, the supreme court's interpretation of the rule would be applied prospectively only, and the alleged violation in count 2 would be dismissed. As to count 3, the attorney conceded that conflicts of interest arose out of the series of events. The supreme court ruled that although the presumptive sanction for knowing violating Wash. R. Prof. Conduct 1.7 was suspension, the mitigating factors, in particular the extensive delay in both reporting and prosecution, demanded a more lenient sanction.</SPAN></P>

Following completion of the sewer system, the district adopted a resolution that governed the use of the system. Under the resolution, the district could compel property owners to connect to the sewer when a dwelling or other structure used by humans was situated on any lot within the district. Under the resolution, no guaranteed right to connect to the sewer system was created. The landowner had not developed any of the lots it owned. The state supreme court reversed the court of appeals and held that given that the lots at issue were not improved, were not connected to the sewer system, and had no guaranteed right to connect upon improvement, sewer service was not available to the lots under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 57.08.081(1). The matter was remanded to the trial court to enter summary judgment for the landowner.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the reversal, and held that the trial court departed from the general guidelines because it first should have reinstructed and allowed the jury to continue deliberations. Also, a more balanced investigation into the allegations should have been conducted. The court affirmed the court of appeals' adoption of the &quot;any reasonable possibility&quot; standard that a juror could not be dismissed where there was any reasonable possibility that his views stemmed from an evaluation of the sufficiency of the evidence. The trial court's finding recognized that the juror in question had expressed some valid disagreement with the other jurors' views of the evidence and when weighing the conflicting evidence, there was no indication that the trial court applied the heightened evidentiary standard adopted.</SPAN></P>

The instant court held that the taxes imposed were not constitutionally or statutorily prohibited. The plain language of Washington's tax authorization and collection statutes satisfied the constitutional requirement that the authorities' use of vehicle registration as the taxable event was done in pursuance of law. The authorities' vehicle taxes satisfied the requirement that excise taxes must be voluntary, as there was no requirement that residents of the taxing districts own or continue to own a motor vehicle. The instant court also concluded that the legislature authorized the excise taxes be collected annually. The taxes were not preempted by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.08.010. The authorities had not undertaken the issuance of vehicle licenses, as prohibited by &sect; 46.08.010. Instead, the authorities implemented a duty authorized excise tax on the privilege of relicensing a vehicle for use on the public roadways.

The Washington Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's dismissal of the petition, recognizing a common law de facto parent status in Washington. The appellate court also reinstated the former partner's alternative petition for third party visitation pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.10.160(3). The mother petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court concluded that the former partner, who was neither a biological nor adoptive parent of the child, had standing under Washington law to petition the courts for a determination of coparentage with regard to the child. It noted that the equitable power of the courts to adjudicate relationships between children and families was well recognized. It also observed that the legislature had evinced no intent to preclude the application of an equitable remedy in circumstances such as these. The instant court held that Washington's common law recognized the status of de facto parents and granted them standing to petition for a determination of the rights and responsibilities that accompanied legal parentage in the state. The former partner was given the opportunity to present evidence to the trial court sufficient to establish her status as a de facto parent of the child and if successful to obtain the rights and responsibilities attendant to parentage. However, the former partner did not have standing to assert rights to visitation with the child under &sect; 26.10.160(3) because that statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A citizen filed a recall petition and charged, inter alia, that the mayor had committed recallable misfeasance by offering an opportunity to obtain an internship with his office as part of an effort to pursue a sexual relationship with a young person he met while on-line in an internet chat room. In addition to finding the charge legally sufficient, the trial court also corrected the ballot synopsis to include specific details supported by documentation either attached to the original petition or subsequently submitted by the citizen. The appellate court affirmed the correction of the ballot synopsis and held that under Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&nbsp;29A.56.140, the trial court had authority to make the changes that included dates and other details that were in the supplemental papers submitted with the petition. The appellate court also held that the charge was legally and factually sufficient as the alleged facts were sufficient to raise the inference that the mayor committed wrongful acts that affected his performance as the pursuit of a sexual relationship in exchange for an intern position would constitute misfeasance pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&nbsp;29A.56.110(1)(a).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner challenged an order of a Superior Court (Washington) adjudicating public use and necessity that authorized respondent Seattle Monorail Project (SMP) to condemn its property to build a monorail station.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties stipulated that the proposed use for the property was a public use. The trial court ruled that because eminent domain procedures of Wash. Rev. Code ch. 8.12 governed condemnation actions, SMP had statutory authority to condemn property. The court affirmed and held that powers reasonably necessary to carry out a grant of eminent domain power could be inferred from the authorizing statute or other statutes and that by implication, ch. 8.12 applied to the SMP. Further the SMP properly followed the condemnation method prescribed for cities in ch. 8.12. The owner pointed to no authority that required a condemning authority to have a public use planned for property forever. Moreover, providing that decisions as to the type of property interest to be acquired were reviewed under the deferential legislative standard, the SMP's determination to condemn a fee interest was a legislative question. The SMP's contentions that it needed all of the property for a substantial period of time to build and construct a monorail station was supported by the record. Given the absence of fraud, the determination to condemn a fee interest in the entire property was necessary to the public use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of three counts of attempted murder in the first degree in the Superior Court of King County, Washington. The trial judge concluded that the offenses arose from &quot;separate and distinct criminal conduct&quot; and, consequently, imposed consecutive sentences on all counts. Defendant appealed, asserting that the imposition of consecutive sentences was unconstitutional in light of Blakely v. Washington and Apprendi v. New Jersey.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that because the imposition of consecutive sentences had the effect of increasing his total sentence beyond the statutory maximum sentence for any one of the counts, he was denied his constitutional right to have a jury determine all of the facts necessary to support consecutive sentencing. However, under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.589(1)(b), sentencing courts were required to impose consecutive sentences when a defendant was convicted of two or more serious violent offenses that arose from separate and distinct criminal conduct. The appellate court held that consecutive sentences were not prohibited where a sentencing court's determination that two crimes were separate offenses under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.589(1)(b) did not operate to elevate either crime to the equivalent of a greater offense merely because it resulted in two standard range sentences running consecutively. A trial court's imposition of consecutive sentences under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.589(1)(b) that did not increase the penalty for any single underlying offense beyond the statutory maximum provided for that offense did not run afoul of the decisions of the United States Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court, King County (Washington) convicted defendant of first degree robbery and first degree kidnapping. Defendant appealed. On appeal, defendant questioned whether his convictions violated principles of double jeopardy and, alternatively, whether his kidnapping convictions merged into his robbery convictions. He also questioned whether his consecutive sentences for kidnapping were unconstitutional in light of Blakely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was part of a trio that robbed a jewelry store. Defendant was convicted of kidnapping and robbing the two jewelry store owners, and the jury returned a special verdict that defendant was armed with a firearm during the commission of each kidnapping and robbery. Defendant's total sentence was 228 months in prison. Review was limited to determining whether the legislature intended to allow multiple punishments for criminal conduct that violated both the robbery and kidnapping statutes. Applying the same evidence test, the court concluded that the robbery and kidnapping charges against defendant were not the same in fact or law and that double jeopardy principles did not preclude separate convictions for robbery and kidnapping. Defendant could be punished separately for robbery and kidnapping. Apprendi and Blakely had no application to consecutive sentencing decisions so long as each individual sentence remained within the statutory maximum for that particular offense, as was the case here.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The group participated in the initial public hearings on the project, but the county failed to provide notice or a public hearing for the permit extensions and the group did not learn of the continued existence of the project until seven years after the last public hearing. The court held that under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70C.040(2), the trial court was correct to dismiss the group's challenges to the permit extensions because the LUPA petition was filed over 21 days after the extensions were made available to the group. Further, in challenging the grading permit, the group challenged the validity of the special use permit and its extensions, and because appeal of the special use permit and its extensions were time barred, the group could not collaterally attack them through its challenge to the grading permit. Also, the trial court correctly found the grading permit was valid, and the group had not challenged the factual findings; the tribe had submitted an extensive application for the permit, retained a surveyor to work on the property, obtained a forest practice conversion permit, put into place an excavator, chain saws, and logging equipment, and removed trees from the property.</SPAN></P>

After restitution was ordered, both defendant and the State sought review. The court of appeals held that the State was entitled to appeal, the trial court abused its discretion by ordering restitution to one victim in the total amount stolen, and the order of restitution to another victim was not an abuse of discretion. Defendant then sought review. In affirming the court of appeals, the court determined that the State was entitled to appeal the restitution order, asserting that the trial court abused its discretion. Further, Apprendi and Blakely did not apply to restitution under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.753 because the decision to order restitution was discretionary. Finally, the court of appeals properly remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing on one victim's losses and to determine whether restitution should be imposed for attorney fees and costs incurred by all victims allegedly as a direct result of the thefts. There was evidence that one victim had recovered some of the amount stolen, and the escrow funds were not his property at any rate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied the families' motion for summary judgment and granted the intervenor medical groups' cross-motion to dismiss.

The families cast their unconstitutionality claim as a challenge to whether I-330 was validly within the legislative power, whereas respondent secretary of state and intervenor medical groups labeled the claim as a challenge to the substantive validity of I-330. Preelection review of an initiative was appropriate only when it was clear that an initiative exceeded the scope of the broad legislative power under art. II, &sect; 1. The families' claim as to the scope of the legislative power was a pretext for a challenge to the possible constitutionality of several sections of I-330. Because the families offered no theory under which I-330 exceeded the legislative power, other than this allegation of some sections unconstitutionality, the families' claims were not justiciable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed a trial court order dismissing plaintiff property owner's suit claiming that a local improvement district (LID) assessment by respondent city was an unconstitutional taking and a violation of due process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court held that the trial court properly dismissed each of the property owner's five causes of action because the LID assessment was conclusively correct once the time period for challenging it had passed. The property owner did not challenge the validity or amount of the LID assessment until over one year after the assessment roll was confirmed. The property owner was required to use the prescribed statutory procedure set forth in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.44.190 for challenging the assessment but failed to do so. Accordingly, the assessment was conclusively correct and could not in any manner be contested or questioned by any person. Because the trial court lacked jurisdiction to collaterally review the propriety of the LID assessment and because the property owner's state and federal constitutional claims were premised on its assertion that the assessment was in excess of special benefits and as such unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious, and unduly oppressive, its claims were without substance. The trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant the relief the property owner sought - a redetermination of the assessment amount.</SPAN></P>

A teacher filed a successful suit contending that the decision violated the state constitution and Initiative 732, which provided base salaries for teachers. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that it had never held that the Basic Education Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 28A.150.200 through 28A.150.510, defined the scope of the State's constitutional duty to provide education. The court then considered the subject appropriation bills and concluded that they did not contain an explicit declaration that the legislature had found learning improvement days to be a part of basic education. Furthermore, the court found that the headers and the disclaimer in the appropriation bills were insufficient to make the program part of basic education. Lastly, the court held that the teacher had not shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the legislature violated the constitution by reducing the number of days it was willing to fund learning improvement days.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Yakima County Superior Court, Washington, dismissed petitioner residents' petition against respondents, the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC) and utility corporations, claiming that the WUTC improperly allowed utilities to take costs imposed upon them by the Yakima Indian Nation (Nation) and pass them on to the bills of all customers living within the reservation. The court of appeals affirmed. The residents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents argued that the WUTC unlawfully allowed the utilities to pass the Nation's tax on to their utility bills. The appellate court found that it had to primarily apply Washington state law, thereby requiring utilities to pay only prudent expenses. The WUTC did not act in an arbitrary and capricious manner in determining the tax was valid and thus a prudent expense. For the purposes of Indian law taxation of utilities, a tax that was not &quot;clearly invalid&quot; was a prudent expense. The WUTC treated a franchise fee differently from a tax. A utility could pass a tax on to the bills of taxpayers within the taxing jurisdiction. A franchise fee was considered a cost of doing business and could be distributed only as an expense to all ratepayers served, systemwide. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 80.280.090 was designed to ensure that all ratepayers in the same area paid the same rate and were not unfairly discriminated against in that manner. In the reservation, all residents were receiving the same utility services for the same price. Since none of the residents' claims were valid, the utilities' argument that the residents failed to join the Nation did not need to be addressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The drivers had been convicted for reckless driving, vehicular homicide, eluding police, and multiple driving under the influence convictions. Under the statutes for those crimes, the Washington Department of Licensing was required to revoke the drivers' licenses for varying lengths of time. The drivers had successfully challenged the revocations on the basis that they were denied sufficient due process. While the city acknowledged that a person had a right to due process prior to the suspension of his or her driver's license, it argued that sufficient due process had been afforded the drivers under the statutes at issue. The supreme court noted that sufficient due process requirements existed for those who had their driver's license suspended based on a criminal conviction. The supreme court held that statutes that required a mandatory suspension based on a conviction provided a heightened government interest in highway safety and a decreased likelihood of erroneous depravation. The supreme court concluded that the statutes were constitutional as applied to the drivers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was convicted of being a minor in possession of drugs, and his sentence included a mandatory revocation of his driver's license under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.265. No separate pre-suspension hearing was provided. He was then convicted on five counts of driving while license suspended. He then filed motions to vacate his driving while license suspended convictions, which were denied. The appellate court noted that defendants who had their license revoked under either Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.270 or Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.265 did not have a constitutional right to a hearing by the Washington Department of Licensing prior to suspension. The appellate court held that although a driver's license was a substantial private interest, erroneous deprivation was unlikely because a defendant personally appeared before a judge for imposition of the suspension and there was a significant government interest in the license revocation of convicted criminals. The appellate court concluded that a conviction that resulted in a mandatory license suspension for a minor, under Wash. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When a bus driver told defendant to exit the bus, he refused, raised his fist, and cocked it back as if to hit the driver. He was charged with unlawful bus conduct for exhibiting harassing behavior, a misdemeanor. Based solely on the incident report, the district court committed defendant on the basis that he was incompetent and that the pending charge alleged a violent act. Defendant argued that the State failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the charge alleged a violent act. The court of appeals held that the standard was a preponderance of the evidence and that the State met its burden. The supreme court disagreed. Due process required that the standard of proof under &sect; 10.77.090(1)(d)(i) was clear and convincing evidence. Though defendant was no longer in custody, the matter was not moot since the finding that he was charged with a violent act had potential collateral consequences sufficient to constitute restraint under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.36.010. The incident report did not contain clear and convincing evidence that defendant's threatened behavior, if carried out, would have resulted in physical pain or injury, illness, or an impairment of physical condition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found the warrant was valid under the Fourth Amendment. On appeal, the court held that the warrant was invalid under the Fourth Amendment because the municipal judge lacked the authority to issue an administrative search warrant for noncriminal building or housing code violations absent authorization by statute or court rule. Therefore the court reversed the dismissal of the &sect; 1983 claim against the city and remanded for a determination of whether an official city policy or custom caused the team members to violate the owner's Fourth Amendment rights. However, the court affirmed the dismissal of the owner's claim against the individual team members on the ground that they were qualifiedly immune under &sect; 1983. As to the owner's trespass claim, the court held that he failed to comply with the 60-day claim filing requirement of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.96.020(4) and that &sect; 4.96.020(4) applied to suits against individual municipal employees for acts committed within the scope of their employment, but that the team members were not completely relieved of personal liability, because they could still be answerable for trespass for acts outside of the scope of their employment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that for a material to qualify as &quot;mixed waste&quot; under the CPA definition, it had to have both a nonradioactive component and a radioactive component.

The CPA was also devoid of any such a requirement. The CPA included some materials that did not &quot;designate&quot; as dangerous waste. The definition of &quot;mixed waste&quot; encompassed materials that were not &quot;solid wastes&quot; under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 6901-6992k, to the extent that a hazardous substance, as defined in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 70.105D.020(7)(b)-(d), failed to qualify as a solid waste for lack of being discarded or otherwise abandoned, recycled, or inherently waste-like. The operation of the CPA did not prevent the intrasite transfer of waste. The naval exemption was limited to those materials specifically listed, but did not extend to other materials that qualified as hazardous substances.

However, the supreme court held that in Shaffer, the court of appeals erred in concluding that the due process protections articulated in In re Winship rendered Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.5055(12)(a)(v)&nbsp;unconstitutional. Winship held that every element of a crime had to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the fact that a defendant was previously convicted of negligent driving in the first degree (Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.5249), reckless driving (Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.500), or reckless endangerment (Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.050), was sufficient to satisfy a defendant's due process protections where all elements of the offense were established by virtue of the conviction itself, and where the prosecution could establish that intoxicating liquor or drugs were involved in that prior offense. Accordingly, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.5055(12)(a)(v) survived constitutional challenge and Shaffer was overruled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The associations argued that because they only had until July 23, 2005, to gather approximately 100,000 signatures on their petition for referendum, a writ of mandamus was the only proper remedy. The associations argued that the rights provided by Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 should be liberally construed. The supreme court noted that the constitutional grant of power to the people was not without limitations. The legislature could suspend the right of the people to order a referendum on a bill where the bill was necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or in support of state government and its existing public institutions. Given the substantial deference to the legislature in a legislative declaration of emergency, the emergency clause in Section 7 of the Washington Substitute Senate Bill 6078 covering sections 1 and 2 of that bill was valid and was not obviously false or a palpable attempt at dissimulation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendants argued for retroactive application of Blakely based on state law; defendant two also challenged the use of erroneous accomplice liability instruction. The supreme court found that defendants did not make a compelling case that there were reasons for retroactive application that were sufficient under State law, and concluded that neither Apprendi nor Blakely applied retroactively to cases already final on direct review. The supreme court also found in defendant two's case that the prosecution largely based its case on the theory that the jury could convict defendant two of first degree felony murder if it found that he was either the principle or an accomplice in the underlying crime of robbery, contending that the jury should convict defendant of robbery based on nothing more than his admission that he intended to commit theft against the victim. Thus, defendant two's ability to present his defense was fatally compromised; he showed actual and substantial prejudice in that the State repeatedly told the jury that it could convict defendant two of murder without first finding that he intended to do anything but steal certain items.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. A police officer may arrest a person for driving while license suspended and take a reasonable amount of time to investigate; he was not bound to cite and release in short order. Read together, Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 10.31.100 and 46.64.015, and Wash. Crim. R. Ct. Ltd. Juris.2.1 allowed officers to arrest a person for driving while license suspended and then exercising discretion to retain the person in custody or cite and release. The officer arrested people for driving while license suspended, as he was authorized to do, and then later discussed with them the possibility of release with a citation and promise to appear in court. In defendant's case, the process was truncated by the discovery of methamphetamine, possession of which was a felony. That discovery eliminated the possibility of release.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of second degree robbery in 1998 and sentenced to life in prison under the Washington Persistent Offender Accountability Act (POAA), former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.120 (1998). Later, the Washington Court of Appeals, held his federal robbery conviction was a strike under the POAA. The instant court accepted his second personal restraint petition (PRP), wherein he argued there had been a significant change in the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the Washington Supreme Court noted that to determine if a foreign crime was comparable to a Washington offense, for purposes of the POAA, the elements of the out of state crime had to be compared to the elements of a Washington criminal statute in effect when the foreign crime was committed. The supreme court concluded that the elements of federal bank robbery (petitioner's foreign conviction), and second degree robbery under Washington's criminal statutes, were not factually and legally comparable at the time petitioner was sentenced in Washington, and that the foreign conviction was not a strike under the POAA. That was because the federal bank robbery was a general intent crime, while the offense of robbery in Washington was a specific intent crime. Secondly, until State v. Freeburg (in 2004), synthesized both State v. Bunting and Carter v. United States, and declared that the crimes were not necessarily comparable, the rule in Washington was that federal bank robbery and second degree robbery were comparable as a matter of law. Because Freeburg represented a significant change in the law that was material to petitioner's sentence, his PRP was not time barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court vacated petitioner's sentence and ordered that he be resentenced for the crime of second degree robbery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, defendants sought review of judgments of the Superior Court of Grays Harbor County (Washington) that imposed exceptional sentences pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535 of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 (SRA). One defendant challenged his conviction and the fine imposed for first-degree theft for cutting down old growth cedar trees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought review claiming that the exceptional sentence provisions of the SRA, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535, violated their Sixth Amendment rights to a jury trial in light of the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Blakely v. Washington. The court held that the exceptional sentence provisions of the SRA were still facially constitutional following the Blakely decision but that the specific exceptional sentences imposed upon defendants violated their Sixth Amendment rights. The court found that in each of the cases, the trial judge imposed exceptional sentences based on facts found by the trial court and not supported by jury findings. The court also held that Blakely Sixth Amendment violations were not harmless error because judges, rather than juries, found the facts used to increase sentences; therefore, there was no jury finding beyond a reasonable doubt of aggravating factors warranting an enhanced sentence. Also the court held there was no procedure established for empanelling juries on remand for re-sentencing; therefore, the court remanded the cases for imposition of standard range sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the exceptional sentence provisions of the SRA were facially constitutional but that the exceptional sentences imposed upon the three defendants were unconstitutional. The court held that the harmless error analysis was inapplicable to the violations and remanded the cases for sentencing within the standard range. The court affirmed the theft conviction and fine imposed against defendant who challenged his conviction.</SPAN></P>

The inmate appealed her conviction to Division One of the Court of Appeals (Washington).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that where the legislature had established a statutory framework which defined a base crime which was elevated to a greater crime if a certain fact was present, a trial court could, consistent with the guaranties of due process, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, and a trial by jury, U.S. Const. art. III, &sect; 2, U.S. Const. amend. VI, and Wash. Const. art.

So long as the jury was instructed it had to unanimously agree beyond a reasonable doubt before it could affirmatively answer the special verdict, the constitution was not offended. The supreme court found that the jury was not instructed that it had to find that the victim was placed in reasonable fear that the threat to kill her would be carried out. Also, the State's attempted gap-filling in for the jury instructions did not meet the requirement that all elements of the offense be clearly set forth. Thus, under the instructions in the inmate's case, the supreme court held that the jury was not instructed on all the elements required to convict her of felony harassment under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.46.020.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals reversed, finding Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09.240&nbsp;unconstitutional. The father petitioned for discretionary review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandmother argued that a prior case was no longer good law; however, the appellate court found that it remained binding precedent. The father's challenge stemmed from the language of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09.240 itself. The grandmother argued that the requirement that a visitation petitioner establish a &quot;substantial relationship&quot; with the child preserved the statute's constitutionality. Establishing a substantial relationship was a necessary, though not sufficient, component of a visitation statute that comported with due process. The statutes considered in out-of-state cases did not contain the constitutionally flawed presumption in favor of grandparent visitation present in Washington's statute, and those courts had not held that a showing of harm to the child was required to overcome the presumption that a fit parent acted in the best interest of the child. The unconstitutional portions of the statute, combined with the constitutionally required presumptions not contained in the text, rendered the entire statute unconstitutional. The trial court had to weigh the financial resource of the parties and award fees to the father under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09.140 if appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals was reversed, and the judgment of the trial court was reinstated; the case was remanded to the trial court to weigh the financial resources of the parties and determine if it would award fees to the parent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that he was entitled to counsel at state expense under Wash. Super. Ct. Crim.

The court held that it was apparent that Rule 3.1(b)(2) referred to the right to counsel that was either already constitutionally guaranteed or provided elsewhere in the rules. Further, the court interpreted Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 7.8 to provide counsel after an initial determination had been made that the motion was not frivolous. By not holding a hearing the trial court effectively determined that defendant did not establish grounds for relief and thus would not have been entitled to counsel. The court held that any denial of the right to counsel was harmless because the court of appeals reversed the denial of the motion to withdraw the guilty plea under which defendant may have been entitled to counsel. The court of appeals determined the trial court was incorrect in denying one of his motions to withdraw guilty plea. Because the court of appeals determined a ground for relief, the superior court was incorrect in denying counsel, but this was harmless in light of the subsequent reversal.</SPAN></P>

She also argued that the trial court's use of a parenting evaluator and guardians ad litem violated her right to due process. The instant court held that the trial court properly applied the best interests of the child standard under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.10.100 when making its nonparental custody determination. The paternal grandmother did not establish any basis on which she should have been afforded the fundamental right to make child rearing decisions on behalf of the child. The paternal grandmother's right to due process was not violated by the trial court's use of the parenting evaluation or the guardian ad litem recommendation. The paternal grandmother's request for attorney fees pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.10.080 was denied.</SPAN></P>

The violations were dismissed upon findings that the sign ordinances were unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and an unconstitutional restriction of free speech as applied to the raincoats used by the business. The Superior Court of Kitsap County, Washington, reversed. The business appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the business contended, inter alia, that under the plain language of the sign code, its raincoats were not signs and, therefore, were not subject to the sign ordinance. The county contended that the raincoats were signs, as described by the nonexclusive list of portable signs regulated by the sign ordinance. The supreme court found that the raincoats were designed to function as retail signs; mounting the advertising message on the raincoats rather than cardboard or other material did not obscure the raincoats' character as signs. Therefore, the business's raincoats were signs subject to the county sign ordinance. However, the supreme court also held that Kitsap County, Wash., County Code &sect; 17.445.070(C) was an unconstitutional restriction of commercial speech as applied to the business under the Central Hudson test, as prohibiting persons from wearing signage provided minimal, if any, benefit in aesthetics and safety, and the total ban of offsite advertising did not reflect any method of narrowly tailoring the restriction to meet the specific goals of increased safety and aesthetics.</SPAN></P>

Sess. (Wash. 2004), which allowed for a &quot;Montana style&quot; primary election system and the governor's veto. Petitioners sought a writ of mandamus directing the secretary of state and the governor to conduct the 2004 primary election in accordance with E.S.B. 6453 as passed by the legislature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After Washington's blanket primary election system was declared unconstitutional, the legislature enacted E.S.B. 6453, which created a &quot;Louisiana style&quot; or &quot;top two&quot; primary system, but also allowed for a &quot;Montana style&quot; system should the Louisiana system be declared invalid. After the governor's veto, the resulting legislation, 2004 Wash. Laws 271, created only a Montana style primary system. Petitioners claimed that the enactment process violated the governor's veto powers provided in Wash. Const. art. III, &sect; 12; the subject in title rules in Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19; and the limitation on amendments in Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 38. The court held that the governor did not act outside his veto power because he had vetoed entire sections of the bill, which was clearly allowed under Wash. Const. art. III, &sect; 12.  The court held that there was no violation of the subject in title provision of Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19 because the title was general and encompassed both primary election system styles. The court held that petitioners failed to show that the amendments to E.S.B. 6453 adopted during the legislative process violated Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 38.</SPAN></P>

Division Two of the Washington Court of Appeals held that one county's failure to offer a drug court did not violate that defendant's right to equal protection and due process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Washington State Legislature had enabled counties to promulgate drug courts under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 2.28.170. The court noted that defendants had not shown a fundamental right existed to participate in a drug court program, nor was there any support to find drug offenders were a suspect or semi-suspect class. Applying the rational basis test, the court held the absence of a drug court in a county where a defendant was charged did not violate a defendant's right to equal protection. As to due process, the court could not conclude that a county was arbitrary and capricious where the county failed to establish a program it was not required to establish by statute, and where the program was funded in part by local resources. The legislature had been explicit that while counties could establish drug courts, the legislature was not creating an entitlement for a criminal defendant to any specific sanction, alternative, sentence option, or substance abuse treatment. Thus, defendants' rights to equal protection and due process were not violated by the absence of a drug court in the counties where they were charged.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 29A.60.210.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a hand recount in the governor's election, the board discovered that 573 ballots were coded as having no signature on file, but the workers only checked one place for signatures. Thus, the board decided to recanvass the ballots under &sect;&nbsp;29A.60.210. Respondents petitioned the court for an injunction. The trial court granted the injunction, and the Democratic Committee, the board, and the Secretary appealed. The court held that the board could recanvass the ballots if there was an apparent discrepancy or an inconsistency in the returns, as provided by &sect; 29A.60.210. The phrase &quot;an apparent discrepancy or an inconsistency in the returns&quot; did not mean only an arithmetic error disclosed on the face of the returns, as argued by respondents. Certain ballots were coded as having &quot;no signature on file&quot; without having been fully examined to properly place them in that category. In that sense they were never fully canvassed. That was just the sort of apparent discrepancy or inconsistency that the board could correct through recanvassing. Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting the injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the petitioner was still incarcerated, the King County Prosecutor petitioned for his commitment as a sexually violent predator, but did not allege he had committed a &quot;recent overt act,&quot; that either caused harm of a sexually violent nature or created a reasonable apprehension of such harm. The only direct bar to raising new issues in this court was the abuse of the writ doctrine. This was the petitioner's fourth personal restraint petition. The only reason the petitioner offered for failing to raise his &quot;new issue&quot; earlier was his argument that Albrecht and Henrickson qualified as pertinent intervening legal developments, but that argument had already been rejected. There was no basis for any exception comparable to the actual innocence exception under federal law. The petitioner was not confined pursuant to a criminal conviction, and there was no issue of innocence to consider. It was not enough for the petitioner to show that the State failed to plead and prove a recent overt act. Instead, to avoid dismissal of this petition on abuse of the writ grounds, he had to, at the least, show that, when the State confined him, he was not presently dangerous. He had not done so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner prisoner appealed from a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Washington), which denied his personal restraint petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner drove into a gasoline station and fired at least 11 shots, killing one victim, wounding another, and piercing the clothing of a third victim. The court held that the trial court's closure of the courtroom during voir dire violated the prisoner's constitutional right to a public trial under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 22 because: (1) the trial court did not identify a compelling interest that the closure was essential to protect; (2) even if the trial court's desire to keep the large jury pool intact or to protect the safety of the trial participants were compelling interests, the trial court's ruling was not narrowly tailored in scope or time to preserve those aims; and (3) the trial court gave little more than passing consideration to alternatives to full closure. The remedy was remand for a new trial. Defendant's convictions for first degree attempted murder and first degree assault violated his constitutional protection against double jeopardy. The two crimes were based on the same shot directed at the same victim, and the evidence required to support the conviction for first degree attempted murder was sufficient to convict the prisoner of first degree assault.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate filed a personal restraint petition. The inmate had been convicted of premeditated murder in the first degree and sentenced to death based on a jury's finding of aggravating circumstances of rape, robbery, and burglary. The jury had recommended that leniency not be granted. The court had affirmed the inmate's conviction and death sentence on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed ineffective assistance of trial counsel and that the State's death penalty scheme was cruel and unusual punishment. The court found that the inmate could not establish prejudice from counsel's decision not to object to his being shackled during the guilt phase. Because of the overwhelming evidence of the inmate's guilt, he could not show that there was a reasonable probability that, but for his counsel's deficient performance in failing to object, the outcome of the guilt phase would have been different. Testimony established the inmate's opportunity and motive to commit the crime, and forensic evidence connected him to the crime. However, the court held that the prejudice to the inmate during a special sentencing proceeding could not necessarily be overcome by objective and overwhelming evidence. Although jurors' opportunity to observe the inmate in shackles was partial and fleeting, the balance had to tip in the inmate's favor in the penalty phase given the difference in the nature of the inquiry. Thus, a new trial in the penalty phase was required. The inmate failed to show how the sentencing scheme relating to the death penalty violated the Eighth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With certain exceptions (such as for postal carriers), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.688 required all drivers to wear seatbelts. Respondent citizen was stopped for failing to wear a seat belt, the officer smelled marijuana, and the result was that the citizen was arrested for criminal offenses. However, the Washington trial court suppressed the evidence, finding that &sect; 46.61.688, the basis for the stop, was unconstitutionally vague. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen argued that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.688 was vague because it incorporated federal seat belt safety standards that were difficult to find. However, the Washington Supreme Court noted that an ordinary, reasonable reader would read the entire statute and would recognize that the legislature intended that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.688(3) and (4) were the heart of the statute. Those subsections plainly required every person driving or riding in a motor vehicle be seat-belted or in a child safety seat. Moreover, while seat belt laws had not been challenged across the nation as unconstitutionally vague, the closely related regime of motorcycle helmet laws had been challenged in many sister states. Those statutes, with similar type restrictions, had not been found to be unconstitutionally vague in most of the subject states. The supreme court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.688 was not vague facially because an ordinary citizen reading the statute was put on notice that there was a general obligation to wear a seat belt. Finally, a future due process challenge to the statute was possible, but that issue was not before the supreme court in the instant case.</SPAN></P>

They were convicted of the unlawful possession of a controlled substance. After their convictions were upheld by the court of appeals, defendant sought further review. Specifically, they asked the court to overrule case law finding that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.401(d) did not have a mens rea element. In affirming the court of appeals, the court declined to make such a ruling. The case law in question properly looked to the language of the mere possession statute, and, because the statute did not have an explicit mens rea element, the ruling court looked to the legislative history. The legislative history for the mere possession statute supported the conclusion that no mens rea element should have been implied. In the 22 years since the case in question was decided, the legislature did not added a mens rea element. Section 69.50.401(d) did not improperly shift the burden of proof. Further, Wash. Rev. Code 69.50.603 did not require an implied mens rea based on uniformity. Finally, the court declined to address the vagueness arguments proffered by defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate was convicted of second-degree robbery. He was committed to the custody of the Washington Department of Corrections (DOC), where he committed over 46 violations of disciplinary rules.  The trial court found the inmate guilty of persistent prison misbehavior under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94.070, which delayed his release eligibility. The Washington Court of Appeals, Division Two, affirmed. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94.070 made it a felony for a prisoner to commit a serious prison infraction after losing all potential earned early release credits. That was the situation in the instant case. The issue on appeal was whether &sect; 9.94.070&nbsp;unconstitutionally delegated legislative authority to the DOC or violated equal protection principles. The Washington Supreme Court noted that, where a criminal prosecution arose under the statute, an inmate was entitled to all of the procedural safeguards that were afforded a defendant in a criminal prosecution. Thus, the supreme court held that &sect; 9.94.070 provided adequate procedural safeguards against arbitrary administrative action and abuse of discretion and did not unconstitutionally delegate legislative authority to the DOC.  Secondly, &sect; 9.94.070 did not create an arbitrary classification between inmates. In fact, no case law existed that distinguished between classes of inmates based on the length of sentence being served for purposes of an equal protection analysis. Consequently, the supreme court held that &sect; 9.94.070 satisfied the State's objective of maintaining prison security and did not violate principles of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Washington) that reversed the trial court decision and held that city utility poles were a traditional public forum and that the city's ordinance codified at Seattle, Wash., Mun. Code &sect;&sect; 15.48.100 through 15.48.130, prohibiting sign posting on utility poles was unconstitutional.

The court of appeals also held that the ordinance was overbroad because it swept within its prohibitions constitutionally protected speech. On appeal, the court concluded that the ordinance did not prevent the public from exercising free speech rights on public streets and other public places and that there were alternate channels of communication sufficient under the standard applicable to non-public forums. The court agreed with the trial court and held that the ordinance was enacted to achieve legitimate governmental purposes, it was reasonable in light of the purposes served by utility poles, and it was content and viewpoint neutral. The court held that utility poles were not a public forum because they were an essential part of the city's power system and they had not been a traditional public forum or historically held open to the general public.</SPAN></P>

The estate owners never applied for a variance or waiver from the mining prohibition under the ordinance. There was no final governmental decision regarding the application of the regulations to the minerals on and in the land. The zoning ordinance did not bar the estate owners from recovering damages from the landowners. The estate owners could extract sand and gravel in a manner that did not raise the issue of subjacent support. The landowners were entitled to utilize the surface soil in developing the site.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City charged defendant with loitering for the purposes of prostitution, in violation of Spokane, Wash., Mun. Code &sect; 10.06.030. The municipal court ruled that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague because it did not define the term &quot;known prostitute.&quot; The Superior Court of Spokane County (Washington) affirmed, and also held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding certain evidence. The City appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance sought to define situations in which a person displayed intent to engage in prostitution-related activity. One situation highlighted by the ordinance, and the language at issue, was when the suspect was a &quot;known prostitute.&quot; Defendant argued that the undefined term &quot;known prostitute&quot; did not provide an ascertainable standard for determining whether a person was loitering with intent to commit a prostitution-related act. Undefined, the term allowed an arresting officer to identify a &quot;known prostitute&quot; as someone with prior convictions or arrests, or merely prior acts of loitering in an area where prostitution occurred. It did not limit police discretion in any way when it came to determination of who was a &quot;known prostitute,&quot; and it provided no standards for locating the line between who was a &quot;known prostitute&quot; and who was not. The unqualified term &quot;known prostitute&quot; could have included anyone from a person with a recent conviction for prostitution to a person who was simply loitering on a street where prostitution occurred. To the extent the ordinance contained the undefined term &quot;known prostitute&quot; the Supreme Court of Washington held it was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner/Intervenor newspaper sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of King County (Washington) that denied its motion to unseal records and directed respondent corporation's special litigation committee (SLC) to file a log as to the documents attached to the SLC's report and motion to terminate a shareholder derivative suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted interlocutory review of the limited question of whether the trial court applied the correct legal standard when it sealed material and briefing filed in support of the SLC's motion to terminate a shareholder derivative action. The corporation claimed that a motion to terminate was like an internal corporate matter or a voluntary settlement agreement and asked that the standards underlying Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 26(c), which allowed a court to limit discovery and its use, be applied. The newspaper argued that a motion to terminate was the functional equivalent to a summary judgment motion and that the trial court erred in not applying more stringent factors before sealing the documentation. The court held that motions to terminate derivative actions were analogous to motions for dispositive judgment, therefore any documents submitted in support of a motion to terminate were presumptively accessible to the public and could be sealed only in accordance with the analytical approach set out in Seattle Times Co. v. Ishikawa. The court noted that the trial court should determine if there was a waiver of attorney-client and work product privilege for any documents.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with one count of unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.401(a)(1)(ii) (1998). Defendant correctly argued police should not have forcibly entered a private dwelling to serve a civil arrest warrant. Police erred in forcibly opening the trailer door when executing it. The &quot;knock and wait&quot; statute did not encompass the execution of civil arrest warrants. The officer improperly used the community caretaking function in retrieving the jacket. Evidence obtained from entry into the trailer should have been suppressed. Evidence from the boathouse which should have been considered by the trial court was not admitted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City exercised its authority under Wash. Rev.

The court of appeals found that the City's &quot;rule of five&quot; substantially accomplished the purpose of chapter 41.12, but that the &quot;rule of 25 percent&quot; did not. The court of appeals struck the impermissible language from the ordinance and validated the remainder. On review, the court held that, because the legislature had enacted another statute that permitted the certification of six names and thus believed that certifying six names could accomplish the purpose of promotions based on merit, the court would adhere to the legislature's &quot;benchmark.&quot; The court held that cities would substantially accomplish the purpose of chapter 41.12, so long as their system provided for appointment by certification of no more than six names. The court also held that the court of appeals appropriately severed the invalid ordinance language pertaining to the &quot;rule of 25 percent.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defense counsel made no objection to the apparently inconsistent verdicts. Defendant argued the inconsistent verdicts violated his rights to due process and therefore his second-degree assault conviction should be reversed. In the alternative, he argued that former Wash.

The special verdict was separate and distinct from the underlying conviction, and posed only to determine whether defendant should be registered as a sex offender. The testimony of all three witnesses established sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that defendant was guilty of assault with intent to commit indecent liberties. Because the general guilty verdict was supported by sufficient evidence, the court of appeals was affirmed, upholding defendant' conviction. A special verdict supplemented a general conviction in order to determine if sex offender registration was warranted. Former Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a Washington Superior Court of first-degree statutory rape of a friend's child in 1979. In 2002, after many appeals, the Indeterminate Sentence Review Board (ISRB) determined that defendant was not rehabilitated and extended his minimum sentence by more than 14 years. Defendant filed a personal restraint petition (PRP) against the ISRB.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his restraint was unlawful, because his sentence was significantly longer than the standard range provided for in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 (SRA), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 9.94A. The appellate court concluded that, between a statutory requirement that a prisoner was not released until rehabilitation was complete and a duty to attempt consistency with the SRA, the statutory requirement trumped the duty to attempt. The ISRB had to make reasonable attempts to set its minimum sentences consistent with the SRA, but had no duty to parole an unrehabilitated prisoner. Defendant did not meet his initial burden of arguing under established jurisprudence that the consideration of his slang dictionary was impermissible. There was ample evidence supporting the ISRB's conclusion that defendant was not rehabilitated and evidence to the contrary was duly considered. Psychological screening and evaluation tests suggested that defendant presented a high risk of committing another violent offense within six months after release. The ISRB properly concluded that defendant presented too great a risk to be released to the community at this time.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.289 violated procedural due process. Defendants had been charged with driving while license suspended, in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.342(1)(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case consolidated direct review of two separate district court orders dismissing charges against two defendants for driving while license suspended. In both cases, the district court concluded mandatory suspension of their licenses pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.289 violated procedural due process, because defendants were not afforded an administrative hearing by the Department of Licensing before or after the effective date of the suspensions. By implication, the district court's orders also invalidated Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.324(1), which provided that a person should not be entitled to an administrative hearing when the license suspension or revocation was mandatory. The supreme court affirmed, holding that Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 46.20.289 and 46.20.324(1) violated due process. The statutes did not provide adequate procedural safeguards to ensure against the erroneous deprivation of a driver's interest in the continued use and possession of his or her driver's license. As such, because a driver could not be convicted of the offense of driving while license suspended where the suspension violated due process, the trial court properly dismissed the charges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Port of Seattle and cross-petitioners, a community coalition, a citizens' group, and the State of Washington Department of Ecology, appealed the State of Washington Pollution Control Hearings Board's (PCHB) decision affirming, with 16 new conditions, Ecology's issuance of a water quality certification under &sect; 401 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1341 to the Port so that it could fill wetlands to build a third airport runway.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ecology issued a &sect; 401 certification to the Port finding that there was reasonable assurance that the Port's project to build a third runway would not violate applicable state water quality standards under 40 C.F.R. &sect; 121.2(a)(3). The PCHB affirmed, but added 16 new conditions it deemed necessary for reasonable assurance that state water quality standards would be met. After accepting direct review of the matter, the court held that the record showed there was reasonable assurance that the third runway project would meet state water quality standards. However, a water right was not necessary for reasonable assurance because the Port's low flow offset plan involved management of storm water, rather than its use where the Port would merely maintain existing stream hydrology. While there was minimal risk that in the absence of a water right the Port's access to its storm water could someday be threatened, the risk was properly accounted for in the reasonable assurance determination.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant private industries brought an action against respondents, the Washington State Department of Corrections, Division of Correctional Industries and a private industry, alleging that an inmate labor contract under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 72.09.100(1) violated Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 29. The Superior Court of King County (Washington) entered a judgment for respondents. The court affirmed but granted the industries' motion for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 72.09.100(1), the Department of Corrections created a program of inmate labor under which it entered into a contract with respondent industry. The contract provided access to inmate labor that competitors did not enjoy, allowed the use of correctional facility space rent-free, and provided free or discounted utilities. Respondent industry interviewed, hired, and paid the inmates. Respondents argued that Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 29, which provided that the State of Washington could not let out by contract the labor of inmates to a private entity, only referred to the sale or lease of a commodity. The court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 72.09.100(1) directly conflicted with Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 29. The court held that Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 29 limited inmate labor to profit the State rather than private enterprise and sought to prevent direct competition between inmate and free laborers. The program unconstitutionally let out inmate labor by contract for the benefit of private enterprises. To the extent that it held otherwise, Washington Water Jet Workers Association v. Yarbrough, 148 Wash. 2d 403, 61 P.3d 309 (2003) was overruled.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court reversed the appellate court's decision, stating that the City's charge exceeded the taxing authority granted to cities and towns under Wash. Rev.

The legislature explicitly provided authority for an excise tax to fund the ambulance services authorized by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.21.766 and that section included no language expressly authorizing a municipality to set rates for an ambulance service or to regulate the ambulance service. Accordingly, the supreme court was unpersuaded that &sect; 35.21.766 implied the power to impose ambulance utility rates on every house, business, and industry mentioned in Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In four different cases, plaintiff parents of deceased adult children brought various claims under the wrongful death and survival statutes against various defendants in federal district court. The federal court certified a question as to whether a parent of an adult child had to have been financially dependant on that child in order to recover for loss of consortium under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.24.010.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The four cases were consolidated for review and the parents argued that the legislature's 1998 amendment to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.24.010 redefined who could bring a cause of action under that statute and that the amendment allowed the parent of an adult child to recover upon a showing of emotional support upon the child. The supreme court disagreed, holding that the language of the statute and its legislative history did not support the conclusion that the requirement of financial dependency on adult children was addressed or changed by the 1998 amendments. Rather, &sect; 4.24.010 required that parents be financially dependent on an adult child in order to recover for that child's injury or death. Contrary to the parents' contention, the supreme court also found there was a reasonable basis for the statute's treating the parents of adult children differently from parents of minor children. The lines drawn by &sect; 4.24.010 bore a rational relationship to the purpose of the statute. As such, the supreme court held that the statute did not violate the constitutional guaranty of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff nonprofit organization was concerned about tolling as a result of a bridge project. The organization filed suit against defendant State of Washington and claimed, among other things, that the State violated existing state bidding laws. The Thurston County Superior Court (Washington) granted summary judgment in favor of the State. The organization appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principal issues were whether the State violated state bidding laws in executing a design-build agreement and personal service contracts relating to the project, whether the State violated Wash. Rev. Code ch. 47.05, the priority programming statute, and whether Engrossed H.B. 2723 (Wash. 2002) (EHB) violated Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19. The court concluded that summary judgment was proper. The court held that the Public-Private Transportation Initiatives Act (PPI Act) created an exemption for projects under the PPI Act from the requirements of the bidding laws. Therefore, the original agreement that the State entered into was lawfully executed. Because the original agreement was lawfully executed, the amended agreement, the design-build agreement, and the personal service contracts were not subject to the bidding laws. The court saw no conflict between the priority programming statute and the alternative bidding process under the PPI Act. Both statutes aimed at achieving efficiencies in developing transportation improvement projects. Finally, the court held that EHB 2723 did not violate the single-subject rule or the subject-in-title prong of Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>

Addressing the intent issue, the court held that neither the First Amendment nor &sect; 9A.46.020 required the State to show that defendant intended to carry out the threat in order for the statements to constitute a true threat. However, after applying the rule of independent review, the court determined that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction under &sect; 9A.46.020. Defendant and the classmate to whom he made the alleged threat had no negative history and had joked with each other on occasion. Others in the class had also laughed at defendant's jokes. According to the classmate, defendant giggled as he made the comments, as if he had been joking. Only later did she think his statement might have been a threat.

The court held that the petition method utilized by the first two cities was not unconstitutional and that the petition method of annexation employed by the third city was constitutional. Further, the fire districts had neither personal standing nor representational standing in the cases. After considering the Gunwall factors, the court stated that art. I, &sect; 12 provided a basis for constitutional challenge independent from U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. The petition method of annexation statutes were constitutional because they did not implicate a fundamental right and did not afford any class a privilege or immunity.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, complaining that the controlled substance was not specifically identified in the State's amended information. The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the State did not have to identify the specific controlled substance in the information. Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant challenged the amended information and contended the evidence was insufficient to prove intent to deliver. The amended information upon which defendant was convicted identified the controlled substance as &quot;meth&quot; rather than the full name &quot;methamphetamine,&quot; while the original information did fully identify the specific controlled substance. The supreme court found that, while the amount of methamphetamine alone might not have been sufficient to convict defendant, evidence, which included baggies later found to contain methamphetamine, a scale, additional baggies, and vials, was sufficient to convict defendant. However, as the statutory maximum sentence increased depending on which controlled substance defendant possessed, the State was obligated to allege and prove the substance defendant possessed was methamphetamine. Thus, the appellate court erred in ruling otherwise. Nonetheless, the State's failure to specifically identify the controlled substance in the amended information did not require reversal, as defendant had actual notice of the identity of the controlled substance that formed the basis of the charge by the arrest warrant and the first information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To the extent the appellate courts' opinion excused the State from alleging the specific controlled substance in an information, it was disapproved. However, the appellate court's judgment was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class action suit was brought against the DSHS in an effort to improve the lives of foster children in the State's care. Among other things, the class members sought to force the DSHS through a variety of legal claims to drastically reduce the number of time foster children were moved while in the State's care. The trial court granted an injunction substantially governing the State's foster care system. The court vacated, holding that foster children had substantive due process rights to be free of unreasonable risk of harm, and a right to reasonable safety. Alleged violations of that right were to be measured on the professional judgment standard. The jury instructions did not correctly articulate the right and the standard, and that the error was not harmless. The trial court also erred by admitting the ombudsman's report and evidence of national aspirational standards. The trial court did not err in its judgment on the use of fiscal constraints or by admitting evidence of past DSHS conduct.  Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 74.14A.050(2) and (3), and 74.13.250, and 74.13.280 did not create a private cause of action.  42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 671(a)(16), 675(1) were not privately enforceable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of raping a 16-year-old girl. On appeal, he claimed that the trial court should have excluded shoes retrieved from his jail property bag after his arrest on an unrelated charge. The tread of the shoes matched a footprint found at the rape scene. The court found no violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV by the warrantless search and seizure. Moreover, the shoes had already been exposed to police view when the property was inventoried. The court also found no violation of Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, which afforded broader protection that the Fourth Amendment, because, after the inventory of the shoes he wore, defendant no longer had a valid privacy interest in the inventoried items. The court also found no error in exclusion of expert testimony on the reliability of eyewitness identification. On the day of the rape the victim gave a detailed description of her attacker to a sketch artist, having purposefully noted his face, and she later selected defendant from a photograph montage. The expert's proposed testimony about the effects of stress on the memory would not have been likely to aid the jury in assessing the victim's credibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant maintained that her juvenile conviction had to be reversed, because the State did not prove that the victim of her threat was placed in reasonable fear that she would carry out her threat to kill. To obtain a misdemeanor conviction based upon one of the threats listed in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.46.020, the State had to prove the threat made and the threat feared were the same. The appellate court found that, under the plain language of &sect; 9A.46.020, supported by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.46.010, the State had to prove that the victim was placed in reasonable fear that the threat made was the one that would be carried out. Defendant's conviction for felony harassment had to be reversed, because there was no evidence that the victim was placed in reasonable fear that she would kill him. The inquiry into the nature of a threat depended on the facts and circumstances, and could not be limited to a literal translation of the words spoken. The State could still charge one who threatened to kill with threatening to inflict bodily injury, in the nature of a lesser-included offense, thus enabling a misdemeanor charge if the victim was placed in fear of bodily injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent public school union challenged the guidelines appellant Washington State Public Disclosure Commission (PDC) issued interpreting the laws and rules governing the use of public facilities in campaigns under Wash. Rev. Code ch. 42.17. The Superior Court of King County, Washington, declared that the guidelines were unconstitutional and constituted an arbitrary and capricious agency action. The PDC appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the PDC contended, inter alia, that, because the guidelines were the agency's opinion only and could not be violated or enforced, the union was seeking an advisory opinion on an abstract dispute over whether the PDC's opinion violated constitutional rights and/or the state's administrative law. The supreme court found that the PDC issued the guidelines as an aid to the public, interpreting the laws and rules concerning the use of public facilities in campaigns. The guidelines were advisory and did not purport to be anything more. Moreover, there was no evidence indicating that the PDC acted to enforce the guidelines or regulate the union in any manner. As the union challenged the PDC's opinion only, there was no &quot;agency action&quot; for the supreme court to review pursuant to the union's petition for judicial review. Whether the guidelines were a correct or incorrect interpretation of the law presented nothing more than an academic or hypothetical question. The guidelines had no legal or regulatory effect, and the PDC's issuance of the guidelines did not implicate actual or direct legal interests of the union. Thus, the trial court erred in reviewing the union's claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the supreme court determined that the act of confirming and vacating an arbitration award pursuant to Wash.

Further, the manifest procedural error standard did not apply to mandatory arbitration. As the legislature provided a meaningful avenue for relief through the trial de novo, the appellate court erred by utilizing a constitutional writ to reverse the arbitrator's award under Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed an ordinance transferring responsibility to pay for streetlights from the city's general budget to its municipal electric company's customers. The city brought a declaratory action to validate the ordinance after questions regarding its legality were raised. After an initial ruling against the ordinance, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.92.050 was amended by 2002 Wash. Laws ch. 102 to allow municipalities to incorporate streetlight costs into a utility's general rate structure. The trial court reversed itself and granted the city summary judgment upholding the ordinance. The customers appealed, claiming the ordinance imposed an illegal tax. The court agreed. The court found that providing streetlights was a governmental function and the main purpose behind the city's ordinance was to shift the streetlight costs to free up revenue for the city, and not to pay for regulating streetlights. Therefore, the ordinance created a tax. Since the ordinance did not clearly state that it was creating a tax, as required by Wash. Const. art. VII, &sect; 5, and because Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.21.870(1) required taxpayer approval for any tax in excess of six percent, the tax was unlawful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, a county, transit authority, and others, filed a complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that the newly-passed Initiative Measure 776 (I-776) was unconstitutional; appellants, the State, a homeowners association, and others, intervened and sought a declaration that I-776 was constitutional. The King County Superior Court, Washington, declared I-776 unconstitutional. The State and the association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court declared I-776 unconstitutional on the grounds that it embraced more than a single subject and substantially impaired the county's contractual obligations to its bondholders. In challenging the trial court's holding, the State contended, inter alia, that the sole subject of I-776 was the placement of a ceiling on government fees that citizens had to pay to license their vehicles, and that the 11 sections of the initiative were rationally related to that subject. The supreme court agreed, holding that precatory language could not yield additional &quot;subjects&quot; for Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19 purposes; thus, the county and the authority failed to show beyond a reasonable doubt that I-776 required the people to cast a single vote on two unrelated, proposed laws. Nor did the county and the authority meet their burden of showing that I-776's ballot title failed to notify members of the legislature and the public of the subject matter of the measure, that it substantially impaired the county's contractual obligation to its bondholders, that it violated constitutional precepts of local home rule, or that it deprived the voters of a vested property right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners had sought protection from harassment by respondents. After a hearing, the district court issued protection orders preventing either party from contacting the other, even though only petitioners had sought an order.

The court agreed with the court of appeals that petitioners had failed to provide any valid reason for extending the order against respondents. However, the court of appeals improperly vacated the order that had initially been entered against petitioners. The district court, sitting in equity, had power to issue mutual protection orders on its own motion under Wash. Const. art. IV, &sect; 6 and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.14.080(6), which specifically granted broad discretion to fashion relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following convictions for burglary in the first degree and criminal trespass in the first degree, the trial court found defendant to be a persistent offender under the Persistent Offender Accountability Act (POAA), Wash.

The court rejected defendant's claim under U.S. Const. amend. VI, holding that recidivism need not have been pleaded and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt and that no case overruled current case law on that issue. The court agreed with defendant that, under the Gunwall analysis, the Washington Constitution appeared to provide greater protection of the jury trial right than did the federal Constitution, but held that defendant provided insufficient evidence that such broader protection included the right to a jury trial on the fact of prior convictions at sentencing. Most importantly, the court noted that no such right existed by statute or at common law at the time Wash. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 21 and 22 were written; therefore, it was unlikely that the drafters contemplated such a right in &sect;&sect; 21 and 22.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a personal restraint petition challenging his civil commitment as a sexually violent predator. The personal restraint petition, his third, was filed in the Washington Court of Appeals well over one year from the time of his commitment, thus raising the issue of whether the Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090 one-year time limit for filing a personal restraint petition applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was committed as a sexually violent predator pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code ch. 71.09. He had a history of convictions of sexually violent crimes. While he was incarcerated following a parole revocation, a prosecutor petitioned for his commitment as a sexually violent predator. The petition did not allege that defendant committed a &quot;recent overt act,&quot; i.e., an act that either caused harm of a sexually violent nature or created a reasonable apprehension of such harm. The appellate court held that, as Albrecht did not constitute a significant change in the law, as defendant claimed, he had not established that the exception in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.100(6), adopted in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.36.130, applied. The one-year time limitation applied, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.36.130, which incorporated the time allowed in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090. The appellate court also rejected defendant's claim that there had been a significant change in the law bringing him within an exception to the one-year limitation. Finally, it concluded that defendant filed, at best, a &quot;mixed petition&quot; that had to be dismissed without consideration of other issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate actions consolidated on appeal, petitioner inpatients sought review of whether the sexually violent predator act (SVPA), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 71.09, violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the U.S. Constitution, whether actuarial evidence could be admitted to aid in predicting future dangerousness, and whether their respective commitment judgments were subject to reversal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inpatients were ordered to be confined under the SPVA. The court consolidated their respective appeals from such judgments because of common issues, including claims that the SPVA was unconstitutional. The court held first that the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV did not require a separate finding that a sexually violent predator (SVP) had serious difficulty controlling dangerous, sexually predatory behavior but only that there was a connection between the mental illness and the inability to control one's behavior. The court also held the State did not need to prove that an inpatient was completely unable to control his or her behavior. Additionally, the court found that SPVA provision limiting consideration of less restrictive alternatives to confinement until after an inpatient's first annual review did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because the protection of the public from the danger of SVPs and the effective treatment of SVPs constituted rational bases for the restriction. The court also held that actuarial instruments admitted to aid in the prediction of future dangerousness were not novel scientific evidence; hence, no Frye hearing was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the SVPA was not unconstitutional and affirmed the inpatients' respective commitment judgments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the inmate was convicted of aggravated first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole and the conviction was affirmed, he filed a personal restraint petition. The appellate court dismissed the petition, as it was filed after the one-year time limit of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090, and at least one of the claims it contained did not fall within an exception in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.100. The court affirmed on appeal, stating that, if a personal restraint petition with multiple claims was filed after the one-year period expired and the court determined that at least one of the claims was time barred, the petition must be dismissed. It was obvious that the inmate filed a mixed petition that must be dismissed. His personal restraint petition listed four grounds for relief and the second was that the admission of court statements was erroneous under a United States Supreme Court case. However, the case did not represent significant new law material to the inmate's conviction. Accordingly, his personal restraint petition was correctly dismissed as a mixed petition.</SPAN></P>

The plan was found not to violate state or federal law and the district's summary judgment motion was granted. On review, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit certified a state law question regarding Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.60.400.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The underlying action arose when the district adopted a plan that allowed students a measure of choice of schools while attempting to ensure that schools did not become segregated. Because some schools were oversubscribed and not all students had their first choice, the district applied a series of tie breakers, one of which was specifically designed to promote racial diversity. In answering the federal court's certified question in the negative, the supreme court determined that this &quot;open choice&quot; plan's use of a racially cognizant tie breaker did not violate Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.60.400 as it did not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin. To the extent the tie breaker was race conscious, the supreme court determined that it furthered a core mission of public education; to make available an equal, uniform and enriching educational environment to all students within the district. Affirmative action programs which advanced a less qualified applicant over a more qualified applicant were held to be impermissible while programs which were racially neutral were lawful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city brought a foreclosure action. Petitioner property owner, who counterclaimed for declaratory relief, sought reversal of an opinion of the Washington Court of Appeals, which affirmed a lower court decision that a tax lot he purchased was not created in compliance with Wash. Rev. Code ch. 58.17, the state statute on lot boundary adjustments, and the city's ordinance governing the division of land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The primary issue in this case concerned whether the division of land that created the owner's tax lot qualified as a boundary line adjustment for purposes of the exemption from the subdivision statutes set forth in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 58.17.040(6). The owner asserted that, because the tax lot was a division made for the purpose of alteration by adjusting boundary lines and did not create additional lots, it was exempt from the requirements of Wash. Rev. Code ch. 58.17 governing land division, which the city's ordinance mirrored, and was a legal lot. The city claimed that the creation of the tax lot neither complied with applicable subdivision regulations nor qualified as an exemption under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 58.17.040(6). The instant court concluded that the tax lot was a legally created lot with the statutory exemption under &sect; 58.17.040(6). The reconfiguration of boundaries resulted in no new lots. Three lots existed before the adjustment, and three lots existed after the adjustment. The fact that a buildable site was created did not prevent application of the statutory boundary line adjustment exemption.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 77.15.192-.198 outlawed the trapping or killing of any mammal with body-gripping traps, sodium fluoroacetate, or sodium cyanide. The organization was opposed to this initiative and claimed that it violated Wash. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 19, 37. The trial court disagreed and granted the State and sponsors summary judgment. The court affirmed on appeal. Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19 required that bills only contain one subject and that subject be expressed in its title. The statutory provisions addressed methods of trapping and killing animals, and the initiative title banned certain traps and certain poisons. Because particular types of traps and poison used fell within the auspices of methods of trapping and killing animals, the single subject and subject expressed in the title rules had not been violated. There was also no violation of Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 37, as the scope of rights created or affected by the statutory provisions were able to be ascertained without referring to any other statute or enactment, and the statutory provisions did not render existing rights erroneous. The organization failed to show that the statutory provisions were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DOL revoked defendant's license and notified him by sending him an order of revocation and a hearing request form.

When the City learned of this, it charged defendant with driving with a suspended license. Defendant argued that his due process rights were violated because the DOL did not send the notice of revocation to defendant's address on his identicard application. The superior court agreed and upheld the dismissal of the charges. The court reversed on appeal. Pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.205 and Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 308-104-018, the DOL was authorized to update defendant's address based on the traffic ticket because it was written documentation that was signed by defendant and filed by a governmental agency. There was no due process violation because the DOL complied with statutory requirements when it mailed the notice to the updated address. The court reversed the superior court's holding that &sect; 308-104-018 conflicted with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.205 as interpreted by case law.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 9A.56.130 (1975), lacked a requirement that the threat be wrongful, declared former unconstitutionally overbroad, as it prohibited threats that constituted protected speech, and reversed. Respondent individual's sentence was stayed, pending the present appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual was convicted of extortion for threatening to disseminate and, in actuality, disseminating nude photos of a former girlfriend to collect a small claims court judgment he had against her. The individual appealed to the Court of Appeals on the grounds that the extortion statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutionally overbroad. The question before the instant court was whether Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.56.130 (1975) encroached upon a real and substantial amount of free speech. The trial court concluded that the individual knowingly and intentionally attempted to obtain the judgment from the girlfriend by threat and that such threat communicated to the girlfriend an intent to continue to send the nude photos to friends, family, and neighbors. Clearly, there was no nexus between the threat to send nude photos to family and friends and the collection of a lawful judgment. The present court construed the statute, and, using the nexus limiting construction, the individual's conduct constituted second-degree extortion. It was no defense for the individual to assert that his conduct was not extortionate solely because he was trying to collect a legal debt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court was reversed, and the judgment and sentence of the trial court was reinstated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Intervenor organization became a part to appellants' action, which claimed that 2002 Wash. Laws ch. 2, &sect; 2, of I-773, which imposed additional tax on cigarettes and provided that the revenues were to be used to fund certain existing and future healthcare and anti-tobacco programs, was unconstitutional. The court disagreed. The enactment did not violate the biennium bar of Wash. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 4, as the plain language of 2002 Wash. Laws ch. 2, &sect; 2(2)(b), (c) merely authorized appropriations for the several programs to be funded, but required further action by the legislature to cause the appropriations to be made. There was also no violation of Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19. The title of I-773 expressed a general subject, additional tobacco taxes for low-income health care and other programs, the title was broad, and the provisions were rationally related; hence, there was no violation of the single subject requirement. The title also gave adequately notice as to the scope and purpose of the law. I-773 did not revise any law that was not written out in full in the enactment; hence, there was no violation of Wash.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organizations asserted that the agencies failed to perform a duty to adopt rules that they were required by statute to promulgate.

The instant court held that the court of appeals erred in reversing the trial court's dismissal of the organizations' failure-to-act claims. The organizations could judicially challenge the agencies' failure to promulgate rules, but before doing so, they had to petition the agencies for rule making. The organizations' failure to formally petition for rule making precluded their judicial action. The organizations were not excused from failing to petition for rule making. The court of appeals erred in holding that a petition for rule making was not a prerequisite to judicial review of the failure-to-act claims.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim and her husband sued the county and other defendants in King County for personal injuries suffered by the victim in an automobile accident.

The trial court also denied the victim's motion to transfer venue to Yakima County, which would have allowed the action to proceed within the statute of limitations. The trial court's action would have barred the victim's claim because the statute of limitations had expired. The court of appeals, basing its decision on the legislative title of the statute enacting the 1997 amendments to &sect; 36.01.050, held that Cossel v.

In the second action, petitioners alleged that the disputed referendum was outside the scope of the referendum power delineated in Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 1(b). The court dissolved the temporary injunction it had previously granted on petitioners' motion. It refused to issue a writ of prohibition or mandamus. The court held that there was sufficient public interest to justify an exercise of its original jurisdiction pursuant to Wash. Const. art. IV, &sect; 4 and that mandamus was appropriate if the Secretary was to be prohibited from certifying the results. The court held, however, that he was not to be so prohibited. The referendum was not outside the scope of Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; (b). An emergency clause in the disputed legislation applied only to &sect; 2 of Engrossed H.B. 2901, 57th Leg. (Wash. 2002) and not to the remainder of the legislation. The court refused attorney's fees to the tax group and individual and did not reach their cross-petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association members argued that, as recipients of federal funding, they had a property interest in their designations as sole telecommunications providers and that they were therefore entitled to a full adjudicative hearing on the petition of the company. Alternatively, they argued that the commission's decision was arbitrary and capricious under the Washington Administrative Procedure Act (WAPA), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 34.05.001 et seq. The Supreme Court of Washington concluded first that the association members had not established that they had a constitutionally protected U.S. Const. amend. XIV property interest in their status as exclusive telecommunications providers in their service areas; consequently, they were not entitled to an adjudicative hearing on the company's petition for designation as an additional provider. Second, the supreme court concluded that the association and its members, independent rural telephone companies, had not shown that the commission acted arbitrarily or capriciously in concluding that the telephone company met the statutory requirements for designation as an additional eligible telecommunications carrier in the association's area.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The underlying action arose when department of fish and wildlife enforcement officers caught defendant with more than three times the personal bag limit of geoducks while he was harvesting geoducks without a license; defendant maintained that he had been diving in the area to feed his large family and that he did not intend to resell the geoducks. The appellate court held that the statutory scheme created an unconstitutional conclusive presumption. On review, the supreme court disagreed, finding that the language and definitional structure of former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 77.15.110(1)(c) indicated that no presumption as to defendant's state of mind at the time of the offense was required; the language equated particular conduct with the element &quot;acting for commercial purposes&quot; and listed the conduct that satisfied that element.

The supreme court held the regulation did not set rates but only described a method for setting rates, the Commission had authority under Wash. Rev.

Applying the correct definition of &quot;arbitrary and capricious,&quot; the rule was not willful, unreasoning, or taken without regard to the attending facts or circumstances due to its suggested alternatives to make up lost revenue, as the companies could seek adjustments of their rates, if they did not receive sufficient revenue, potential losses while setting new rates did not make the rule arbitrary or capricious, nor was reliance on unreliable universal service cost determinations mandated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 12-year-old juvenile was initially detained after midnight in a brief investigative stop, after police responded to an emergency telephone call reporting juveniles fighting on a city street in an isolated commercial area.

In response to her request to transport him home, the officers conducted a pat down search prior to placing him in a car and found two baggies of marijuana. A search incident to arrest further uncovered money, crack cocaine, and additional marijuana. On review, the juvenile did not dispute that the officers permissibly complied with his mother's request under their community caretaking function, or that they were justified in conducting a pat-down search. However, he asserted that he was impermissibly detained during the time the police telephoned his mother. The court held that the appellate court correctly determined that the officers' intrusion in detaining the juvenile long enough to ask him for his name and telephone number and to telephone his mother was minimal, and that the officers acted reasonably under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate cases, respondents, out-of-state suppliers of wine, alleged to have violated Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 19.126, counterclaimed and moved for summary judgment on the grounds that &sect; 19.126 was unconstitutional. The Superior Court, King County, Washington, granted the suppliers summary judgment. Appellant distributors appealed. Division One of the Court of Appeals, Washington, consolidated the cases and certified both for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal the distributors argued that the stated purpose of Wash. Rev. Code ch. 19.126, which regulated the contractual rights and obligations of wine suppliers and distributors to one another, was to serve legitimate local concerns, that it was not enacted for protectionist purposes, and that it survived commerce clause scrutiny. The court disagreed. The court held that the express exemption of in-state wine suppliers in Wash. Rev. Code ch. 19.126 facially violated the dormant commerce clause because it protected in-state wine suppliers, thereby discriminating against out-of-state suppliers, that the legislation was not saved by U.S. Const. amend. XXI, because exempting in-state suppliers from Wash. Rev. Code ch. 19.126 did not fall within the core concerns of the amendment, and that the exemption of in-state suppliers could not be severed from the remainder of Wash. Rev. Code ch. 19.126 because to do so would impermissibly broaden the statute. The court also affirmed the award of attorney fees to the suppliers, holding that defending against an action based on a statute by successfully arguing the statute was unconstitutional allowed an award of attorney fees under that statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the superior court striking down the challenged statute, held that the supplier in the first case had not breached its oral contract with its Washington distributor, upheld the award of attorney fees and costs at trial, and awarded the suppliers fees and costs on appeal. The court also remanded for resolution of statutory claims that were not before it on appeal consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued, inter alia, that the court of appeals properly reversed the suppression of evidence because the search of the car was a proper search incident to probable cause to arrest defendant for driving while his license was revoked or for drug paraphernalia in plain view. The court of appeals reasoned that a search incident to arrest could occur before an actual custodial arrest so long as probable cause existed to arrest at the time of the search. The supreme court disagreed. The officer did not arrest defendant for driving while his license was revoked, or for either possession or use of drug paraphernalia. Probable cause for a custodial arrest was not enough. There must have been an actual custodial arrest to provide the &quot;authority&quot; of law justifying a warrantless search incident to arrest under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. Because a search could not occur without &quot;authority of law,&quot; and the search incident exception to the warrant requirement was a narrow one, an actual custodial arrest was required before a search occurred. Otherwise, the search was in fact conducted without an arrest, and thus without authority of law existing at the time of the search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer argued that the county hearing examiner lacked the authority to revoke a preliminary plat approval under former Pierce County, Wash. Code &sect;&sect; 18.50.970 and 18.50.975 because state laws establishing procedures for approving subdivision plats preempted the local ordinances. The developer contended that the revocation powers under the county code conflicted with Wash. Rev.

The appellate court determined that the hearing examiner had authority to revoke the preliminary plat under former the ordinances, that state platting laws did not preempt the county from enacting the challenged revocation ordinances, and that the revocation ordinance did not conflict with state platting laws. The appellate court held that the hearing examiner correctly decided revocation was the only remedy because the developer knowingly violated conditions of preliminary plat approval, prohibitions against removal of irreplaceable trees and vegetation in specified areas, which could not be restored to their original state.</SPAN></P>

The father was fined $ 50 for each infraction. The Pierce County Superior Court (Washington) rejected the father's constitutional arguments on appeal and affirmed the convictions. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the father argued that the city's curfew ordinance was unconstitutional in that it was void for vagueness as well as violative of the constitutional right of minors to move freely in public places and of parents to rear their children. The appellate court held that the city ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and, therefore, was void. The court found that the problem with the ordinance was that it did not provide ascertainable standards for locating the line between innocent and unlawful behavior. The ordinance simply did not provide sufficient guidance. Specifically, the term &quot;errand&quot; in the ordinance was also vague in that it failed to provide sufficient notice of what conduct was prohibited or standards for police officers to enforce that conduct. Because the ordinance failed to define what constituted an &quot;errand,&quot; a police officer would be furnished with little guidance as to whether the juvenile engaged in such an activity was in violation of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The King County Superior Court, Washington, dismissed claims based on, inter alia, the Ashurst-Sumners Act of 1935 and all claims brought against the owners in their individual capacity. The instant court accepted plaintiffs' request for direct review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The water jet cutting business employed prisoners to work in the water jet cutting industry. Plaintiffs were an informal association of businesses and individuals who did similar work. Plaintiffs, which voluntarily dismissed their remaining causes of action, sought direct review on only the claims based on Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 29, and the Ashurst-Sumners Act. The instant court concluded that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 72.09.100(1), which allowed prisoners to be gainfully employed by private businesses, was constitutional. Although the Washington Constitution barred the State from selling the involuntary labor of prisoners by use of the contract system of labor, the contract system of labor bore no resemblance to the program established by &sect; 72.09.100(1). Allowing inmates who wished to be employed to work for Class I Free Venture industries benefited the State. Recidivism, violent incidents among prisoners, and the taxpayers' burden were reduced. The legislature had the power to establish this program. The trial court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs' claims based on the Ashurst-Sumners Act, which created no cause of action enforceable via a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fraternal order barred its local chapters from admitting new female applicants on the ground that they would inhibit the secret rituals of the male membership. Several local chapters and female members filed a gender discrimination action. The court, on de novo review, held that the trial court correctly granted the petitioners' motion for summary judgment after concluding that the order was a public accommodation under the WLAD that could not discriminate and was required to admit women into membership. The court held that the appellate court erred in reversing the trial court after reading the ambiguous provisions of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.60.040(10) to automatically exempt the order from public accommodation status merely because it identified itself as a fraternal organization. The court held that the trial court properly determined that the fraternal order was not distinctly private or a selective social club after considering its size of more than a million members worldwide, complex operations, and involvement in community service.

The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, stating that &sect; 2(1)(d) was unconstitutional because it treated every school district employee position as part of basic education solely because of certain funding for that position without regard to any education, educational service, or instruction paid for by the funding, and it impermissibly tied basic education dollars to levy dollars, which could result in lack of uniformity in basic education funding in different districts.

The affidavit indicated that the confidential informant had personal knowledge of conversations petitioners had concerning commission of a robbery in a manner similar to the manner of the robbery and homicide that was committed. The affidavit, when read in its entirety, provided a substantial basis to support the magistrate's finding of probable cause. Petitioners' allegations of an erroneous date was only a scrivener's error and was not sufficient to require suppression of the evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' vehicles were impounded when officers discovered that each driver's driving privileges had been suspended.

Similarly, the state patrol asked whether impoundment of defendant two's vehicle was proper. The supreme court was able to avoid the constitutional issue by resolving the case on statutory grounds. While Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.55.113 permitted vehicle impoundments at the discretion of the officer at the scene, Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 204-96-010 required officers to impound regardless of the circumstances; thus, the state patrol's mandatory impoundment rule was invalid, as it exceeded the authority of Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged statutes barred disbursing industrial insurance permanent partial disability benefits to prisoners with no statutory beneficiaries and were unlikely to be released from prison. In addition to finding the statutes unconstitutional, trial court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 51.32.040(3)(a) and 72.60.102 worked a forfeiture of the prisoners' property contrary to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.92.110. The instant court determined that the challenged statutes did not conflict with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.92.110, but also concluded that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.32.040(3)(a), as applied to the prisoners by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 72.60.102, deprived them of due process.  Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.32.040(3)(a), as applied to prisoners by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 72.60.102, also violated equal protection. The challenged statutes conferred an advantage to prisoners with spouses, children, or dependents, not equally available to prisoners without these statutory beneficiaries.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a ruling of the Washington Court of Appeals that applied the doctrine of invited error to affirm defendant's conviction for interfering with a public officer in violation of Seattle, Wash., Mun. Code &sect; 12A.16.010.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in a jury trial in the Seattle Municipal Court. The &quot;to convict&quot; instruction given to jury was drafted by the defense. The instruction was defective under Abercrombie because it did not include the elements of &quot;actual obstruction&quot; and &quot;known public&quot; officer required to prove a violation of the ordinance beyond reasonable doubt. The court of appeals held that the instruction was defective but affirmed defendant's conviction on the grounds that the error was invited. The court agreed. Although the doctrine of invited error should be applied with caution in cases involving the failure of an instruction to include an essential element, the court affirmed its holding in Studd, and held that a party could not request an instruction at trial and then complain on appeal that the instruction was defective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer's written statement provided that the licensee's speed was determined by radar, and, according to the statement, the licensee accused the officer of stopping her because of her race. At the contested hearing, the licensee and her attorney appeared, along with the officer and the radar expert; no prosecutor appeared. The licensee argued that it was improper for the district court judge to act as a lawyer and judge in the same proceeding when it called and questioned the State's witnesses in the traffic infraction hearing without a prosecutor present, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.63.080(3). The reviewing court determined that it had jurisdiction over the licensee's constitutional claims and ruled that the district court did not violate the separation of powers doctrine or due process by adjudicating the licensee's traffic infraction hearing without a prosecutor present. In asking for both parties' evidence, listening to all of it, and deciding whether the infraction was committed, the district court was within the constitutional confines of the judicial power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were each convicted of engaging in &quot;upskirt voyeurism&quot; in which they would go to a shopping mall and take photographs while lying on the floor in an attempt to photograph the women's undergarments. Defendants each contended that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.115 was overbroad and vague, and that the statute did not criminalize upskirt photography in a public place. The appellate court found that the statute was neither unconstitutionally overbroad or vague, but did agree that the statute, as written, did not apply to actions done in a public place. The plain language of the statute clearly limited its scope to acts done in a place where the person against whom the acts were directed would have a reasonable expectation of privacy, not acts that personally invaded the victim's own right of privacy. The court noted that other states had avoided the problem by adopting different language, but, as written, &sect; 9A.44.115 simply did not criminalize defendants' conduct because a shopping mall was a public place where the women could not reasonably expect to be free from public surveillance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On January 9, 1995, the husband was injured when a car owned and operated by the county and driven by a county employee rear-ended the car the husband was driving.

On January 7, 1998, two days before the statute of limitations was to expire, petitioners filed a second claim with the county for personal injury damages and loss of consortium. Petitioners' filing of the claim commenced a 60-day waiting period before suing and tolled the statute of limitations for filing suit. The county denied the claim on January 13, 1998. On March 5, 1998, four days before the 60-day waiting period was to expire, petitioners filed the instant complaint in superior court. The instant court held that petitioners' failure to wait 60 days before filing a claim against the county in superior court violated Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.96.020(4). Petitioners' claims were separate, and each was subject to the requirements of &sect; 4.96.020(4). The statute was constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated case, petitioner children were taken to a hospital because of complaints of their strange and/or violent behavior. A designated mental health professionals (CDMHP) detained each child for 72-hour evaluation and treatment. Respondent State's petition for further involuntary detention was dismissed. The Washington Court of Appeals reversed and the children appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the children asserted that the appellate court erred in concluding that the six-hour time limit in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.05.050 did not begin until the hospital staff determined that an evaluation by the CDMHP was necessary. The supreme court determined that by its terms, &sect; 71.05.050 required several events to occur before the hospital staff could refer a person to the CDMHP and that the six-hour time limitation began to run when the staff determined that the statutory requirements were met. The supreme court also found that it was necessary to impose due process safeguards on the time between a person's arrival at the hospital and the staff's determination that referral to the CDMHP was necessary to protect against potential deprivation that might occur because of the lack of statutory time restraints on the time it took to evaluate a person. Because the children did not argue, nor could they, that the staff or the CDMHP disregarded the statutory requirements, dismissal was not the appropriate remedy, as two of the children contended. The supreme court concluded that dismissal was not usually the appropriate remedy for violations of &sect; 71.05.050.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In water quality certification cases, petitioner Washington Department of Ecology and respondent public utilities district sought review of summary judgment decisions of the Washington Pollution Control Hearings Board. The Pend Oreille County Superior Court, Washington, consolidated the petitions for review. The board issued a certificate of appealability. The department filed a motion for discretionary review, which the instant court granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue in this case was whether the department had the authority to condition a water quality certification under the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1251 et seq., on maintenance of minimum instream flows, where such conditions affected existing water rights. The case also involved issues concerning Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 90.03.380, the surface water statute governing changes in and transfers of water rights, and issues of abandonment and statutory forfeiture of water rights. In upholding the department's denial of a change in point of diversion of water under a 1980 inchoate water right, the instant court concluded that &sect; 90.03.380 required that water must have been applied to beneficial use before a change in point of diversion was authorized. The department could not deny a change application based upon public interest considerations. The water rights at issue were neither abandoned nor statutorily forfeited. The department had the authority to impose bypass flow conditions in a water quality certification regardless of whether the district, which sought to amend its federal license to allow it to generate hydroelectric power, had existing water rights that could be affected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board's decisions were affirmed in part and reversed in part. Its denial of the change application on the 1980 inchoate right was affirmed, as was its decision that the district had not abandoned its water right, and its decision that it had the authority to impose instream flow conditions under the Clean Water Act. Its decision that it had the authority to consider the public interest when considering a change application was reversed.</SPAN></P>
