<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile challenged the adjudication of the Coweta County Juvenile Court (Georgia), which found him delinquent for disrupting a public school, in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 20-2-1181.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support the adjudication. The court found that the evidence presented showed that the juvenile was a middle school student who was assigned to in-school suspension and that the paraprofessional assigned to the classroom testified that when the juvenile entered the room, he was very angry and belligerent. The paraprofessional testified that the juvenile failed to comply with her instructions and threw the papers off of the desk. The paraprofessional also testified that the other children were laughing at the juvenile's responses to her and that the juvenile's behavior was riling up the other students to the point that she could not control the classroom and it became disorderly. The court found no merit to the juvenile's contention that he could not have violated the statute because he did not disrupt the operation of the school as disrupting the classroom while school was in session was enough to clearly violate the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a medical malpractice action, a Georgia trial court denied summary judgment to appellant doctors, despite their assertion that: (1) the personal injury claims asserted against them were time-barred; and (2) appellee surviving spouse's wrongful death claim was barred by the statute of repose. The doctors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctors challenged the judgment entered against them, continuing to maintain that the personal injury claims asserted against them by the decedent's surviving spouse were time-barred and that the statute of repose barred the spouse's wrongful death claim. The appeals court disagreed as the undisputed evidence did not show that the decedent experienced any symptom of his subsequent injury before he found the lump in his neck on October 31, 2002. Because the suit was filed within two years after this symptom first appeared, the action was timely filed. Further, it was undisputed that the original complaint was filed within five years after the negligent or wrongful acts and omissions, and within two years after the resulting injury, and that the wrongful death claim was filed within two years after the decedent's death. As a result, the trial court properly found that the wrongful death claim was timely filed both in terms of the statute of repose and the statute of limitation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant resided with his girlfriend and the police had been called due to an argument between defendant and his girlfriend's daughter over the contents of one of the tapes. The girlfriend's daughter gave the police the videotape and defendant consented to the police viewing the video. Upon seeking defendant engage in a sexual act with a minor on the video, defendant was arrested. Subsequently, an additional video was found. The court upheld the denial of defendant's motion to suppress the videotapes since defendant consented to the police viewing the same and the girlfriend's daughter had given the one tape to the police. The court found that defendant failed to demonstrate any prejudice as a result of the failure to preserve the two videotapes for appellate review. Further, the court held that sufficient evidence existed to convict defendant based on the videotapes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a personal injury action, a Georgia trial court granted a motion for attorney fees pursuant to O.C.G.A. 9-11-68(d), the offer of settlement statute, filed by defendants, and denied plantiff's motion to declare the statute unconstitutional on procedural grounds. Thus, plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff challenged the judgment entered against her, arguing that the trial court erred in denying her motion to declare O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-11-68(d)&nbsp;unconstitutional based on her failure to serve the Attorney General with notice. The appeals court agreed, reasoning that no law on the statute books in Georgia, and none cited by counsel, required service upon the Attorney General pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect;&nbsp;9-4-7(c) in other than declaratory judgment proceedings. Given that plaintiff's challenge to the offer of settlement statute's constitutionality arose from her personal injury action, the trial court's denial of her challenge was erroneous. Furthermore, the appeals court was bound by the Supreme Court of Georgia's order, which transferred plaintiff's appeal, and expressly held that the trial court did not rule on whether O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-11-68(d) was constitutional. Thus, the instant court could not consider the defendants' arguments that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Georgia trial court dismissed a renewed medical malpractice complaint upon a motion filed by a hospital, prompting the suing patient to appeal to the Supreme Court of Georgia. The appeal was then transferred to the instant court, and the hospital then moved to dismiss the same upon the patient's failure to timely file her appellate brief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Since the Supreme Court of Georgia transferred the patient's appeal to the instant court without adverse action upon her untimely filed appellate brief, the court considered such brief. In doing so, the patient contended that the trial court erred in granting the hospital's motion to dismiss upon the finding that: (i) that her pending chapter 13 bankruptcy did not stay the running of the medical malpractice statute of repose, and, in the alternative, (ii) the medical statute of repose was unconstitutionally vague. Upon a review of the relevant law, the court found that the pendency of the patient''s bankruptcy petition did not operate to toll the medical malpractice statute of repose. Thus, that statute extinguished the patient's cause of action on July 30, 2004. Further, because the patient filed her renewed complaint two years after the cause of action was extinguished, the grant of the hospital's motion to dismiss was not error on this account. Finally, the patient's alternate claim of error on constitutional grounds was waived, as such was raised for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to dismiss the appeal was denied, and the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon a review of the evidence, the appeals court first considered whether the city could be held liable. After considering the doctrine of sovereign immunity, and whether the city waived such, the court found that the city waived their immunity to the extent the city purchased liability coverage to cover the officer's actions in operating his police car. Second, in addressing whether the officer was enjoyed official or qualified immunity from suit. After reviewing the facts in light of the relevant case law, the court concluded that the circumstances surrounding the officer's actions constituted an emergency in that a hazardous condition needed to be quickly eliminated. Specifically, the officer was performing a discretionary, not ministerial, function when he decided to rush to his assignment at the crossing intersection to direct the traffic. And, he acted without any actual malice or actual intent to injure in doing so. Thus, such immunized his actions under the doctrine of official immunity. Finally, because O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6-6(d)(2) did not apply, the trial court erred in applying such as a ground for granting summary judgment to the city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment in the city's favor was reversed. But, summary judgment as to the officer was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that there was sufficient evidence that the cause of the child's deprivation was likely to continue. The evidence showed that the mother's instability and mental health problems rendered her unable to care for her older children. She failed to consistently seek mental health treatment, to take her medication, or to maintain stable housing. She had no bond with the child and did not visit the child regularly or support her financially. She showed progress in securing housing, taking her medication, and seeing a therapist only after the termination petition was filed. Moreover, she was still living with an aunt and spending time at a motel at the time of the hearing, and she admitted that she took her medication only when she had it available. Next, even if the trial court mislabeled the mother's diagnosis as schizophrenia rather than schizoaffective disorder, the evidence showed that the mother had significant mental health problems and did not consistently follow treatment. Finally, even if the mother had not waived her due process and equal protection claims, the evidence showed that she understood the case plan and could have completed it but did not do so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A decedent's administrator filed a personal injury and wrongful death suit against appellants, a deputy sheriff, a sheriff, and a county, after the decedent was struck and killed by a patrol car being operated by the deputy. The Pickens Superior Court (Georgia) denied appellants' motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. Appellants sought interlocutory review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that the sheriff's department was a state agency and that it and its employees were thus subject to the Georgia Tort Claims Act (GTCA), O.C.G.A. &sect; 50-21-20 et seq. The court stated that under Ga. Const. art. IX, &sect; I, para. III(a), sheriffs were county officers. Furthermore, the definition of &quot;State&quot; in O.C.G.A. &sect; 50-21-22(5) specifically excluded counties. Moreover, the county here paid the salaries of the sheriff and his employees, provided their employment benefits, and funded the sheriff's department. Thus, the GTCA did not apply. Next, the sheriff and the deputy were not entitled to summary judgment on the claims against them in their official capacity because under O.C.G.A. &sect; 33-24-51, they could be held liable to the extent that the county waived its sovereign immunity by the purchase of automobile liability insurance. The county, however, should have been granted summary judgment because it could not be held vicariously liable for the deputy's alleged negligence. The sheriff, not the county, was liable for the deputy's alleged misconduct. Finally, there was a jury issue as to whether the deputy's patrol of the area was a ministerial or a discretionary act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's denial of summary judgment to the county. It affirmed the remainder of the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>

The power company initiated the action by filing an action under the Special Master Act, O.C.G.A. &sect; 22-2-100 et seq., seeking to condemn an easement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On July 28, 2005, the special master made an award of $ 14, 956.00 to the property owner as the fair market value of the condemned easement. That award was filed with the trial court on July 29, 2005. On that same day, the property owner's attorney called the special master's office to ask whether the award had been filed. The special master's secretary indicated she was not sure. No follow-up was made and, after receiving a faxed copy of the award on August 10, 2005, the property owner filed his appeal the next day. The power company successfully obtained a dismissal of the appeal as untimely based on the 10-day time limit set forth in O.C.G.A. &sect; 22-2-112. On appeal, the property owner argued that the 10-day time for filing an appeal cannot begin to run until after a party has been served with the award because any other interpretation of the statute would violate the constitutional guarantee of due process. The court disagreed and held that due process included constructive notice and that the filing of an award pursuant to &sect; 22-2-112 provided such notice. The court also noted that neither the special master nor the court was obligated to serve the parties with the award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court dismissing the property owner's untimely appeal of the special master's award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions, and the order denying him a new trial, asserting that the trial court erred in (1) denying his constitutional challenge to O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-12-100(d); (2) failing to inquire into his decision not to testify; (3) denying his challenge to the composition of the grand jury; and (4) denying his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The appeals court disagreed. First, defendant's failed to timely raise his constitutional challenge, and was thus barred from raising such on appeal. In addition, as the photographs at issue were available for inspection, the defense was offered a mirror image of defendant's hard drive, and counsel never requested a copy of defendant's digital camera card, his assertion that the trial court erred in failing to compel discovery was meritless. Second, defendant failed to support his claim of error regarding his decision not to testify, and thus has abandoned the same. Third, defendant's challenge to the grand jury composition failed because it was waived and the grand jury was properly comprised. Finally, all of defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims as to the way counsel handled the trial lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court also found that she waived her constitutional claims and that her challenge to the order denying her summary judgment was untimely. Third, her claim that the findings of fact set forth in the trial court's order differed from those in the transcript and resulted from an unconstitutional, out-of-court, ex parte reconsideration between the publisher's attorney and the judge was belied by the record. However, as to the order granting the publisher attorney's fees, because said order failed to specify the statutory basis for the award and there was no testimony as to the reasonableness of the fees, the award had to be vacated and remanded for an evidentiary hearing, followed by a judgment explaining the statutory basis for the award.</SPAN></P>

The court found no reversible error since by presenting evidence from an audit supervisor from the Commission explaining the practice and economic structure of payday lending, and providing affidavits from three customers describing the transactions that they engaged in with appellants, the State proved that the businesses charged a 25 to 27 percent fee, which amounted to an annual percentage rate of 650 to 702 percent on each loan.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court disagreed with the first claim, as evidence directly from the female victim supported both venue and the other elements of each offense. Next, after considering the well-established body of law on the subject, the trial court did not err in its jury charge directing the jury that a victim younger than 16 was legally incapable of consenting to intercourse. Finally, the record contained sufficient evidence of both aggravated child molestation and aggravated sodomy for a the trier of fact to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of both crimes charged, and the evidence supporting one count was not &quot;used up&quot; in proving the other count.</SPAN></P>

Hence, the evidence also supported the incest conviction. Second, the similar transaction evidence was admitted for a proper purpose to show a course of conduct, bent of mind, and lustful disposition, and a sufficient similarity between the acts and the crime charged existed. Also, testimony from the victim provided a sufficient link between the videotapes and the charged crime of enticing a minor for indecent purposes. Finally, the fact that a prior conviction subjected defendant to an increased punishment in the wake of his conviction did not somehow convert O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-4 (b) into an unconstitutional ex post facto law. Instead, the statute punished future offenses, and said punishment was rationally enhanced by the prior conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2000, defendant, a first offender, entered an Alford plea to charges of aggravated child molestation and sexual battery. In 2005, defendant filed a motion for an order stating that he was not subject to the sex offender registration requirement of O.C.G.A. &sect; 42-1-12 that was imposed in 2005. A Georgia trial court denied the motion and ordered defendant to register as a sex offender. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first noted that it had rejected the argument that the registration requirement imposed in 2005 did not apply to convictions entered before that time. The 2005 amendment to the statute had struck a limitation on the retroactivity of the registration requirement. Next, the Supreme Court of Georgia had upheld the mandate of O.C.G.A. &sect; 42-1-13 that any convicted child molester who continued to reside within 1,000 feet of any area where children congregated would be guilty of a felony. Because such a person's failure to abide by the statute would give rise to a new crime, the statute was not retrospective and therefore was not an ex post facto law. The same rationale applied to O.C.G.A. &sect; 42-1-12, under which defendant would be guilty of a felony entirely distinct from those of which he had been convicted in 2000 if he failed to register as a sex offender. Thus, the trial court did not err when it ordered defendant to register as a sex offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on information from defendant-B regarding a victim's possession of marijuana, defendant-A and another other man went to the victim's home, smashed a sliding glass door with the butt of a gun carried by defendant-A, and entered. They forced the victim to the ground, demanded the marijuana, and struck the victim in the head. A struggle ensued, whereupon the victim grabbed his shotgun and it discharged, firing a shot into defendant-A. Defendant-A and the other man fled to defendant-B's home. Evidence at trial included a 911 recording regarding defendant-A's gunshot wound and testimony from a niece of defendants regarding the intention to rob the victim. Defendants were convicted after a jury trial, and they appealed. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions of defendant-A, and of defendant-B under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-2-20(4). The denial of defendant-A's request for new counsel for purposes of appeal was based on the policy of the public defender's office, and there was no waiver of any purported error, as it could have been raised in a habeas corpus proceeding.

The court found that, even if the hearsay testimony was wrongfully admitted under Crawford and defendant's trial counsel was deficient for failing to object, defendant failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced as a result. Defendant failed to show that the outcome of the trial would have been different had his attorney objected. The court further found that the trial court did not err by imposing a 20 year sentence, to serve 15 years, after defendant exercised his right to a jury trial and chose not to plead guilty because the sentence imposed was permitted by O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 16-7-60(c) and 17-10-7(a) and (c), with defendant taking the risk of his four prior felony convictions being taken into account and finding him a recidivist.</SPAN></P>

A neighbor noticed defendant and the others in the home and called police, who found defendant and his companions. On appeal, defendant asserted that the evidence against him was insufficient to support the conviction. However, the court found that, via testimony from defendant's wife and the two friends, that once defendant found the cocaine in the house, he not only took possession of the cocaine but also used some of the drug. Additionally, during defendant's own testimony, defendant admitted that he did not dispose of the cocaine. Further, the weight of the cocaine in the bag found in the bedroom where defendant was arrested, combined with that of the cocaine which defendant provided to one of the wife's friends, exceeded 28 grams. No sentencing error was shown as defendant was able to speak freely to the trial judge at the punishment phase.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital authority (hospital) challenged the judgment entered, first contending that appellee husband and wife waived objections to the transfer of the case to Gwinnett County by failing to appeal the Fulton County trial court's transfer order and continuing to litigate the case after it was transferred to Gwinnett County through entering into a consent order, filing motions in limine, and participating in discovery. The appeals court disagreed. The evidence showed that the husband and wife did not acquiesce in the transfer of the case to Gwinnett County, and the hospital failed to show how the husband and wife waived the issue when they failed to pursue an interlocutory appeal. Second, the husband and wife were not to be denied a remedy merely because there was no specific procedural mechanism to address their grievance. Finally, the Gwinnett County trial court's transfer order was not erroneous despite the fact that the statute that the court relied upon was later found to be unconstitutional. Rather, the result was that the case was to be tried in the original forum, which the hospital did not show was substantively prejudicial to its defense.</SPAN></P>

The trial court judgment was affirmed. The child's statements to a neighbor and a psychotherapist showed that rapes occurred during the time period set out in the indictment. Evidence that defendant knew the child was being raped, told her to lie to investigators, failed to protect her children from contact with the man, helped him obtain release from jail, and allowed him to move into her home supported the finding that she affirmatively encouraged the rapes and acted as a party to them. She failed to show a reasonable probability that but for her counsel's failure to present a battered woman syndrome defense, the trial's result would have been different. Testimony about the child's statements was properly admitted under O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-3-16. Evidence that the child suffered excessive mental pain was sufficient to support the conviction for cruelty to children.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the cross-appeal, the appeals court agreed that the two-year statute of limitation in O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-3-71(a) expired on the medical malpractice claims related to misdiagnosis, as the record showed that the patient suffered an injury arising out of the misdiagnosis in January of 1999, when she was first seen by the doctor manifesting continuous symptoms of a moderate B-12 deficiency and he failed to make the diagnosis and provide treatment. The fact that she did not know the medical cause of these symptoms, and the fact that these symptoms worsened and resulted in permanent disability, did not lead to a different result, as the subsequent disability was directly related to the initial symptoms and misdiagnosis. Second, the trial court properly granted summary judgment dismissing the ordinary negligence and breach of fiduciary claims. The ordinary negligence claim essentially was a medical malpractice claim related to the misdiagnosis, and the claim that the doctor breached a fiduciary duty by failing to inform the patient about her B-12 deficiency stated a claim for medical malpractice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the trial court (Georgia), entered after a jury trial, that convicted him of three counts of aggravated assault under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-5-21(a)(2) after he allegedly pointed a gun out of his car window at a woman and three children in a car that he believed was following his car too closely. The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the charges based on the postponement of his arraignment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. Victim testimony sufficiently supported the convictions and the resolution of defendant's self-defense claim against him. A judicial procedure by which the district attorney calendared the arraignment did not unconstitutionally delegate judicial powers or violate due process. Defendant waived his challenges to a subpoena directing him to produce his gun. The trial court did not violate O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-8-57 by interrupting cross-examination or repeating an instruction, and no charge on witness immunity was required. No improper jury communications out of the presence of defendant or his counsel were shown to have occurred. An objection to closing argument was waived, and the trial court properly interrupted defense counsel's closing to ask him not to stray into irrelevant matters. O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-7-91 did not require a fixed date for the arraignment. Defendant waived his objection to an error in the indictment. His plea in abatement was properly denied because he did not show that men were discriminated against in composing the grand jury. The trial court's evidentiary rulings were correct, and the prosecutor did not misrepresent the availability of a witness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court judgment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the sheriff was a county employee and the judge was a state employee for purposes of workers compensation (WC).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge was murdered in his courtroom, and his widow filed suit against defendants, the county sheriff and multiple deputy sheriffs. She asserted that the sheriffs had failed to carry out their ministerial duties. The sheriff sought dismissal on the ground that the action was barred by the WC exclusive remedy available under O.C.G.A. &sect;&nbsp;34-9-11(a). The trial court held that the sheriff was an employee of the county and the judge was an employee of the State of Georgia. It was noted that the widow was receiving workers compensation survivor's benefits from the State. On appeal, the court found that although the county alleged that the judge's widow was entitled to WC benefits and it offered to pay his funeral expenses, neither type of funding was accepted by the widow and those actions did not make the judge a county employee. Rather, he was a state employee pursuant to authority of Ga. Const. art. 6, &sect; 1, para. 1 and O.C.G.A. &sect;&nbsp;45-7-4(a)(20). Further, the sheriff was clearly a county employee under Ga. Const. art. 9, &sect; 1, para. 3. The trial court did not err in finding that the county could not provide WC benefits to the judge.</SPAN></P>

She told the officer that she had consumed about 19 beers the previous night. Another officer observed that defendant's eyes were glossy and that the smell of alcohol in the hospital room became more pronounced as she approached defendant. Defendant was read her implied consent rights and informed of her Miranda rights. She was not arrested until later. The appellate court held that the victim was seriously injured under &sect; 40-5-55(c) and that the officers had probable cause based on defendant's statements, her glossy eyes, and the odor of alcohol on her person to believe that she was DUI. The officer was not required to arrest defendant before the reading of implied consent. The consent to the blood test was valid, and the denial of the suppression motion was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Georgia trial court granted a protective order to appellee, the Department of Community Health (Department), barring further discovery in an action filed by appellant consultant. The court also held that the Department was protected under the doctrine of sovereign immunity from being sued in the consultant's action and that the General Assembly had not waived that sovereign immunity. The consultant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consultant contended that the trial court erred in (i) deciding its case pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), (ii) finding that sovereign immunity protected state agencies in declaratory judgment actions; and (iii) finding that the Department's rules regarding health benefits could not be challenged. The appeals court found that the issue of sovereign immunity was raised by the Department and that such required the trial court to address this matter pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 50-13-10 of the APA. Because it was only under &sect; 50-13-10 that the State specifically consented to be sued and had waived its sovereign immunity as to declaratory judgment actions in which its agency's rules were challenged, the trial court did not err in finding that the APA governed and that sovereign immunity barred any further discovery. In light of this, and given the fact that the consultant did not comply with that statute in filing its action, the trial court was without the jurisdiction necessary to take any action beyond granting the Department's protective order staying discovery, including declaring that the Department's rules regarding health benefits could not be challenged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order granting the protective order was upheld. Insofar as the trial court held that the Department's rule could not be challenged, that part of the judgment was vacated, and the matter was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment entered against her. However, in her appellate brief, she conceded that she raised the constitutional issues central to her claim for the first time in an amended motion for new trial. As a result, Ga. Comp. R. &amp; Regs. 92-3-.06(12)(b) was first attacked following the trial court's adjudication of guilt. It thus followed that defendant's challenge was not preserved for appellate review. In addition, because the regulation was duly promulgated under the Georgia Administrative Procedure Act, O.C.G.A. &sect; 50-13-1 et seq., defendant had an alternative remedy.  Finally, even if the constitutional challenge had been timely raised, the instant court would have rejected it, given that Ga. Comp. R. &amp; Regs. 92-3-.06(12)(b) prohibited no conduct which could be interpreted as protected activity under the due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions. Moreover, defendant failed to demonstrate that the Division of Forensic Sciences (DFS) eliminated meaningful procedures for conducting breath tests when it promulgated the rule, and the techniques and methods approved by the DFS were sufficient to ensure fair and accurate testing.</SPAN></P>

The doctor argued that, under O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-9-67.1, the witness was not qualified to testify against the doctor since the witness was a vascular surgeon and the doctor was an orthopedic surgeon. The appellate court disagreed. The witness did not allege that the doctor was negligent in his performance of the total knee replacement surgery, only in his failure to assess the vascular issues involved, particularly in light of the patient's medical history. Therefore, the evidence supported the trial court's determination that the area of practice in which the opinion was to be given was vascular surgery, which was the witness's specialty, and that the witness was qualified to give an opinion in that area.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Clayton County State Court (Georgia) granted dismissal of plaintiff administratrix's medical and nursing malpractice action to defendants, a hospital, its parent corporation, a doctor, and a nurse, based on her failure to timely file an expert's affidavit. But, that order, as against the hospital, was vacated and the administratrix was authorized to add the decedent's children as parties. The hospital appealed from said ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court first found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in vacating its initial order dismissing the complaint for failure to timely file an expert's affidavit. Although not styled as a wrongful death action, the original complaint pled that the hospital's negligence caused the decedent's death and sought judgment against it in excess of $ 10,000 for all damages recoverable by law. Moreover, the administratrix properly amended the complaint to reflect that she brought the action, not only in her capacity as the administratrix of the decedent's estate, but also as next friend of the decedent's minor children. Thus, there could be no prejudice to the hospital from the amendment adding the new parties. Further, as the decedent's children reached their majority after the complaint was filed, they were properly added as real parties in interest. Finally, since the 45-day grace period under former O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-11-9.1(b) was constitutionally required, the administratrix was entitled to the benefit of its provisions.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court disagreed. First, sufficient evidence established the reliability of the child's statement. Also, admission was harmless, as the child victims each testified about the incident and defendant was acquitted of an aggravated child molestation charge. Second, any claim of a Brady violation was waived. Additionally, it lacked merit, as the complained of evidence was inculpatory; the statements impeaching the evidence were known to defendant prior to trial; and he had an opportunity to cross-examine the victims. Third, any error in refusing to grant a mistrial was harmless. Finally, the mere fact that the State's expert witness was not a licensed psychologist did not affect the admissibility of her testimony, as Georgia law carved out an exception to the licensing requirements for those practicing under supervision in order to obtain a license.</SPAN></P>

A mile or two before the Firebird reached the site for the drug transaction, police pulled the car over for a possible window-tint violation. During the stop, a drug dog alerted to the console of the car, where a gun and drugs were found. In the trial court's order, the trial court found probable cause based, in part, on the discovery of contraband in the vehicle. The appellate court found that it was unclear whether the trial court would have reached the same result absent this factor. A search could not have been validated simply because contraband was discovered during the search. Thus, the trial court's order in this regard was improper. The trial court never ruled on whether consent had been validly obtained and actually questioned the officer's credibility in this regard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In cases consolidated for appeal, appellant surety sought remission of bond forfeitures involving four separate criminal defendants.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The surety executed bonds for each criminal defendant. Each defendant failed to appear for a court hearing and was eventually arrested by local law enforcement officials after judgment was entered against the surety on its forfeited bonds. The appellate court found that, since the surety did not pay the judgments, O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-6-72(d)(3), allowing reduction, rather than O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-6-72(d)(1), allowing remission, controlled. Thus, the surety was obligated to show that it had surrendered each principal to law enforcement authorities within 120 days of the judgment. But the record showed that the individuals were all arrested by county authorities without any involvement of the surety. While the trial court apparently misapprehended the requirements of O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-6-72(d)(3), this error was harmless, since the record clearly showed that the higher threshold findings of O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-6-72(d)(3) were not proven. The surety's challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 17-6-72(d)(1) was not raised below, and should have been addressed to the Supreme Court of Georgia.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court held he waived the objection by not raising it in his new trial motion. The appellate court held this ruling bound it. Similar transaction evidence was properly admitted, under Ga. Unif. Super. Ct. 31.3(B), as, in one case, defendant called the complaining witness, and, in the other case, he did not object that the prior transaction was not sufficiently similar, waiving appellate objection. He waived a confrontation clause objection. He did not raise counsel's alleged inadequate preparation in a new trial motion, or at the hearing on the motion, waiving the issue. The fact counsel did not interview a similar transaction victim's mother was not deficient, as she refused to give a pre-trial statement. The State's summation responded to specific defense claims, so counsel was not ineffective for not making a futile objection to it. It was not deficient to call a witness in the hope the jury would find her testimony, including accusations against defendant, incredible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said the evidence was insufficient. The appellate court held evidence his dogs ran loose and were repeatedly found loose supported convictions for not restraining an animal and letting an animal become a public nuisance. A prior &quot;at large&quot; incident was relevant to the public nuisance charge and admissible as a prior difficulty between defendant and his neighbor. It was admissible in this strict liability case to show course of conduct or bent of mind. Police reports on his trespass complaints were inadmissible hearsay. Counsel was not ineffective for (1) not subpoenaing the authors of the inadmissible reports, as this was trial strategy, (2) not calling defendant's wife, as counsel interviewed her and found her testimony irrelevant, and (3) not filing a special demurrer to the indictment, as defendant could have been recharged more specifically. The nuisance crime was complete before the failure to restrain, so they did not merge for sentencing. The Georgia Indigent Defense Act of 2003, O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-12-1 et seq., did not authorize reimbursement of appointed counsel's fees, so this part of defendant's sentence was erroneous.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that it was unable to take judicial notice of the transportation rules of the Public Service Commission (PSC), as those rules had not become effective under the APA and were not part of the record. Contrary to the State's argument, defendant did not waive his challenge to judicial notice of the PSC rules by not making that challenge in the trial court. The State referred to the rules at the hearing on the motion to suppress, but did not ask the trial court to take judicial notice of them, and the trial court never indicated any intention to do so.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After remand from the federal court of the state law claims filed by appellant driver arising out of a traffic stop and arrest conducted by appellee deputy sheriff (deputy) for a tag light violation and obstruction of an officer, the Coweta County trial court (Georgia) granted the deputy's motion for summary judgment. The court also denied the driver's motion for default judgment. The driver appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver challenged the judgment entered, first contending that the trial court erred in denying his motion for default judgment. The appeals court disagreed. While he objected to the trial court's consideration of the deputy's answer as evidence, he did not object on the ground he asserted on appeal. As such, his claim has been waived and presented no basis for reversal on appeal. The driver next argued that it was error to grant summary judgment on his state law claims. Again, the appeals court disagreed. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals expressly ruled that the deputy had probable cause for the traffic stop and arrest based upon a tag light violation, had probable cause for arrest based upon the driver's acts of obstruction, and had not used excessive force in making the arrest. Thus, under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, the appeals court was compelled to hold that the issues as to the lawfulness of the deputy's actions, probable cause, and excessive force - which were decided adversely to the driver in the federal court action - could not be relitigated. Further, there was no evidence to support his remaining claims.</SPAN></P>

The owner asserted that the board was an agency within the department. The appellate court disagreed. The legislature did not intend for community service boards to be part of the department, or its employees to be department employees, under ordinary circumstances. The legislature authorized community service boards to negotiate and contract with the department to provide services, language indicating that the service boards and the department were distinct, separate entities. More importantly, the legislature further provided that, if a particular community service board was unable to carry out its duties, the department director was to have assumed responsibility for the administration and operation of the board's programs. The general assembly outlined in detail the structure, responsibilities, and powers of the community service boards. Within that outline, it specified that a service board program, as well as its employees and assets, became part of the department only if the board was unable to carry out its responsibilities.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held the jury's finding rejecting defendant's claim was not insupportable as a matter of law because it could find defendant's negligence proximately caused the death, despite other factors. When, after the incident, he was given an implied consent advisement, under O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-5-55(a), and then, four hours later, his statement was taken, the statement was admissible because the advisement and resulting seizure of his blood sample was not improper, given probable cause to think that he drove under the influence, and, given the amount of time between the advisement and the statement and the fact that different officers were involved, any illegality in the advisement was attenuated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police found counterfeit checks, credit cards, and other evidence in defendant's residence. On appeal, defendant first argued that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress the evidence based on an improper search warrant affidavit. The appellate court held that although the affidavit contained false information, the remainder of the affidavit established probable cause for the warrant. Defendant also argued that the nine counts of financial transaction card theft should have been merged into two crimes. The appellate court found that each card was distinct and bore a different number or expiration date, so it was not error to charge defendant with a separate count for each card. Defendant argued that venue for the charge of identity fraud, O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-9-121, was not proper. Under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-9-125, venue for identity fraud was proper in the county in which the victim resided or in which any part of the offense took place. The trial was held in the county in which defendant resided. There was no evidence as to where the victim resided or as to how or where defendant obtained the card. Thus, the court held that venue was not proven as to the identity fraud charge.</SPAN></P>

The victim's cousin testified that she did not believe that the victim was lying. The appellate court held that the trial court took remedial measured to ensure that defendant received a fair trial by giving a generalized instruction concerning the improper bolstering of another witness's credibility. Thus, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a mistrial under O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-9-80. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred when it permitted the State to introduce the testimony of the victim under the provisions of the child hearsay statute,&nbsp;O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-3-16, despite the State's failure to prove the reliability of the testimony. The victim was made available for cross-examination, and therefore the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony.

The trial court (Georgia) granted summary judgment to defendants, and the authority appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Service Delivery Act, O.C.G.A. &sect; 36-70-20 et seq., the county and cities entered into an agreement to implement a local government service delivery strategy. The authority argued that the agreement improperly reduced the territory granted to the authority. On appeal, the authority claimed that because it was established as a separate political subdivision, a local action by defendants could not take precedence over the authority's creating legislation. The appellate court held that the service agreement did not purport to modify the authority's creating legislation. The service agreement also did not prohibit the authority from providing services within its project area. Rather, the Act forbade the issuance of any state administered financial assistance or grant, loan, or permit to any local government or authority for a project which was inconsistent with a verified service delivery strategy, O.C.G.A. &sect; 36-70-27(a). Thus the authority, to the extent it relied on any state-administered financial assistance or grant, loan, or permit, might not be able to complete a project outside the service area designated by the service agreement.</SPAN></P>

She alleged the doctor failed to tell her of this diagnosis and did not suggest any further treatment. Annual mammograms showed no change in condition until three years later, when it was discovered she had developed invasive breast cancer that had metastasized to her lymph nodes. The trial court held that the limitations period of &sect; 9-3-71(a) began to run when the doctor failed to tell her she had DCIS and failed to recommend appropriate treatment. The appellate court disagreed. When a problem was misdiagnosed or improperly treated and later developed into a new medical condition, the limitations period did not begin to run until the patient experienced symptoms of the new condition. As the patient's invasive cancer was a different disease than the DCIS, and a jury issue existed as to when the cancer developed and metastasized and whether she had any symptoms of it more than two years before she filed suit, the trial court erred in finding as a matter of law that plaintiffs' claims were time-barred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to aggravated stalking and attempting to elude a police officer. Defendant's probation was revoked and he was sentenced to 10 years to serve in prison and five years on probation. The Georgia Sentence Review Panel reduced defendant's prison sentence to five years, followed by 10 years on probation. The State's appeal of the denial of its motion to set aside the new sentence was transferred by the Georgia Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the reduction order was void as the statutory scheme permitting the reduction of sentences was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that the state's highest court's conclusion that it could not reach the constitutional challenge was binding. Defendant was sentenced to 15 years and thus came within the ambit of O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-6(a), even though defendant was to serve five years on probation. The statute referred expressly to &quot;sentence(s) of 12 or more years,&quot; rather than imprisonments of 12 or more years. Thus, defendant's 15-year sentence was subject to review. As the statute was not ambiguous, the plain language prevailed over the caption in determining legislative intent. Finally, defendant initially was sentenced as a First Offender. Pursuant to Ga. Super. Ct. Sentence Rev. Panel R. 5, if a First Offender Act sentence was revoked and a sentence of 12 or more years was imposed, that sentence was reviewable even if the original First Offender Act sentence had already been reviewed by the Georgia Superior Court Sentence Review Panel. The State's claim that the sentence was not be subject to review as it followed a probation revocation was rejected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the trial court (Georgia) for selling cocaine. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole. His trial counsel moved for a new trial, which his later-appointed appellate counsel amended to include a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. His new trial motion was denied. No appeal was filed. Eight years later, new appellate counsel successfully moved for an out-of-time appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in complying with a juror's request that defendant stand before the jury before they watched a video of a drug transaction a second time. The appellate court held that the trial court did not express its opinion as to defendant's guilt, the juror did not direct any questions to defendant, and defendant's right against self-incrimination was not violated. It was presumed that defendant failed to show ineffective assistance of counsel as there was no transcript of the new trial hearing. Further, defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel. Three prior sale-of-cocaine convictions were properly considered for purposes of O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-7(c). It was not error to stack two recidivist sentencing provisions. Defendant lacked standing to challenge the failure to impose parole. Defendant's due process rights were not violated by the lack of a speedy appeal. Defendant failed to raise the issue below, and there was no evidence that the eight-year delay in filing the notice of appeal was due to the State or to defendant's counsel. Finally, defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced by the delay as his appeal was without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of an order from the Superior Court of Fulton County (Georgia), which affirmed a final decision of an administrative law judge (ALJ). The ALJ affirmed the decision of the Environmental Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (EPD) that denied the city's application for an additional groundwater withdrawal permit (GWP).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city was violating its existing GWP, and it entered a consent order with the EPD to take steps to prevent future violations. An order and judgment enforcing the consent order was entered and affirmed on appeal. Thereafter, the EPD received an additional application from the city for a second GWP, which was denied based on the city's required actions under the consent order. On the city's challenge to that denial, the ALJ granted the EPD's motion for summary determination, which constituted a final decision pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 12-2-2(c)(2). The trial court affirmed the decision by operation of law when it did not issue an order within 30 days of the judicial review hearing, pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 12-2-1(c). On further review, the court found that denial of the application was proper pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 12-4-96(d) of the Ground-water Use Act of 1972, O.C.G.A. &sect; 12-5-90 et seq. There was no requirement that every factor was to be considered, and the issues raised by the city as to which factors should have been taken into account lacked merit. Various arguments were not properly argued in the administrative matter, and the ALJ's decision was not clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A delinquency petition was filed in the juvenile court (Georgia) alleging that 13-year-old defendant, a juvenile had violated the fornication statute,&nbsp;O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-18, by having sexual intercourse with her 17-year-old step-brother.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the Supreme Court of Georgia had declared O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-18&nbsp;unconstitutional. The appellate court disagreed. Contrary to the trial court's ruling, the Supreme Court of Georgia did not strike down the fornication statute as unconstitutional, but rather reversed a juvenile court adjudication of delinquency for an alleged violation of &sect; 16-6-18 because the statute, under the circumstances of that case, infringed on the juvenile's state constitutional right of privacy.  Critical to that decision was the fact that the juvenile and his girlfriend were both 16 years old at the time they had sexual intercourse. In the instant case, that critical element was missing because defendant was only 13 years old at the time of the alleged sexual intercourse. Thus, she did not have the legal capacity to decide whether to engage in sexual intercourse. Because that critical element of being legally able to consent was missing in this case, the sexual conduct in question was not protected by the state constitutional right to privacy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the trial court (Georgia) of possessing illegal gambling devices in violation of the Georgia Video Poker Act of 2001, O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-12-20 et seq., following the denial of his motions to suppress, in limine, and in arrest of judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the Act did not prohibit possession of video gambling machines. The appellate court held that the possession of machines designed for gambling purposes was illegal. The trial court had probable cause to issue a search warrant for the warehouse. The affidavit stated that Clayton County investigators had purchased an illegal video poker machine from a subject in Clayton County, who said he obtained the machine from an address in DeKalb County. Both DeKalb and Clayton investigators observed &quot;several other illegal video poker machines&quot; at that address. Thus, there was a fair probability that contraband would be found. The trial court properly charged the jury that gambling devices were unlawful even if they were played for amusement purposes and that the State did not have to prove their actual operation. Finally, the motion in limine seeking to prevent the State's witnesses from testifying that the machines seized were &quot;gambling devices&quot; was properly denied. The description did not answer the ultimate issues of whether defendant sold a machine to a witness, who then sold it to the detectives, and whether that machine was illegal under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-12-20(2).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff attorneys brought a class action suit against defendant city to recover occupation taxes paid to the city. There were two classes. Class I members had not claimed a refund from the city under O.C.G.A. &sect; 48-5-380. Class II members had made such claims. The attorneys appealed from Georgia trial court orders on their motions for attorney's fees, partial money judgment, and amendment of class certification. The city cross appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">O.C.G.A. &sect; 48-5-380 applied to &quot;any&quot; tax levied by a municipal governing authority, including an &quot;illegal collection,&quot; so class I members were required to make a pre-litigation claim for a refund before bringing suit. Being part of a class action did not excuse that requirement. The class action attorneys did not have authority to make the claim against the city for class I since the trial court did not authorize it to do so. Therefore, the class action attorneys' claim was not sufficient to establish a pre-litigation refund claim by class I for purposes of &sect; 48-5-380 and class I was not entitled to a refund as a result of the class action. The members of class II were entitled to a refund since they made the requisite &sect; 48-5-380 claims. The class action attorneys were entitled to fees only against the recovery for class II members. Class I members did not have a sufficient opportunity to reject inclusion in the class action so they could not be considered to have been unjustly enriched by the suit's outcome. The suit had established that attorneys did not have to pay the occupation tax since it was an unconstitutional encroachment on the powers of the judicial branch.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of five counts of armed robbery, O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-8-41, and three counts of aggravated assault, O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-5-21. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment. Defendant filed a petition for declaratory judgment, asking the trial court (Georgia) to find his sentence illegal and void. The trial court denied the petition. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued the denial of his petition should have been reversed because the trial court did not specifically address each of his arguments in the petition and did not articulate any legal reasoning or precedent, other than finding that the sentences were authorized. The appellate court found that defendant failed to cite to any authority to support his contention on appeal, and it was deemed abandoned. The record on appeal did not contain any document or evidence to support defendant's contentions on appeal. Defendant thus failed to support his claims regarding the trial court's bias and the absence of aggravating circumstances to support his life sentence. Defendant's argument that the trial court was not authorized to sentence him to life imprisonment because he was not a recidivist failed. This issue had been resolved against him in a Supreme Court of Georgia case which found that a trial court was authorized to sentence a defendant to life imprisonment for armed robbery, even when the defendant was not a recidivist. Defendant was not eligible to be sentenced as a first offender because such treatment was not available for a conviction for armed robbery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that an odor of burnt marijuana in his truck did not authorize a search. The appellate court held that the officer had probable cause for the search as the officer's training and experience qualified him to detect the odor of marijuana. Defendant's attempt to distinguish between the odor of &quot;burnt&quot; marijuana and &quot;burning&quot; marijuana was rejected. Defendant's claim based on the seatbelt statute was rejected as it was not raised below. Further, the officer did not base his search of the truck on the seatbelt violation; the search was specifically to seek marijuana because after approaching the truck during a seatbelt stop, the officer smelled a &quot;very&quot; strong odor of marijuana. Finally, the officer did not exceed the scope of his initial traffic stop. The officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion when he smelled the &quot;very&quot; strong odor of marijuana coming from the truck. The conflict between defendant's answers to the officer's questions and the strong odor of burnt marijuana detected by the officer constituted probable cause to search defendant's truck for marijuana. The search was not based upon the traffic violation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had denied defendant's motion for new trial and for extraordinary new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was weaving into other lanes while he was driving on a highway, and he hit a car coming in the other direction head-on, resulting in the death of that car's driver and serious injuries to the passenger. Defendant was drinking at the time of the accident, and his blood-alcohol level indicated that he had committed a DUI. Defendant was convicted of various offenses arising from the accident, and his post-trial motions were denied. On appeal, the court found that blood test results were properly admitted, as a proper foundation was laid under O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6-392(a)(1)(A) by testimony from the supervisor of the lab technician who performed the blood testing. An issue regarding the constitutionality of O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-5-55(a) was not preserved for review where it was first raised in the new trial motion. Other objections to admission of the blood test results lacked merit where there was no transcript to support defendant's claims. Any Brady violation in failing to apprise defendant that the technician had previously switched other blood samples was harmless, as the results of the blood tests run by her were cumulative. Accordingly, denial of the new trial motions was proper.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that, so construed, &sect;&nbsp;40-6-390(a) was sufficiently definite to inform a person of common intelligence as to when he was violating the law. Evidence that defendant's use of prescription drugs while driving caused her to be so impaired that she was unable to control a truck supported the vehicular homicide conviction. The requisite criminal negligence was shown to prove reckless driving as the predicate violation for vehicular homicide. Defendant recklessly drove her truck off the road and fatally injured a pedestrian; the acts were precipitated by defendant's use of prescription drugs. Defendant admitted that she had taken numerous prescription drugs and that she knew that she was too sleepy to safely drive. Despite warnings that the drugs could cause drowsiness, defendant continued to drive. Finally, the State could use evidence that defendant's driving was impaired by drug use to prove reckless driving as the reckless driving violation could have been precipitated by the drug usage.</SPAN></P>

Defendant airplane parts supplier joined in the summary judgment motion. The family appealed from an order entered by the Superior Court of Fulton County (Georgia) dismissing the suit, upon the summary judgment motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the suit was properly dismissed under the doctrine of forum non conveniens. The appellate court noted that O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-10-31.1 was enacted after the dismissal of the suit. The trial court properly considered the motion as a motion to dismiss because forum non conveniens was a matter in abatement. Section 9-10-31.1 governed the appeal under 2005 Ga. Laws 1, &sect;&nbsp;15. The trial court did not orally or in the order show that it considered the O.C.G.A. &sect;&nbsp;9-10-31.1 factors. A trial court had to make specific findings either in writing or on the record showing that it considered all of the &sect; 9-10-31.1(a) factors and the court's citation to a case did not show that it did so. Further, a summary order was not sufficient. Important public policy reasons existed for requiring trial courts to make specific findings on the record. The silence of the Georgia legislature in the statute was not a bar to the imposition of such a requirement. Finally, under &sect;&nbsp;9-10-31.1(b), the filing of a written stipulation was a mandatory condition precedent to a dismissal for forum non conveniens.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal order was vacated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant represented himself at trial and, on appeal, argued that he did not knowingly waive his right to counsel and that the trial court failed to outline the dangers of self-representation. The appellate court found that this claim was belied by the transcript of a hearing where the judge went to extraordinary lengths to ensure that defendant made a knowing and intelligent waiver. The trial court's efforts more than sufficed to adequately inform defendant of the dangers of proceeding pro se. Defendant failed to raise alleged procedural errors in the trial court and thus waived those errors on appeal. Having failed to file either a demurrer or motion to quash, defendant waived any objection to the form of the indictment. Defendant did not move for severance and so waived any right to raise any objection on appeal. Defendant orally challenged the jury array, but since he refused to participate in voir dire or jury selection and failed to set forth any facts showing that his jury was not properly composed, his purported challenge was waived. Since defendant failed to raise any constitutional challenge to O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-5-70 during trial, his claim was waived on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The surety argued that the suit was time-barred. The appellate court held that the suit was time-barred. The surety produced an affidavit stating that the center was completed and was dedicated more than one year before the suit was filed. The subcontractor failed to rebut the affidavit or show that the affiant was not authorized to accept the completed project. The one-year statute of limitations period under O.C.G.A. &sect;&nbsp;36-91-95 also ran on the breach of an implied contract, bad faith breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and unjust enrichment claims as all of the claims arose from work performed while the surety was acting as surety on the payment bond and from its refusal to pay the subcontractor under the payment bond. It was unnecessary to reach the claim that &sect;&nbsp;36-91-95 was unconstitutionally vague. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a continuance of the summary judgment motion hearing as the statute of limitations defense was raised more than three months before the hearing and the subcontractor did not attempt to conduct further discovery after the defense was raised.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Georgia Professional Standards Commission (PSC) found probable cause that appellee school superintendent had violated an ethics rule. The PSC was granted discretionary review of the reversal by the Superior Court of Turner County (Georgia) of the PSC's decision, which had adopted an administrative law judge's (ALJ) findings, but had suspended the superintendent's certificate for one year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The PSC argued that there was evidence that the superintendent violated Interim Ethics Rules 505-2-.03(1)(n) and (o), Ga. Comp. R. &amp; Regs. r. 505-2-.03(1)(n) and (o) (1999). The appellate court held that the superintendent, believing that the Sheriff's Department's response to an elderly friend's report of suspicions of criminal activity was too slow, twice confronted the suspect. Once, the superintendent brandished a firearm. The superintendent instigated the confrontations on a public highway, on a school day, during school hours. The superintendent was a role model to students. Violence and the use of weapons by students was a significant public policy concern in the educational system. Thus, the superintendent's conduct was detrimental to the morals of pupils under Rule 505-2-.03(1)(n). The superintendent's bad conduct and example also served as &quot;good and sufficient cause&quot; for the suspension of his educator certificate under Rule 505-2-.03(1)(o). Finally, the good and sufficient cause standard was not void-for-vagueness. The superintendent had due notice that taking the law into his own hands could constitute good and sufficient cause for the suspension of his certificate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Georgia trial court convicted defendant, a juvenile tried as an adult, of voluntary manslaughter, and sentenced him to 15 years in prison, but requiring that he serve only 12. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction and sentence, contending that the trial court erred in: (1) instructing the jury on voluntary manslaughter and justification, (2) using a confusing verdict form that caused the jury to return an inconsistent verdict, (3) giving an unduly suggestive Allen charge, (4) admitting his videotaped statement into evidence, and (5) increasing his sentence when it ruled on his motion to modify the sentence. Defendant also argued that O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-11-28(b)(2) was unconstitutional because it required that he be tried as an adult. The appeals court only agreed with the contention that the trial court erred only when it increased defendant's sentence once he began to serve it. The voluntary manslaughter statute at issue did not specifically authorize the manner of resentencing imposed by the trial court. Moreover, defendant already begun serving his sentence at the time that the trial court increased his punishment from 15 years to 20 years. The original sentence was final at the time it was imposed, and the trial court had no reason to believe that it was otherwise. Thus, the trial court's increased sentence constituted double jeopardy and could not stand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was affirmed. But, the sentence was vacated, and a resentencing was ordered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges arose from the sexual assault of defendant's four-year-old daughter and six-year-old son. Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions. The appellate court found that the evidence was sufficient to establish that the rape of the daughter was accomplished by acts of physical force. The evidence showed that defendant carried the child from her bed to the bed defendant shared with her husband, watched her husband lay on top of the child squeezing her stomach and rendering her unable to cry out even when the husband hurt her by placing his penis in her vagina. Any rational trier of fact could have found that defendant was a party to the husband's forcible rape of her daughter. Defendant failed to preserve her argument that the trial court's admission of child hearsay was error. The issue of ineffective assistance was not properly before the trial court as the defense counsel who argued the new trial motion was the same attorney who represented defendant at trial. Defendant's plain error assertion was not within the scope of the enumerated errors, and case did not present the exceptional circumstances required for plain error review.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the employees' claims were contract claims, for which sovereign immunity had been waived. The Board of Trustees of the ERS had the general authority to effectuate the provisions of the ERS Act, O.C.G.A. &sect; 47-2-1 et seq. The employees had a right to retire on a service retirement allowance based on tables adopted by the Board, which were based on the employee's earnings. In 1998, the Act was amended to allow members with 25 years of creditable service to retire before age 60, but the Board was required to reduce the amount of their retirement allowances based on age.

Defendant's second first-degree homicide by vehicle and lesser-included offense convictions merged into the count one conviction. Defendant was sentenced to serve 15 years in confinement. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the test results obtained under the implied consent statute were improperly admitted. The appellate court noted that defendant was not arrested after the fatal crash for any offense in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6-391 nor was there probable cause to arrest him for any such violation. The Georgia Supreme Court had held that the implied consent provisions of O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-5-55(a) were unconstitutional to the extent they required a defendant to submit to a search of his bodily substances without probable cause. Thus, the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to suppress the test results. Without the test results, there was no evidence to support defendant's conviction on count one. The new rule regarding implied consent testing applied retroactively to defendant's case as the conviction was not final when the new rule was announced. The case was remanded to the trial court with instructions that a judgment of conviction and sentence be entered on the guilty verdicts on alternative count two and on the lesser-included offense. After entry of the judgment of conviction and sentence on those verdicts, defendant would have the right to appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When a police officer arrived at the scene of a reported auto accident, he saw defendant's overturned truck. The officer noticed a strong odor of alcohol and that defendant was pinned inside. The officer thought defendant might be intoxicated or have a head injury. At the hospital, the officer noticed an odor of alcohol on defendant's breath. The officer then read defendant the implied consent notice. When defendant refused to cooperate in having his blood drawn, the officer found that to be a refusal to submit to a blood test. However, defendant was not arrested until six days later. At trial, the trial court denied his motion to suppress evidence of his refusal to submit to a blood test. He was convicted of DUI and of failure to maintain a lane. The Georgia Supreme Court then found unconstitutional in a different case that part of the statute that the trial court relied on to admit evidence of the refusal to take the blood test. On appeal, the appellate court found that the motion to suppress should have been granted because the implied consent warnings were not to be given in the absence of an arrest, as was done in defendant's case, even if probable cause to arrest existed.</SPAN></P>

The officer noticed that defendant had bloodshot, watery eyes, and smelled of alcohol. The officer administered field sobriety requests, all of which indicated defendant was under the influence of alcohol. Defendant was arrested and charged with multiple offenses. Certified Georgia Department of Public Safety records were admitted at his trial to show he received a habitual violator notice. The officer testified that he deviated from the standardized field sobriety tests, but added the tests he used were the same. After defendant was convicted on all charges, the appellate court found he waived his objection to the records being admitted by not challenging whether they met the statutory requirements. It also found the results of the field sobriety tests were admissible, the jury was properly sworn and instructed, and defendant did not show that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence a radar speed detection device.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a bench trial, defendant appealed the judgment of the Traffic Violations Bureau of the State Court of Coweta County (Georgia), which convicted defendant upon one count of following too close, in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6-49; one count of failure to maintain lane, in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6-48; and, one count of driving too fast for conditions, in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6-180.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed on appeal that he did not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waive his right to a jury trial. The court found that because defendant raised his claim for the first time on appeal through appellate counsel, the record was insufficient to determine whether he knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to a jury trial. Further, the court noted that the rights advisement provided for on the written notice form used in the case was tailored not to a plea of not guilty, but rather to a guilty plea, and, as a result, was not tailored to the plea entered in fact. Inasmuch as defendant failed to raise the question of his waiver of the right to a misdemeanor jury trial in the trial court, the State was entitled to an opportunity to meet its burden of showing that the entry of a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of the right to a jury trial was made in the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that a defendant under arrest for DUI, as defendant was in the case, was permitted to withdraw his or her consent to a State-administered blood test at any time before the blood sample had been analyzed.

The court noted that the question presented by the case was one of first impression and held that the trial court erred in concluding that a defendant was permitted to withdraw his or her consent to State-administered chemical testing after having been arrested for DUI. The court acknowledged that a defendant was permitted to rescind a refusal to submit to State testing but held that no fair analogy was permitted between rescinding refusal of State testing and withdrawing consent to State testing once consent had been given. The court stated to permit withdrawal of one's consent was contrary to public safety policy mandating that drivers arrested for DUI submit to State-administered chemical testing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer challenged the judgment entered, asserting that his request for a waiver pursuant to Ga. Comp.

However, the officer failed to provide a transcript of either the executive committee meeting or the full council meeting, even though such oral proceedings or any part thereof could have been transcribed or otherwise recorded at his request. Second, the officer's constitutionality argument lacked merit, as he failed to preserve the issue for review. Further, because he acknowledged receiving letters sent via certified mail from the Council regarding revocation of his certification, and a hearing thereon, he was afforded due process.  Third, the Council properly determined that his failure or refusal to claim the letter did not establish good cause for granting a waiver. Finally, a claim that the Council failed to comply with O.C.G.A. &sect; 50-13-9.1(e) was not preserved for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant yelled racial insults at his cousin and her daughter, who was part Hispanic.

The State also gave notice of its intent to introduce evidence of prior convictions pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-7. Defendant entered a plea of guilty to one charge and he was sentenced as a recidivist. On appeal, the court held that defendant's sentence was proper, as the State provided sufficient notice of its intentions during sentencing. The court held that O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-7 was applicable for sentence enhancement even if defendant pleaded guilty, and as such, a holding to the contrary was overruled. Application of O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-2(a) was not precluded by such a plea, as long as defendant was afforded &quot;clear notice&quot; of evidence that the State intended to rely on for enhancement.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the statute prohibiting rape, O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-1, said it was a capital offense, the Unites States Supreme Court held the death penalty could not be imposed if no death resulted. The appellate court held, for purposes of the speedy trial statutes,&nbsp;O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 17-7-170, 17-7-171, it was still a capital offense, lengthening the time the State had to prepare, under O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-7-171(b), to the third term of court following the term in which speedy trial was demanded. The focus of the speedy trial statutes was not on enhancing defendant's punishment but on the time the legislature found appropriate to allow the State to prepare its case, and the legislature's decision that rape required more time to prepare was true regardless of the authorized punishment. Defendant's motion for acquittal was filed prior to the end of the term in which the State was required to try him, so the motion was premature. Defendant's speedy trial demand was also insufficient to notify the State that a speedy trial was demanded because it did not refer to trial at the next term or a &quot;speedy trial,&quot; use statutory language from the speedy trial statutes, or refer to the statutes.</SPAN></P>

A magistrate issued a bail order that allowed defendant to be released from custody by posting bond. The bail order contained a condition in which defendant waived his Fourth Amendment rights.

The condition, in accordance with the Eighth Amendment, was a reasonable exercise of the trial court's function of balancing the rights of the accused with public safety interests. The investigator and officers needed a reasonable or good-faith suspicion to search defendant. There was no evidence of bad faith. The officers acted reasonably in investigating information that defendant was still involved in drug activity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sex offender filed a declaratory judgment action against appellee State in Troup County Superior Court (Georgia), arguing that O.C.G.A. &sect; 42-1-13 was an unconstitutional ex-post-facto law as applied to him. The trial court declared that O.C.G.A. &sect; 42-1-13 was not unconstitutional as applied to the sex offender, and it denied a temporary injunction staying enforcement of the statute against him. The sex offender appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sex offender had pled guilty to statutory rape. While on probation, before the enactment of O.C.G.A. &sect; 42-1-13, the sex offender began living within 1,000 feet of a day care facility. The sex offender's probation officer informed the sex offender that he was in violation of &sect; 42-1-13 by living at that house and that he would be arrested if he did not move. The sex offender argued that the statute increased his sentence retroactively because, before the law was passed, he was in compliance with the law when he began living in the house in question. The appellate court ruled that even though &sect; 42-1-13 was passed after the conviction and used the prior conviction as an element of a future offense, this was not an ex post facto law. The statute only punished a future offense, which punishment was enhanced by the prior conviction. The sex offender could only have been punished under &sect; 42-1-13 if he prospectively chose to violate it by continuing to live at his current home. The fact that the prior conviction subjected the sex offender to possible punishment under &sect; 42-1-13 did not make the statute into an unconstitutional ex-post-facto law.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court disagreed. First, members of defendant's family participated in a scheme whereby they obtained credit cards in the names of non-existent businesses and used the cards to buy goods for their own use with no intention of repayment. Even if defendant did not personally sign for these purchases, a jury could conclude that he aided and abetted the use of the business card where he agreed to his stepdaughter's offer to obtain the card for his use, that the business was fictitious, that defendant was aware of the scheme to commit fraud, and that he was seen often in the store where the purchases occurred. Second, because defendant pled guilty to the charges of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, he waived any suppression issue. Finally, as his sentence was otherwise permitted by statute, imposition of the same was not error.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a speedy trial demand and moved for the charges to be transferred from a probate court to the Butts County Superior Court (Georgia). Defendant appealed, claiming that the State failed to comply with his demand for a speedy trial pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-7-170.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges were filed in probate court. Defendant filed a speedy trial demand in the probate court, but did not file a new demand in superior court. Rather, he claimed that the demand filed in the probate court was properly filed in the superior court when the court clerk stamped the probate court records as filed in the superior court. The appellate court found that the demand filed in the probate court was ineffective since the probate court was not a court which had the authority to impanel juries to try defendant on the charges. Under O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-7-170, a demand was binding only in the court in which it was filed, except where the case was transferred without a request from defendant. Because defendant requested that his case be transferred to the superior court, the transferred demand was not binding in the superior court, nor was it filed in the superior court within the meaning of O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-7-170. Defendant thus failed to file a demand for a speedy trial in the superior court pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-7-170. Defendant's claim that O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-7-170 was unconstitutionally vague was not ruled on by the trial court, so it presented nothing for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

The Georgia Alcoholic Beverage Code, specifically O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 3-3-9 and 3-3-27(c)(2), did not make it a criminal act to violate Department regulations, and there was no prohibition against indirect ownership of a wholesaler by a retail employee. Further, the first shareholder's husband's indirect interest was not created through the issuance of the shares to his wife. The Department had its own means of enforcing violations of its regulations, which did not include depriving the first shareholder of her stock. Finally, the first shareholder's claim did not relate to the alleged regulatory violations. The denial of summary judgment was proper as to the second shareholder.

The appellate court concluded that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion as there was no evidence that defendant was asked a second time whether he would consent to a state-administered test or that he rescinded his refusal and thereafter consented. He was thus administered a breath test simply because he did not refuse to cooperate when told to blow into the breathing test device. Defendant also contended that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that he had the burden of showing any human errors in the administration or interpretation of field sobriety evaluations. The appellate court held that, as the instruction did not relate to any element of the crime but was merely an application of the principle that the burden of proving a fact lied upon the party asserting it, the charge was not burden shifting. Finally, the appellate court found no error in the denial of defendant's double jeopardy plea, as defense counsel impliedly consented to the mistrial by failing to object.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the CEO failed to preserve his constitutional challenge by seeking a ruling from the trial court. The trial court properly expunged only the ultra vires portions of the presentment. The remainder of the presentment was not ultra vires and could be filed and published. Nothing mandated the expungement of an entire presentment after the trial judge redacted all ultra vires criticism. Statements unnecessary to the purpose sought to be accomplished by the report that cast reflections of misconduct in office upon a public officer and impugned his character had been expunged. The grand jury report was in the nature of a general presentment in which the grand jury took note of alleged excessive overtime for county employees. It was within the province of the grand jury to focus attention upon the matter and make appropriate recommendations. The remaining limited criticisms made by the grand jury came within the ambit of O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 15-12-71(b), (c), and 15-12-80, and did not appear to be criticisms of misconduct in office or impugned character.</SPAN></P>

The victim also appealed from an order in another case, wherein the trial court dismissed her second renewed complaint, based on the same facts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim sued defendant in a county superior court for injuries arising from the car accident. She voluntarily dismissed the action and then re-filed in a county state court. That action was dismissed due to the statute of limitations bar, as there was no showing that the limitations period had been tolled. In a motion for reconsideration of the first dismissal, the victim raised the challenged constitutionality of O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-2-61 for the first time. She also appealed from that dismissal on that same day. The trial court indicated that it could not rule on the motion for reconsideration because it had been divested of jurisdiction due to the appeal. During the pendency of the appeal, the victim attempted to renew her complaint for a second time, which resulted in a dismissal by the trial court because it was based on the same facts as the case that was appealed. The victim appealed from the second dismissal. The court found that the constitutional issue was not timely raised in the trial court, and accordingly, was not reviewable on appeal. The court held that the appeal from the second dismissal was rendered moot by the finding that the first dismissal was not erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court dismissing the first renewed complaint, and dismissed the appeal from the order dismissing the second renewed complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of several offenses after his motion to suppress drug evidence was denied by the trial court. On appeal, defendant argued that the drugs at issue were found pursuant to a stop of his vehicle at an illegal roadblock. The appellate court found that the roadblock was unconstitutional and any possible Terry stop of defendant was also illegal, but the discovery of the drugs was sufficiently attenuated from any illegal stop so as to render the drugs admissible. The facts showed that while the stop was illegal, defendant immediately shoved the officers, fled from them, and discarded the drugs in a culvert during his subsequent apprehension. That act constituted a battery, which was an independent basis for defendant's further detention, and which rendered his apprehension lawful. Thus, the drugs defendant threw down were admissible since the battery and subsequent flight, even if triggered by an improper stop, provided an independent basis for the admission of evidence uncovered during such lawful apprehension. The drugs were admissible on those grounds, even though they would have been suppressed if uncovered during the unconstitutional stop.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The builder sought arbitration when he could not resolve payment issues with the homeowners. The appellate court held no pre-award interest was improperly included in the arbitrator's award, and the award was supported by the evidence. The arbitrator did not have to state findings or address every issue, and he addressed the homeowners' counterclaim when, by awarding them no money, he found the claim invalid except for a credit against the builder's award. The surety the homeowners obtained to secure release of the builder's lien was a necessary party whose joinder was not error. It was not error to award the builder attorney fees, under O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-15-14(b), as the homeowners' arguments stated no basis for vacating the arbitrator's award. The arbitrator's failure to award attorney fees did not restrict the trial court's ability to do so, and the award was not an abuse of discretion. As no basis for vacating the arbitrator's award and no reason to anticipate reversal of the trial court's confirmation of that award was shown, the appeal was brought for purposes of delay, obligating the homeowners to pay a 10 percent penalty, under O.C.G.A. &sect; 5-6-6, for a frivolous appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As defendant made the same double jeopardy arguments rejected in his second appeal, the appellate court was bound by its previous ruling and could not consider this argument. His daughter's testimony on retrial was sufficient evidence to support his convictions. A letter defendant wrote to a family services agency investigator was not improperly admitted, as there was no evidence that the investigator or anyone else at the agency required or encouraged him to submit the letter. Thus, the letter was unrelated to constitutionally deficient protocol for classifying child abuse reports in a central registry, and there was no reason to exclude it. Under the totality of the circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting his daughter's out-of-court statements concerning the acts of molestation. Because defense counsel expressly agreed with the court's proposed jury charge and did not object after it was given, the court would not review defendant's objection to it. Finally, there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court's decision to give curative instructions rather than declare a mistrial after his ex-wife injected evidence of his bad character.</SPAN></P>

Defendant refused a request for consent to search the residence, but the wife granted this request, and incriminating evidence was seized. The appellate court held defendant could reasonably believe his wishes would be honored, as, ordinarily, persons with equal rights in a place would accommodate each other by not admitting persons over the other's objection while the other was present. Defendant could withdraw his wife's consent to the search. The &quot;common authority&quot; on which the wife's consent to a search was based also allowed the husband to exercise privacy rights on behalf of all occupants, particularly as Georgia courts were to avoid circumstances creating adversity between spouses. Given competing responses to requests for consent, the police had to get a warrant. Defendant's unequivocal assertion of his Fourth Amendment rights vitiated a presumption that his wife waived those rights. Evidence obtained from the warrantless search was not admissible under the good faith, independent source, or inevitable discovery doctrines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the police officer improperly told him that the implied consent statute was invoked due to the seriousness of the injuries resulting from the accident. The appellate court held that the Georgia Supreme Court had ruled that O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-5-55(a) was unconstitutional to the extent that it was invoked by the existence of serious injuries. Because the officer misled defendant about his implied consent rights, the results of the blood test had to be excluded. While the implied consent statute still provided that consent was implied if a person was arrested for a violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6-391, defendant was not arrested before the testing was conducted. Although count one of the accusation did not specify a particular drug that defendant was under the influence of, the accusation was not impermissibly vague. O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6-391(a)(2) prohibited driving under the influence of any drug, and defendant was informed of the charged offense and that he would need to meet charges that he drove while under the influence of amphetamines and cannabinoids. Defendant was not misled to his prejudice by any imperfection in the accusation, and any error was harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driving under the influence convictions were reversed, and the case was remanded for a new trial on those charges. The denial of the motion to quash count one of the accusation was affirmed, as well as the conviction for failure to maintain a lane.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant raped the 12-year-old victim, the victim told her mother, who told the police. A detective found defendant's checkbook in the abandoned house where the victim said the rape occurred; a check had been written from it earlier that day. The doctor who examined the victim within hours of the incident found abrasions and tenderness consistent with her description of what had occurred. The appellate court found this evidence sufficient to support defendant's convictions. The trial court properly removed a juror for cause under O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-12-172, as her husband had been arrested for sexual molestation in the same county, and she worried about the impact her vote in the case might have on her husband's case. As to the Child Hearsay Statute,&nbsp;O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-3-16a, the Georgia Supreme Court had already considered and rejected the argument that it was unconstitutional. Defense counsel was not ineffective for not objecting or moving for a mistrial after an officer testified that he read defendant his rights, but did not interview him, since it was not clear that this was an improper comment on defendant's right to remain silent, and defendant could not show prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughter challenged the judgment entered, claiming error. The appeals court agreed. According to friends and family members, the decedent intended the money given to his son to be an advance against his inheritance. At the time the money was transferred, no writing was required to document an advance against an inheritance. Rather, the intention of the testator governed, and such intent could be proved with parol evidence. The trial court held that because the daughter's rights did not vest until after the probate revision, the revised code applied. However, the daughter also alleged that the son breached his fiduciary duty in failing to acknowledge that the monetary transfer was an advance. Although he denied it, the record was replete with evidence to the contrary. Thus, a genuine issue of material fact existed as to this claim, making summary judgment inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted after a jury trial in the Georgia trial court of violating various county ordinances, including failing to restrain her dogs, creating a public nuisance, keeping a vicious animal, and failing to display a vaccination tag on one dog's collar. She appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed (1) the accusation gave her insufficient notice, (2) the &quot;public nuisance&quot; ordinance was unconstitutionally vague, and (3) the court erred in commenting on the evidence, in not requiring a showing of intent, in not recusing itself, and in denying her motion for a directed verdict. The appellate court found the court did not err in denying the demurrer to the indictment, as the accusation sufficiently set out the crime charged. Dogs that went onto neighboring properties and viciously attacked another's animals clearly were &quot;public nuisances&quot; under the challenged ordinance, which as worded gave sufficient notice of the forbidden conduct. Similar to the state cruelty-to-animal statute, the county ordinances were primarily safety in nature and did not require a showing of malice or intent. The evidence sufficed to sustain the convictions and therefore, the court did not err in denying the motion for a directed verdict. There was nothing inappropriate about the court's statement to the jury, as it was not a comment on the evidence, and contrary to the requirements of Ga. Unif. St. Ct. R. 25.1, no affidavit accompanied the unsworn, one-paragraph motion to recuse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial courts found that the Division's decision granting the CON to the hospital was arbitrary, capricious, exceeded the Division's statutory authority, and was not supported by substantial evidence. Both courts held that the Division should not have included a hospital's hospital beds in its calculations because it had been closed for more than 12 months by the time the CON was issued. The appeals court held that the trial courts erred in finding that the Division's interpretation of the 12-month rule in this context was arbitrary, capricious, and not supported by substantial evidence, and that the Division should have considered this application as for a new facility, not a replacement facility. A CON application for a replacement hospital did not have to always be considered as one for a new hospital. The superior courts erred in reevaluating the service area issue. The proposed new institutional health service was reasonably consistent with the relevant goals and objectives of the State Health Plan. The Division's decision was not contrary to the general considerations. Finally, the Perinatal Rule did not apply.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the substitution of the nonresident executors was, for purposes of venue, qualitatively the same as when a resident defendant moved out of the county; thus, the substitution did not divest the court of venue. The executors also argued that the contract was unenforceable because it lacked mutuality of obligations. The appellate court concluded that the contract recited adequate consideration; therefore, the agreement was not illusory but was binding. Finally, as for the executors' argument that a jury issue remained as to whether the contract was in furtherance of an immoral relationship and thus unenforceable, the appellate court found that the contract did not require the performance of an illegal or immoral act and thus, was not void.</SPAN></P>

On appeal from the grant of summary judgment for the police defendants, the court held that it would not address the owner's state law claims because his brief did not address them. The facts known to the detective at the time that she issued the citation were sufficient to warrant the belief that the owner had committed the theft. The detective was experienced and relied on a trustworthy source to establish probable cause. The owner made no argument and offered no proof that the city had a policy or custom of arresting individuals without probable cause. Accordingly, he could not pursue a claim against the city pursuant to &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

The board of assessors argued on appeal that the owners' complaint should have been dismissed because they failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, and that the trial court erred in finding that the board of assessors did not provide a simple, nontechnical description of the basis for the new assessment. On appeal, the court found that the owners were required to raise their tax issues, including the issue of whether they received valid notice, before the county board of equalization and exhaust their administrative remedies by the statutorily provided appeal under O.C.G.A. &sect; 48-5-311.

The appellate court held that the golf cart was a &quot;vehicle&quot; under O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-1-1(75). Since it was self-propelled, it was a &quot;motor vehicle&quot; under O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-1-1(33). Therefore, since defendant drove it on the highway, he had to have a driver's license. The motorized cart statutes,&nbsp;O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 40-6-330, 40-6-331(b), (c) authorized licensing of the vehicle, not the driver.

He lost control of the vehicle he was driving. His passenger died. Defendant was charged with homicide by vehicle in the first-degree under O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6-393(a), based on an allegation that he drove a vehicle under the influence of alcohol in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6-391. Defense counsel explained the sentence he could receive. He decided to plead guilty. The trial court imposed a longer sentence than he expected. He filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea and motion in arrest of judgment, which were denied. After defendant appealed, the appellate court found he did not show his counsel's ineffectiveness caused defendant's guilty plea not to be knowingly and voluntarily entered, O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6-391(k)(1) was a proper predicate offense, and no error occurred in denying the motion in arrest of judgment since his equal protection rights were not violated. Despite the predicate offense making it easier to convict him because he was under 21-years-old, the predicate offense bore a rational relationship to the State's interest in deterring younger, more inexperienced drivers from drinking and driving.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer then sued the commissioner for damages, alleging that the executions and levy were wrongful for failure to give notice beforehand. On appeal from a judgment for the commissioner, the taxpayer argued that the statutes allowing the levy, specifically, O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 48-2-51; 48-2-55; 48-3-3; 48-3-3.1, were unconstitutional and that issues of material fact precluded summary judgment.

Further, the material facts were undisputed, thereby warranting summary judgment. O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 48-3-3, 48-2-55, 48-3-9 did not require that the commissioner give the taxpayer notice of the levy prior to levying upon the personal property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, plaintiff telephone customers sued defendant radio station, claiming that the radio station violated the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 227. The State Court of Fulton County (Georgia) entered summary judgment for the radio station as to one telephone customer, and denied summary judgment as to the other. The telephone customer and the radio station appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the radio station's motion with respect to one of the telephone customers pursuant to the &quot;established business relationship&quot; exemption of the TCPA because he had participated in a free discount program run by the radio station. The appellate court found that since the telephone customer was enrolled in the discount program, calls containing an unsolicited advertisement were not automatically prohibited by the TCPA. Congress did not intend the TCPA to impose liability upon a telemarketer for calling an established customer at a number other than the one furnished by the customer, so the fact that the telephone customer was called at home, when he had given the radio station only his work number, was irrelevant. The radio station properly raised an &quot;as applied&quot; attack upon the constitutionality of the TCPA as a defense to the civil action, and the trial court erred in ruling that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the issue. Judicial review of federal statutes by state courts was especially appropriate when Congress granted to state courts exclusive jurisdiction over private actions brought to enforce the challenged federal statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed in the appeal brought by the telephone customer. The judgment was reversed in the appeal brought by the radio station.</SPAN></P>

A bench trial was held and he was convicted on that charge.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Georgia trial court granted class certification to appellee faculty members who filed suit against appellant, the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia, granted the faculty members' motion for summary judgment as to their claim that the Board breached their employment contracts, and denied the Board's motion for summary judgment on the same issue. The Board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board challenged the judgments entered, arguing that there was a rational basis for permitting each university to decide which calculation of statutorily-mandated pay raises to use. At issue was whether the Board's classification of similarly situated 10-month faculty members was a classification that was reasonable and not arbitrary. The instant court held that there was no rational basis for authorizing the difference in treatment of the faculty members. There was no standard delineating what sets of circumstances would authorize the use of each method, and instead conferred upon the institutions uncontrolled discretion in deciding which of the two methods to use in calculating pay. All faculty members, regardless of the work they did, were entitled to the same six percent pay raise. The classification was defective in that it drew a line between otherwise identical groups without an objective basis for doing so. There was no error in granting class certification because both the 1983 Georgia Constitution and its 1990 amendment provided for the waiver of sovereign immunity as to claims based upon theories of contract liability, the issue herein.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a general and special demurrer contending that he could admit to the allegations against him and not be guilty of a crime, and that O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-11-126(d) was unconstitutional because the term &quot;similar compartment of the vehicle&quot; was vague. The appellate court held that (1) defendant's failure to point to a specific provision of the constitution that the statute violated was not fatal to his constitutional challenge; (2) the trial court erred by finding that defendant had not properly raised the issue of whether &sect; 16-11-126(d) was constitutional; and (3) remand was required so the trial court could rule on defendant's challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Cobb County Probate Court, Georgia, ordered appellant executor to reimburse the estate for commissions and expenses erroneously paid to him as executor, for interest that should have been generated by the estate account, and for items missing from the estate. The executor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The executor challenged the judgments, contending that he was entitled to commissions earned under O.C.G.A. &sect; 53-6-140, interest was improperly awarded because he failed to invest in interest bearing accounts, and damages were improperly awarded for lost estate property. He also alleged that O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-9-120 was unconstitutional because it violated Ga. Const. art. 3, &sect; 6, para. 4(b) (1983). The appeals court did not address these issues, but instead found it lacked jurisdiction to consider the appeal. Because the plain language of O.C.G.A. &sect; 5-6-38(a) and O.C.G.A. &sect; 1-3-1(a) made no provisions for extending the filing time for notices of appeal to compensate for county declared holidays, and O.C.G.A. &sect; 1-4-2 limited religious holidays to Sundays, the court found that Good Friday was not a holiday for purposes of extending the filing date. Further, nothing indicated that the executor attempted to file his notice of appeal on Good Friday. Thus, the appeals court could not determine whether he merely assumed that he would be unable to file his pleading on that day, or whether the clerk's office had made provisions for filing pleadings despite being closed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor and clinic challenged the judgment entered. In denying partial summary judgment, the trial court ruled that under the discovery rule, the patient's claims relating to the doctor's negligence in diagnosing her condition and performing the total hysterectomy were not time-barred. The patient did not know the causal relationship between her injury, her infertility, and the doctor's breach of duty, the misdiagnosis of the patient's condition as endometriosis, until after a September 1998 surgery. The discovery rule could not be applied to the current medical malpractice statute of limitation, even in a case in which a plaintiff could not reasonably be expected to have known that her legal rights had been invaded until she discovered the causal relationship between the doctor's negligence and her injury. The rule that the injury occurred when its symptoms manifested themselves to the patient applied even if the patient was not aware of either the cause of the pain or of the connection between the symptoms and the negligent act or omission.</SPAN></P>

Second, defendant alleged that officers lacked probable cause to search, specifically arguing that the totality of circumstances, including the informant's veracity and reliability, was insufficient to establish probable cause. But the informant's tip was corroborated by a detective. Further, if reliability was an issue, the informant demonstrated his reliability by meeting with the investigator and putting himself on the line by participating in the controlled purchase. Third, private papers seized from defendant's truck were admissible, as the evidence complained of was not part of the State's evidence against defendant, and as such, did not contribute to his guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in Georgia trial court found defendant guilty of 20 felony counts: 1 count of kidnapping with bodily injury; 2 counts of kidnapping; 1 count of burglary; 1 count of armed robbery; 1 count of aggravated battery; 3 counts of aggravated assault; 1 count of hijacking a motor vehicle; and 10 counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was sufficient evidence to convict for hijacking a motor vehicle where defendant had a weapon, took a vehicle from the person or presence of another while in possession of the weapon, and used force, violence, or intimidation to accomplish the taking. Error was waived as to the form of the indictment. As no demurrers or timely motions in arrest of judgment were filed, a motion for new trial could not be considered to be a viable procedural substitute for a motion in arrest of judgment. An ineffectiveness claim had to be raised at the earliest practicable moment. That was not done. The jury instructions, when viewed as a whole, fairly and accurately presented the relevant considerations and did not shift the burden of proof to defendant. Defendant's possession of a firearm during the commission of each of the 10 different felonies charged authorized an additional indictment on the &quot;separate offense&quot; of possession of a firearm during the commission of each felony under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-11-106.

The owners claimed that the covenant was automatically renewed in 1993 by the enactment of O.C.G.A. &sect; 44-5-60(d)(1). The appellate court found that &sect; 44-5-60(d)(1) did not apply retroactively to the 1977 deed; it only applied prospectively.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother appealed from an order by the trial court (Georgia) granting the State's request for forfeiture of her automobile under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-391.2(c), after her son, a habitual offender, was arrested for driving without a license, driving under the influence of alcohol, and leaving the scene of an accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As there was no transcript provided to the appellate court, it could not consider the mother's argument as to the sufficiency of the evidence. The appellate court held that the trial court considered whether the mother was an innocent owner, but concluded that the mother knew or reasonably should have known that her son would operate the vehicle without her permission. The harshness of the forfeiture was proportionate to the gravity of the offense with which the son was charged. The appellate court could not conclude that the trial court was clearly erroneous in its decision to order the vehicle forfeited. The harshness of the penalty was considered, but forfeiture was expressly provided by Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-391.2. The vehicle was the instrumentality used by the son to commit the offense that led to the forfeiture and, therefore, was close enough to the offense to render it &quot;guilty.&quot; While it was not apparent how frequently the son drove his mother's car, it was clear that he was driving it at the time of his arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate cases, a Georgia trial court entered judgment on jury verdicts for plaintiff property owners and for plaintiff neighbors, in their trespass and nuisance surface water invasion cases against defendants, a developer, corporation, and others. Defendants appealed both cases, and the owners appealed from the trial court's reduction of their $ 275,000 punitive damages award to $ 100,000. The cases were consolidated for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners and neighbors alleged damage to their property caused by the increased flow of water and sediment from defendants' detention ponds. Defendants knew of the problem, but refused to remedy it. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err in instructing the jury as to the law governing surface water invasion; and the appellate court had no authority to overturn state supreme court precedent in this area. Evidence showed that the corporation owned 80 percent of one of the developer's partners, from which the jury could have found it exercised enough control over the detention pond so as to enter judgment against it. The owner's proof of the cost of repair was sufficient proof of their damages. The judgments entered for the owners and for the neighbors were thus proper. But the trial court erred in reducing the owners' punitive damages under the BMW of North America test: (1) the ratio of compensatory to punitive damages was 1 to 1.42, which was within acceptable limits; (2) the developer's conduct was reprehensible; and (3) the size of the award was consistent with civil penalties for violating state erosion control regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments entered in both cases in favor of the landowners and the neighbors were affirmed. The judgment reducing the punitive damages award was reversed, and the case was remanded for reinstatement of the punitive damages awarded by the jury.</SPAN></P>

The paternal grandmother petitioned for visitation rights pursuant to a particular statute. The trial court granted her certain visitation rights. The mother did not appeal. The mother learned the paternal grandmother was allowing the child to see the recently-released father. The mother refused to comply with the visitation order, was found in willful contempt of the visitation order, and was ordered to remain in jail until she complied with it. After judgment was entered, the appellate court found the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding the mother in contempt even though the relevant statute was later found unconstitutional, as she did not appeal the order. However, it also found it should have conditioned the jail time on her compliance with the order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This appeal originated from a divorce action between appellee husband and appellant wife filed in the Superior Court of Cherokee County, (Georgia). Before the final divorce hearing, the parties moved to recuse the trial judge on the basis that the wife's attorney had a lawsuit pending against the judge. The judge denied the motion, ruling that it was untimely and that the affidavit was insufficient. The wife appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that the disqualification motion, filed July 11th, was untimely because it was not filed within five days after the wife learned of grounds for recusal, and it was filed later than ten days before a July 16th final hearing. The untimeliness of the motion would have justified the court's denial of the wife's motion alone; however, the submitted affidavit was not notarized. The lack of an attestation rendered the affidavit legally insufficient and served as grounds to deny the motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cherokee County (Georgia) enacted an ordinance which required parties who applied for a building permit for new construction in unincorporated areas of Cherokee County to pay an impact fee.

The appellate court noted that, pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 36-13-1, the county had authority to regulate development only in unincorporated areas of the county and held that: (1) because the county lacked the power to impose impact fees on new development in incorporated areas of the county, the county acted rationally and reasonably by imposing impact fees only on new development in unincorporated areas; and (2) the county's ordinance was constitutional in all respects and the trial court erred by finding that it was unconstitutional to the extent fees were collected to fund libraries, roads, and parks.</SPAN></P>

Thus, armed robbery was not considered a capital felony for the purpose of recidivist sentencing, and defendant's sentence was governed by Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-10-7(b). As his armed robbery conviction was his fifth felony conviction, the trial court was authorized to sentence him to the maximum sentence of life imprisonment, with no eligibility for parole.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court concluded that the church government was congregational in form and that all disputes between the parties arose from a question of church discipline and government of ecclesiastical affairs. It further concluded that the complainants had no standing to bring their claim because they had been excommunicated. The appellate court held that the trial court was not forbidden to consider the composition of the church membership for the limited purpose of determining standing to bring a claim on behalf of the church membership. But while the record reflected that two of the complainant faction leaders were excommunicated by resolution of the church session and acknowledged receiving the notice of excommunication, nothing showed that the third leader was excommunicated or otherwise removed from membership in the church. She therefore was qualified to bring an action in which she claimed to represent a majority of the membership of the church. Since the question of majority membership was a question hotly disputed by both factions and therefore was be decided by the trier of fact, the grant of summary judgment by the trial court was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several plaintiff landowners sought judicial guidance concerning the effect of a vote by the DeKalb County Board of Commissioners (Georgia) with respect to defendant applicant's application to change the zoning designation of his property from residential to office use.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that landowners possessed standing to seek a declaratory judgment as to the zoning status of property. They were neighboring property owners, entitled to seek injunctive relief to prevent use of the property in violation of the zoning restrictions. No zoning changes could be approved without the vote of a commissioner in whose district the property is located. Neither the district commissioner nor the superdistrict commissioner from the district in which the disputed property was located voted in favor of the rezoning, and the application therefore was not approved. The trial court's orders in the case were inconsistent with and an earlier order, entered in a different lawsuit. To a great extent, the applicant's own actions precipitated issuance of the two orders that he, without merit, contended were inconsistent.</SPAN></P>

The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation argued that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because it asserted that its constitutional taking claims had never properly been considered by any court. The corporation argued that Fulton Superior Court could not properly rule upon its taking claim because the administrative decision was not final when that court reviewed it. The appellate court found that under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 50-13-19(h)(1), the Fulton Superior Court could consider the claim provided that it was preserved in the administrative proceedings below. The claim for taking was ripe for judicial review at the time the administrative decision was appealed to the superior court. The corporation preserved its constitutional taking claim in the administrative proceeding. The judge in the Fulton Superior Court action considered and rejected the corporation's taking claim. That ruling became final when the appellate court denied the corporation's application for discretionary appeal and the corporation did not appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's inquiry into the victim's family and sexual history was properly precluded. Defendant waived a juror's knowledge of a State's witness. The trial court's initial allowance of defendant's hybrid representation and its subsequent disallowance did not abuse discretion, and counsel's assistance was not ineffective.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturers moved to dismiss, claiming the suit was barred under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-11-184. The trial court granted their motion to dismiss the strict liability claims, but refused to dismiss the negligence claims. The gun manufacturers argued below and on appeal that Georgia law statutorily did not permit the suit. The state contended state law preempted it. The city's response on appeal was that the statute, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-11-184, as amended, could not be applied retroactively to bar it. The state contended that under Georgia's Constitution and laws, it alone had the power to regulate the manufacture, sale, distribution, and promotion of firearms and the lawsuit was an attempt by the city to usurp the governmental power and authority of the Georgia General Assembly. The instant court agreed. Because the state reserved to itself the right to prescribe the manner in which firearms were regulated, the city could not attempt to usurp that power, whether by litigation or regulation, and the trial court erred in not granting the manufacturers' motion to dismiss all claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued the trial court erred by not excluding the victim's testimony regarding the offenses because her testimony was often contradictory.

Lastly, defendant argued the trial court erred by allowing testimony regarding an alleged earlier molestation of the victim. The appellate court admonished a victim's testimony alone was sufficient to support a conviction and inconsistencies therein did not warrant exclusion of the testimony; rather they affected the weight of the evidence. The appellate court held although Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-8-25 provided for a continuance on account of an absent witness, defendant failed to meet his burden of showing a reasonable probability of falsity or how the proffered testimony was material. The appellate court concluded defendant's remaining argument lacked merit because the earlier molestation was not a similar transaction but a prior difficulty between the victim and defendant, and was properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The movie store argued the trial court erred in converting a temporary restraining order into an interlocutory injunction hearing, by not holding a hearing to first determine obscenity without reviewing all the material prior to issuing the injunction, and in issuing the injunction to enforce the vague restrictive term, thereby prohibiting a much greater range of activity than was encompassed by the term pornographic. The appellate court initially noted the movie store had actual notice of the hearing, the complaint, and the issues and the matter was not a consolidated hearing on the merits, but was an interlocutory injunction hearing pursuant to a rule nisi, thus the trial court properly entered the injunction. The appellate court held the trial court was not required to review the material prior to ordering the injunction because the matter involved private contract rights enforcement and did not impact state or federal rights of speech. The appellate court concluded the term pornographic, as used in the restrictive covenant, was plain, clear, and certain; namely, any depiction that was intended or designed to arouse sexual desire.</SPAN></P>

The company had never operated or erected a billboard. As a result, under state law, its damages claim based on lost profits was too speculative for recovery, given its lack of a proven track record of profitability. The jury was not allowed to speculate as to what the company's allegedly lost profits might have amounted to. The company alleged other theories for recovery of damages, but the pre-trial order specifically limited it to the theory of lost profits; thus, under Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion was the fourth time his case had been presented for appellate review. His current motion alleged his sentence was illegal and void because he failed to prove venue at his trial, that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-5-40(b) was unconstitutional, his sentence violated the equal protection clause, and that his sentence was void because Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-5-40(b) was duplicitous. The appellate court initially noted defendant's first two points of error had already been decided adversely to him in his prior appeals, the appellate court was bound by those rulings, and could not consider the issues again. The appellate court held defendant failed to show any discriminatory purpose in the trial court's issuing a sentence that was authorized by law for the crime of kidnapping with bodily injury, thus there was no equal protection violation. The appellate court concluded defendant's argument of duplicity was misguided because kidnapping with bodily injury was a single crime and defendant was properly charged with the crime in his indictment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Georgia trial court convicted defendant of armed robbery and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, and sentenced him to serve ten years for armed robbery. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. Defendant made the same argument in his prior appeal, and the issue was decided adversely to him. Relitigation of the issue was barred by res judicata. The March 1998 amendment to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-10-6.1 did not apply to defendant. Defendant's original sentence was vacated and remanded to afford him the opportunity to be treated as a first offender. Defendant thus lacked standing to pursue a constitutional challenge. Defendant's 10-year sentence fell within the statutory limits for the offense of armed robbery. Since it was within the statutory limits, a presumption arose that the sentence did not violated the Eighth Amendment's guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment. A trial court was not required to treat a defendant as a first offender. To the contrary, trial courts retained discretion in granting first offender treatment. The trial court considered giving defendant first offender status, but concluded it was not appropriate. Thus, the record did not support defendant's contention that the trial court failed to consider first offender treatment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The development authority contracted to purchase land for use as an industrial park. The property was zoned for residential use. After the purchase the development authority applied for a zoning change to permit light industrialization. The county board approved the rezoning application as to part of the property. The residents, who owned nearby property, sought to enjoin the county board from bringing into effect the rezoning by alleging conflicts of interest by county board members. One board member was an office of the bank which financed the transaction. Two board members were on the development authority. On appeal, the court found the discretionary appeal procedure did not apply as the case involved no appeal from a local administrative decision and the residents properly proceeded through direct appeal. Further, the evidence was too speculative and too remote to raise an issue of fact regarding self-interest or conflicted participation by the board members in the rezoning decision.</SPAN></P>

On remand, the citizens sought to enjoin the sale of the bonds. The trial court denied their petition, and they appealed again. Under Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school systems conducted their driver education program through a community school program (CSP). The driver education course was offered to all high school students after regular school hours and on weekends. Because it was not a required subject of the school systems' regular curriculum, enrolled students received no credit for the course. The school systems received no state or federal funding for the course, relying instead on the $ 195 fee charged to each student taking the class. The school systems were able to offer their driver education course to students at a substantially lower price than the driving school because the CSP did not pay any taxes on goods. The appellate court did not see how the school systems were violating any laws or abusing their discretion by offering the driver education course after hours and for a fee. The school systems' operation of the course was not an ultra vires act, and the course did not violate Georgia's Quality Basic Education Act. The trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the school system. Moreover, the driver education course was not unconstitutional because the students paid a fee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sporting club disputed board's assessment of its property, and the tax consulting firm it had retained filed a notice of appeal of that decision with the board of equalization, which affirmed the decision. The matter was then appealed to the trial court, where the board moved to dismiss the appeal because the notice of appeal of its decision to the board of equalization was not filed by an attorney. Nothing in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 48-5-311 required that such a notice be filed by an attorney. The statute was silent as to who had to file the required notice of appeal of the board's decision, creating an ambiguity. This ambiguity in the taxing statute had to be resolved in favor of the club. The tax consulting firm's filing of the notice of appeal with the board was not the unauthorized practice of law, as the board was not a court of record but a quasi-judicial administrative body. The board waived any right to raise this objection by allowing the club's appeal to pass through the administrative appeal process without raising it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state trooper stopped defendants' vehicle for a seatbelt violation. The videotape of the stop showed the trooper immediately asked one defendant numerous questions unrelated to the seatbelt violation. The trooper repeatedly asked to search that defendant's pockets; when he did he discovered a plastic pill vial containing what the officer believed to be cocaine residue. The trooper then questioned the other defendant, arrested both for the pill vial, and found a package of cocaine in the vehicle's trunk. On appeal of the trial court's order, the instant court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not err by concluding that the detention was unauthorized. Because a defendant's consent to search his person was the product of the illegal detention, it was not valid. Because the cocaine residue and package were located as a result of the illegal search of that defendant, the trial court properly granted the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

Appellant learned that the two individuals had invested her money in high-risk, highly-speculative funds. Appellant contacted appellee to discuss her possible causes of action. Appellant and appellee signed a written retainer agreement. Appellant conceded that her potential claims against the investment group expired no later than February of 1993. Thus, her malpractice claims against appellees should have been filed by February of 1997. However, she argued, the statute was tolled by the appellees' fraud, which she discovered in June of 1994. Even if the appellate court were to assume, without deciding, that appellant was correct, the statute of limitation on her claim against appellees expired four years from her discovery of the fraud. Appellant's claim, which was filed in November of 1998, was time-barred.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the appellate court reversed appellant's convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol to the extent she was a less safe driver and driving under the influence of drugs. Additionally, the appellate court found that the failure to yield was a lesser-included offense of second degree vehicular homicide, the two offenses merged, and appellant could not be convicted of both.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A child's parents were killed when she was seven years old. Her grandmother, appellant, applied for guardianship and was appointed as the child's temporary personal guardian. The child's aunt and uncle, appellees, then intervened, objecting to appellant's appointment and seeking to have themselves appointed as guardians. Finding that appellant was not &quot;unobjectionable,&quot; the juvenile court appointed appellees as the child's personal guardians. On appeal, appellant contended the juvenile court was required to appoint her as guardian pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 29-4-8 because she was the child's next of kin. Judgment was affirmed. Regardless of whether the objections to appellant's appointment as guardian described by the juvenile court would have rendered appellant an &quot;unfit parent,&quot; concerns over appellant's ability to properly raise children, grounded in her actual experience with her own children, were sufficient to deprive appellant of the absolute right to appointment set forth in &sect; 29-4-8 in the circumstances of this case. The juvenile court did not err in granting guardianship to appellees based on the best interest of the child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Appellant, an applicant for guardianship of her granddaughter, was not entitled to the statutory absolute preference granted to unobjectionable next of kin. Appellant had not exhibited good parenting skills in regard to her two living children and had led an inappropriate life style in the presence of minors in the past. The appointment of appellees as personal guardians was in the best interest of the child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Fulton County (Georgia) entered final judgment against appellant after it determined that an ad valorem tax assessment properly included consigned goods despite the fact that the consigned goods were only in Georgia on a short, temporary basis. Appellant challenged that judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant jewelry store owned and operated a business in Fulton County, Georgia. Part of appellant's inventory consisted of consignment items belonging to companies located in other states. Appellant either sold the jewelry and gave the consignor a reference price or returned the jewelry to the consignor. The jewelry remained the property of the consignor, who was able to recall it at any time. The consignment jewelry typically spent from 3 to 90 days at appellant's store before either being sold or returned. Appellee state tax assessor included appellant's consigned items in appellee's ad valorem tax assessment. Appellant contended the Georgia ad valorem tax could not be applied to an agent for consigned merchandise owned by out-of-state residents but offered for sale in Fulton County. After the trial court determined the tax assessment properly included the consigned goods, the appellate court found the fact the consigned property was only briefly present in Georgia was immaterial, as Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 48-5-16(b) allowed for taxation of such property and did not require the property be in Georgia for any particular length of time before such taxation was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed as the trial court did not commit error in holding consigned personal property owned by out-of-state consignors and held for only short periods of time by appellant for sale to its customers was subject to Georgia ad valorem taxation. Georgia statutory law explicitly required such property be made available for taxation and did not impose a particular length of time the property had to be present in Georgia to be taxed.</SPAN></P>

The original citations and one count were nolle prossed, and appellant was tried on an amended count and an original count. Appellant was convicted. The appellate court affirmed, holding that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-7-71(f) permitted the amendment of the accusation. Furthermore, the roadblock was constitutional under U.S. Const. amend. IV in that the screening officer at the roadblock was sufficiently trained and experienced to screen for drivers who should be given field sobriety tests.

The officer stated that appellant's behavior and speech were erratic and he smelled of alcohol. Based on appellant's behavior and his admissions, the officer arrested him for driving under the influence. The court found that Ga.

Having correctly given the implied consent warning at the time of arrest, the officer was under no duty to give further warnings. Thus, any subsequent warning that was incomplete was harmless error. Because the finding that the initial testing results were more reliable was not clearly erroneous, it was affirmed on appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Cobb State Court, Georgia, convicting him of shoplifting and simple battery based on evidence which showed that he took a sweater from a store and then kicked the loss prevention officer who had followed him into the parking lot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant shoplifted a sweater from a store. The store's loss prevention officer testified that he observed the theft on a surveillance camera and, pursuant to store policy, waited until appellant exited the store before attempting to apprehend him. Appellant contended that the trial court denied him a fair trial by forcing him to proceed to trial unprepared. However, not only did appellant fail to move for a continuance, he filed a demand for a disposition of his accusation pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 42-6-5. Because appellant did not contend that he was unprepared for trial until after the state cross-examined him, he could not raise that point on appeal. Because the requested jury charge required the trial court to infer the offenses appellant wished the trial court to charge, the trial court did not err in refusing to give appellant's requested jury charge. Appellant's sentence was not unconstitutional because it was authorized by &sect; 17-10-3(a). Because appellant had no objection to the jury charge that was given regarding simple battery, he waived any objection to that charge on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; appellant did not move for a continuance; thus, he was not forced to proceed to trial unprepared. Also, trial court properly refused to instruct the jury regarding appellant's requested jury charge. Appellant's sentence was not unconstitutional because it was authorized by statute.</SPAN></P>

The court found no abuse of discretion by the trial court and affirmed all of its rulings. The trial court did not err in determining the amount plaintiff owed defendant county for attorneys' fees without holding an evidentiary hearing, as plaintiff did not request an evidentiary hearing and she consented to a court-ordered audit. Plaintiff could not raise on appeal questions she failed to raise below. The trial court was authorized to order plaintiff to return the fees and commissions she retained unlawfully.

The court overruled its decision in Young v. Yarn, 136 Ga. App. 737, 222 S.E.2d 113 (1975), upon which the trial court had relied, and adopted the common law doctrine of informed consent.  Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 31-9-6 concerned the principle of basic consent to medical treatment, and the Young standard had incorrectly concluded that &sect; 31-9-6 precluded recognition of the principle of informed consent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff hospitals sued defendant state medical agency claiming that Medicaid reimbursements to the plaintiffs breached the terms of their respective provider agreements.

The parties appealed and cross-appealed. The court found that the undisputed failure to conduct a fact finding process to identify efficiently and economically operated facilities was a procedural violation of the Boren Amendment. Failure to comply with procedural requirements rendered the state's Medicaid plan invalid. The court vacated the order denying summary judgment on damages and clarified that correct approach on remand would have been to measure damages by the valid reimbursement plan that pre-existed the invalid plan. The reimbursement methodology which violated the Boren Amendment did not constitute a taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed from a grant of summary judgment for defendant property owner by a Georgia trial court in plaintiffs' suit for a declaration as to the zoning status of property owned by defendant property owner. The suit arose from a dispute over the effect of a rezoning vote by defendant DeKalb County Board of Commissioners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant property owner applied for rezoning of his property, and members of defendant board voted four to three in favor. The DeKalb County Organizational Act, 1981 Ga. Laws 4304, 4311, required that either the member representing the district in which the property was located or a member elected from the county at large was required to vote in favor in order to approve a zoning ordinance. The member who represented the district voted against rezoning. There were no at large members, but the county had been divided into two &quot;superdistricts&quot; and one superdistrict commissioner voted in favor. Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that defendant board's vote resulted in denial of the rezoning application. The trial court found that the suit was an untimely appeal of a zoning decision and that plaintiffs lacked standing. The appellate court reversed because plaintiffs were not seeking to reverse the zoning decision, but instead sought a declaration as to the effect of that decision. Therefore, time limits and standing requirements for zoning appeals did not apply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was reversed and remanded for consideration of whether plaintiffs had standing under the Declaratory Judgment Act; that is, whether plaintiffs had the ability to prevent development of the property in violation of its zoning status, and whether that ability would be jeopardized by the trial court's failure to declare the zoning status.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought suit against defendant transit authority and defendant bus driver for injuries she sustained from a fall which occurred while she was a passenger on a city bus. The jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants. Plaintiff appealed and claimed the trial court erred in refusing to give requested jury charges, erred in instructing the jury on the duty of a carrier, and erred by not admitting certain medical records. The court found the trial court did not err in failing to define the term &quot;extraordinary diligence&quot; in its jury instructions, since the term was self-explanatory. The trial court did not err in failing to give the requested jury charge on the presumption of negligence and did not err in failing to give a complete charge explaining the plaintiff's burden of proof, because plaintiff failed to meet her burden of proof and a verdict for defendants would have been authorized even with the complete charge. The court also found the trial court did not abuse its discretion by rejecting a medical records exhibit because it contained portions clearly not relevant to any injuries sustained as a result of her fall or those portions objected to as hearsay.</SPAN></P>

The court found that because defendants' car had South Carolina license plates, and the Georgia window tint statute expressly excluded cars not registered in Georgia, the deputies had no probable cause based on that statute to stop defendants' car. Furthermore, driving a car with illegally tinted windows did not support a rational inference that the car's occupants were drug users or dealers. Judgment was reversed because the motion to suppress should have been granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendants' convictions, because the search of their car which resulted in the seizure of marijuana was illegal as having been made without probable cause for the initial stop.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee's personnel policies provided that in certain cases, employees could be disciplined immediately.

Thus, he was not entitled to summary judgment on that issue. The trial court correctly granted summary judgment to appellee on the due process and impairment issues. The trial court's order purporting to supplement the judgment as to the impairment claim, which issue was being considered in the appellate court, was a nullity and must be vacated. On remand, the trial court was directed to enter an order on appellee's summary judgment motion consistent with this opinion. The judgment in appellant's first case was affirmed; the judgment in the second case was vacated and remanded with direction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged a decision of the Butts Superior Court (Georgia) granting appellees' motion for summary judgment regarding appellants' claim for attorney fees, costs, and expenses in a zoning dispute. In a related case, appellees challenged a decision that a jury would consider whether appellees acted arbitrarily in refusing to rezone appellants' property. The appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellees refused appellants' rezoning requests, appellants brought various state and federal law claims. Those claims were either voluntarily dismissed or judgment was entered for appellees, except for a declaratory judgment action to determine the constitutionality of appellee city's zoning ordinance as applied to appellants' property. The appellate court found that appellants' failure to comply with the ante litem notice requirement of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 36-33-5 precluded them from claiming attorney fees and costs of litigation under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 13-6-11. Nor were appellants entitled to attorney fees and costs under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1988, because the refusal to rezone did not deprive appellants of all use of the property and did not violate equal protection. The trial court did err in stating that the remaining issue was whether appellee city acted arbitrarily in refusing to rezone appellants' property, because the issue was whether the zoning ordinance applicable to the property was constitutional. The constitutionality of the zoning ordinance was a question of law for the court, not a question of fact for a jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's grant of appellees' summary judgment motion regarding appellants' attorney fees claim was affirmed because appellants had failed to give required ante litem notice and had no takings or equal protection claim. The trial court's ruling concerning the remaining issue in the case was reversed because it was improperly formulated and was a question for the court rather than a jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for threatening two towing company employees who were attempting to tow his vehicle. On appeal, the court affirmed. Because appellant admitted threatening the employees and the employees testified that they were in fear of their safety, the evidence was sufficient to support his disorderly conduct conviction. The trial court did not err by proceeding with appellant's trial on an accusation instead of a warrant because appellant was charged with a misdemeanor, he was arrested for the charged offenses at the scene, and the accusation was not used as the basis for the issuance of an arrest warrant. Even though the officer was not present when appellant threatened the employees, appellant's warrantless arrest was justified because the arrest occurred immediately after appellant admitting to making the threat. The trial court did not err by admitting the testimony of a detective not identified on the State's witness list because appellant failed to file his demand for discovery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because the evidence was sufficient to support appellant's conviction, the trial court properly proceeding with appellant's trial on an accusation instead of a warrant, appellant's warrantless arrest was justified even though the officer was not present at the scene, and testimony of a detective was properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After plaintiff airline filed its 1997 business personal property report, defendant county Board of Tax Assessors returned an assessment notice denying its claims for a freeport exemption from ad valorem taxation for inventory in three categories, and disallowing its valuation of certain airplane parts. Plaintiff unsuccessfully appealed to the Clayton County Board of Equalization and then to superior court. Both parties sought summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment to defendant on the freeport exemption issue but denied it on valuation. Both sides appealed. The court reversed summary judgment on the freeport exemption, but affirmed denial of summary judgment on valuation, finding both issues should have properly gone to the jury. Plaintiff produced admissible, probative evidence supporting its property valuation. It also presented adequate evidence that no inventory was on hand longer than 12 months. The trial court erred by not granting plaintiff summary judgment on whether engines undergoing heavy maintenance qualified for exemption. A jury issue remained respecting engines undergoing light maintenance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Grant of summary judgment to defendant was reversed, as freeport exemption was available for certain of plaintiff's aircraft engines and parts, and whether various engines and parts warranted exemption was question of fact. Denial of summary judgment to defendant was affirmed, as plaintiff presented triable issues of fact regarding valuation of its personal property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a 12 year-old juvenile, told officers that she had been sexually involved with teenage boys. A juvenile court consequently found that appellant was delinquent. Appellant referred to statutory rape laws in arguing that she could not be delinquent because of her actions since she could not consent to sex. The court found that appellant could not combine the areas of law she sought to combine in order to make that defense. While consent was not a defense to statutory rape, it had no impact on whether a juvenile committed a delinquent act. Appellant claimed that she did not realize that she could be charged from her statements and claimed that her statement was therefore not knowingly and intelligently waived. During her police interview, appellant's parents were present and the officer informed her that her statements could be used against her. On appeal, after reviewing the totality of the circumstances, the court determined that the trial court's finding that the statement was voluntary was not clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

Appellant claimed it did not have to comply with the order because respondent's contract with its auditor was unconstitutional; however, the court disagreed because appellant failed to show that respondent's delegation of its authority was beyond what state law allowed. Appellant also claimed the contract between respondent and the auditor violated public policy because the auditor testified against appellant in other counties, but nothing in the record demonstrated that the auditor would use the subpoenaed information in other counties.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions and sentence arising from his use of gasoline and a lit cigarette to threaten a cashier, from whom defendant took cash, personal property, and a car. The instant court affirmed the convictions, but reversed the sentence in part. Reasonable jurors could have found that defendant guilty of using an offensive weapon for purposes of the armed robbery statute. For purposes of the aggravated assault statute, the jury was authorized to use common sense to find that the cigarette, in conjunction with the gasoline, constituted an offensive weapon likely to cause serious bodily injury. Although the victim was not in his car when defendant threatened, the jury was authorized to find defendant took the car from the victim's &quot;person or presence.&quot; The trial court should have merged the two robbery convictions for purposes of sentencing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent foreclosed on petitioner's property after she defaulted under the terms of the security deed. Respondent, as the highest bidder, purchased the property in the foreclosure sale. Respondent demanded possession of the property following the foreclosure sale; however, petitioner refused to relinquish possession. Respondent filed a dispossessory action; petitioner filed a counterclaim alleging wrongful foreclosure. The trial court granted respondent's motion for summary judgment. The instant court affirmed, finding that petitioner was properly served with the dispossessory warrant and was provided adequate notice of the hearing. Further, petitioner could not attack dispossession without first setting aside the foreclosure and deed. Petitioner waived her constitutional challenges to statutes governing dispossessory proceedings, and such arguments had previously been rejected on appeal. Finally, the trial court did not err in denying petitioner's motion to transfer the proceeding to superior court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant physician was disciplined for engaging in acts of sexual intimacy with a patient, other than his wife.

The appellate court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of appellant's complaint. Appellant had not alleged that he was currently providing medical treatment to his wife, that he planned to provide such treatment in the future, or even that he wanted to do so. There was no evidence appellee interpreted or would have interpreted the rule to preclude a physician from rendering medical care to a spouse.

As to alleged error in the trial court's failure to give a requested jury instruction, the issue was waived by defendant's failure to object in the trial court. Also, the trial court did not err in failing to limit the punitive damage award pursuant to Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an in rem judicial tax foreclosure action, plaintiff was not entitled to intervene under Ga.

No statute conferred upon her an unconditional right and she did not fit within the definition of interested party under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 48-4-77(1), the ad valorem tax foreclosure statute. Although appellant claimed an interest in the subject property by virtue of a deed, the deed was not in recordable form and was not recorded; thus, appellant's interest was not reasonably ascertainable from courthouse or tax records. Therefore, appellant was not entitled to notice, she had no standing, and she was not entitled to intervene, particularly after the tax foreclosure sale had taken place and the property had been sold to a third party. Notice had been given to all those entitled to notice, including posting a notice on the property. Appellant's assertion that the trial court erred in not declaring unconstitutional the judicial in rem tax foreclosure statute had not been raised below and could not be considered on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant driver appealed his conviction for driving with a suspended license, challenging the Georgia court's jurisdiction to convict him and the constitutionality of the prosecution. The court found that there was ample testimony and evidence showing defendant to be a resident of Georgia and that he was driving his car on a Georgia public highway while his license was suspended when he was arrested. Under its police power, the State of Georgia had authority to regulate the operation of motor vehicles on Georgia public highways, and any attack of its police power as unconstitutional was without merit. Defendant's claim that he was not given adequate notice of his re-sentencing hearing was rejected because the record showed that the hearing was held over one week after notice was mailed to defendant. Defendant's argument that his driver's license was suspended in error based on expunged prior convictions or charges subject to collateral attack was also rejected. There was no evidence to support the claim, and the conviction for driving with a suspended license was based on an offense separate and apart from prior offenses that led to the suspension.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant driver's conviction for driving with a suspended license was affirmed because the evidence showed defendant was a resident of Georgia and was driving with a suspended license on Georgia public highways when he was arrested, giving a Georgia court jurisdiction to try the case. Defendant's constitutional challenge failed as well, because the state had authority under its police power to regulate the use of motor vehicles on state roads.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendants argued the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction, the award of attorney fees was error, and the judgment did not conform to the issues raised in the pleadings. The appellate court affirmed in part. Subject matter jurisdiction existed because the disposition was not inconsistent with the church's religious freedom to determine its own governmental rules and regulations. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees; the defense asserted lacked merit and had to have been asserted for the sole purpose of delay or harassment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued defendant emergency medical technicians, alleging that she suffered damages because defendants failed to take her to the hospital after responding to her 911 call, and that the defendants failed to perform ministerial duties, acted in bad faith, and acted outside the scope of their authority.

The parties did not dispute that defendants were employees of the county, which was licensed to provide ambulance services. If defendants rendered emergency care to plaintiff in good faith, they were entitled to immunity from plaintiff's claims.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of child molestation and enticing a child for indecent purposes. Defendant contended the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of child molestation. The evidence was sufficient to find defendant guilty. Defendant's claim that the touching lasted a split second was contradicted by the child's claim that he tickled her private parts by moving his finger back and forth. Defendant's account of the accidental touching was inconsistent with his original statement to the police. It was unnecessary to consider whether the evidence supported the jury's verdict of enticing a child for indecent purposes, because it merged with the child molestation.  Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 24-3-16 did not limit the admissibility of evidence to when the child victim's veracity was in question or to when the child was unresponsive. The jury instruction did not require the jury to acquit defendant of child molestation before considering the lesser-included offense of sexual battery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee pled guilty and was sentenced on two counts of committing sodomy in violation of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-6-2. After appellee moved for reconsideration of the sentences, a trial court granted the motion, vacated the sodomy sentences, and declared the sodomy convictions void. The State appealed to the Georgia Supreme Court, which transferred the case to this court because they had previously struck down Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-6-2 as unconstitutional insofar as it applied to private, unforced, noncommercial acts of sodomy between consenting persons. The court affirmed the trial court's decision, finding that the acts complained of were between people with the ability to give consent, even though the person appellee received consent from was, at the earliest incident, a 15-year-old student of hers. There was no statute prohibiting such acts between high school student and teacher and there was no question that consent was received.</SPAN></P>

Appellant mother challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the juvenile court's determination to terminate her parental rights. The appellate court affirmed, holding that requiring fathers of children born out of wedlock to legitimate their children in order to preserve their parental rights did not violate equal protection because unwed fathers and unwed mothers were not similarly situated. The appellate court further held that clear and convincing evidence supported finding of parental misconduct or inability under Ga.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed the order of the Fulton Superior Court (Georgia), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendant hospital in plaintiff's suit to recover fees charged in excess of the flat fee agreement between defendant hospital and defendant health insurance carrier.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was injured by tortfeasor and treated by defendant hospital. Plaintiff paid a portion of her medical expenses from settlement proceeds received from tortfeasor. Plaintiff filed suit based on defendant hospital's recovery of more than the flat fee in defendants' payment agreement. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant hospital. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant had a valid lien on plaintiff's cause of action against tortfeasor. The record revealed a bill showing services provided and their costs, a guaranty of payment executed by plaintiff, and payment. Because plaintiff satisfied defendant's lien in full without objecting, the court held that she waived her right to challenge the lien. The court held that defendant was not required to pay a pro-rata share of the attorney fees plaintiff incurred in obtaining settlement from tortfeasor. The court reversed summary judgment on defendant's counterclaim for declaratory relief and dismissed the counterclaim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed as to defendant's recovery in excess of flat fee, because plaintiff waived her right to challenge defendant's lien by satisfying it in full without objection, and because defendant was not required to pay a pro-rata share of plaintiff's attorney fees. Judgment reversed as to defendant's counterclaim; counterclaim dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-4-2(c) was the statute by which declaratory relief was available. Appellant, however, had to demonstrate facts or circumstances whereby he was in a position of uncertainty or insecurity because of a dispute and of having to take some future action that was properly incident to its alleged right, and which future action without direction from a court might reasonably jeopardize his interest. Appellant acknowledged that he had neither been charged with violation of the statute, nor had there been any showing of intent by authorities to take any action pursuant to the statute. He argued, nonetheless, that there was an actual controversy. The court held that appellant had not alleged any facts that could be said to be in any way similar to other actions where declaratory judgment was permitted. Instead, appellant's challenge was merely anticipatory. Therefore, appellant had no standing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that the statute,&nbsp;Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 48-7-24(a) was unambiguous and plainly applied to appellees and the partnerships in which they invested. The court found that the literal meaning of the statute was where a partnership did business in Georgia, its individual members were taxable on their share of the net profits of the partnership - regardless of whether the individual members qualified as doing business in Georgia. The court read it as not excusing appellees from paying taxes on their share of the profits of the limited partnerships even though they did not individually do business in Georgia. Because the stipulated facts showed that the limited partnerships at issue engaged in an activity for the purpose of financial gain or profit, Georgia law deemed them to be doing business in Georgia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictment charged appellant with committing various acts of rape and molestation. Over hearsay objection, Department of Family and Children Service's (DFACS) investigator testified to statements the children made which were consistent with their trial testimony. The investigating police officer also testified to out-of-court statements made by the children that were consistent with their testimony at trial. Appellee's case turned on the credibility of testimony given by prosecution witnesses, primarily victim and sister. The testimony of a number of defense witnesses raised serious questions as to the credibility of these children. The improper bolstering of their credibility with the hearsay testimony added critical weight to appellee's case and did contribute to the verdict. Even if the officer's testimony as to the victim's out-of-court statements was admissible under the Child Hearsay Statute,&nbsp;Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 24-3-16, the improper admission of the hearsay statements of her sister required reversal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed; the court held that appellee improperly bolstered the victim's credibility by allowing the investigating officer and the Department of Family and Children Service's investigator to testify to consistency of her statements.
