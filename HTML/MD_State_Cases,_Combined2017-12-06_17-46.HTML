<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-The trial court erred in granting the prosecution's Batson challenge, as defense counsel provided valid, race neutral explanations for his strikes of white panel members, and the court improperly relied on counsel's pattern from prior trials in finding that his explanations were a pretext for racial discrimination, because it in doing so it went outside of the record, precluding appellate review of its findings of fact; [2]-Defendant's conviction of attempted second-degree murder could not stand because the evidence did not establish that he formed the specific intent to kill the cyclist he hit with his car, since his actions could be wholly explained by his trying to flee the police, and the death of the cyclist was not a probable consequence of defendant's recklessly driving away from the police.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 7-109, the Court of Special Appeals was authorized to reverse that decision upon finding that the circuit court committed an abuse of discretion; [3]-The circuit court's denial of an inmate's motion to reopen his PCP was an abuse of discretion because the jurors were given advisory only instructions, which constituted structural error that entitled him to a new trial.</SPAN></P>

State, 427 Md. 383 (2012), as it was not clearly wrong and not &quot;archaic&quot; in holding that prior decisions regarding the interpretation of Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 23 advisory only jury instructions created a new State constitutional standard that was to be applied retroactively to all cases in which there were advisory only jury instructions; [2]-An inmate's motion to reopen his postconviction relief petition was properly granted under Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 7-106(c)(2) (2001, Repl. Vol. 2008) because the change in the law under Unger met the &quot;interests of justice&quot; standard, such that relitigation of the constitutionality of the inmate's conviction based on a guilty verdict by a jury that was given an advisory only instruction was warranted.</SPAN></P>

HOLDINGS: [1]-Section 8-611 was not facially overbroad because it did not criminalize the display or distribution of goods that had no retail value and were not meant to be sold; thus, it did not criminalize conduct that U.S. Const. amend. I's Free Speech Clause indisputably protected, such as the mere display of signs or distribution of pamphlets; [2]-Section 8-611 was not facially void for vagueness because its prohibitions of acts involving &quot;intellectual property&quot; were clearly defined, and there was no need to guess at &sect; 8-611's meaning or to differ as to its application.</SPAN></P>

Vol.), on a tiny island in a Chesapeake Bay tributary had eliminated the owner's ability to develop anything without a variance due to the expanded buffer, and the soil type and erosion had rendered the previous house site unbuildable, resulting in undue hardship; [3]-The Board erred in failing to provide reasonable justification for increasing the impervious surface over that in existence before enactment of the Critical Area Law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff residents were granted certiorari to challenge the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland), which affirmed the dismissal of their case against defendant county by a trial court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court had granted defendant's motion to dismiss, ruling, in part, that plaintiffs lacked standing. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of dismissal, holding that plaintiffs failed to show a concrete injury to their voting rights and thereby lacked standing. The Court upheld the dismissal , finding that while plaintiffs took great pains to characterize their grievance as a deprivation of the right to referendum, the right to vote, and related free speech and association rights, at its core, their complaint was grounded in one thing and one thing only: the allegation that defendant's methods for accomplishing certain decisions violated its own Charter. As such, the Court held that plaintiffs' claim amounted to nothing more than an abstract, generalized interest in defendant's compliance with its Charter, which was shared by all members of the general public in the county. On that ground alone, plaintiffs were held to have failed to establish standing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner registrant filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that he not be required to register as a sex offender under the Maryland sex offender registration statute (SORS), Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 11-701 et seq. (Cum. Supp. 2012), and that he be removed from the Maryland Sex Offender Registry. After a transfer, the trial court denied the requested relief. The Maryland Court of Special Appeals affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court issued a writ of certiorari. A plurality of the state's highest court analyzed the ex post facto issue under Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 17. The registrant committed an underlying child sex offense during the 1983-84 school year. SORS was enacted in 1995. The registrant was charged in 2005, and was required to register as a sex offender under the 2009 and 2010 amendments' retroactive application of the SORS. The disadvantage analysis applied to ex post facto issues under art. 17. The registrant could not have had fair warning of any legally imposed sanctions beyond those provided for at the time of his crime. Imposing registration upon the registrant changed the consequences of the registrant's crime to his disadvantage. The application of the SORS to the registrant in 2009 was the equivalent of imposing the additional criminal sanction of probation or parole for the registrant's prior commission of a sex crime in the 1980's. Under Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 11-707(a)(4) (Cum. Supp. 2012), the registrant had to register for life. The dissemination of the registrant's information pursuant to the SORS was tantamount to shaming for life and was punitive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a plurality opinion, the judgment of the appellate court was reversed. The case was remanded to the appellate court with directions to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to direct the trial court to enter a declaratory judgment consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Maryland State Comptroller of the Treasury appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Howard County (Maryland), which reversed a tax court decision and invalidated an assessment that had not allowed a credit against the county income tax portion of the Maryland individual income tax for income generated by a Subchapter S corporation outside Maryland.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers, a married couple, owned stock in a Subchapter S corporation that did business in multiple states. They reported pass-through income of the corporation on their Maryland tax return and claimed their pro rata share of income taxes paid by the corporation to other states as a credit pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 10-703(c) against their Maryland individual income tax. Pursuant to &sect; 10-703(a), no credit was allowed against the county tax for income taxes paid by the corporation to other states. The court held that the application of the county tax without a credit for pass-through S corporation income taxed in other states discriminated against interstate commerce and thus violated the dormant Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. Although the county income tax was not directed at interstate commerce, its application without a credit for S corporation income taxed in other states could affect the interstate market for capital and business investment by causing Maryland residents to invest only in Maryland businesses. The county tax without a credit was not fairly apportioned because it lacked both internal consistency and external consistency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court and remanded for further proceedings in the tax court.</SPAN></P>

After the dealer extended the customer's warranty, the trial court granted the dealer's motion to deny class certification, granted in part its motion for summary judgment, and awarded the customer attorney's fees. The Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) affirmed. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customer alleged that the dealer misrepresented the term of an extended manufacturer's warranty that he purchased for his car. The customer alleged that he brought the problem to the dealer's attention, but the dealer took no action to remedy it. Once the class action was filed, the dealer tendered individual damages to the customer, and argued that the customer could not prosecute a class action. The first issue before the court of appeals was whether the tender required the court to deny class certification. The court of appeals concluded that it did not, holding that a tender of individual relief to the putative class representative did not moot a class action if the individual plaintiff did not have a reasonable opportunity to seek class certification, including any necessary discovery. The court of appeals also concluded that punitive damages were not foreclosed by the tender of individual compensatory damages. Finally, the court of appeals concluded that the award of attorney's fees was not limited to fees incurred before the tender, as the court considered the dealer's correction of warranties purchased by other customers as within &quot;the results obtained&quot; by counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order granting the dealer's motion to deny class certification was reversed and case was remanded for reconsideration of that issue, as well as the award of punitive damages. The award of attorney's fees was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court for the District of Maryland certified four questions to the court in plaintiff consumers' class action suit alleging that defendants, a licensed exhibitor and several entities that sold tickets to the exhibitor's events, had violated Baltimore City ordinances regulating the sale of tickets to entertainment and sports events.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A consumer purchased a ticket through an online ticket agency and paid a service charge exceeding the 50-cent fee specified in Baltimore, Md., City Code art. 15, &sect; 21-2. The ticket agency's agreement with the exhibitor authorized the ticket agency to make original sales of tickets as the exhibitor's agent. The licensing requirement of Baltimore, Md., City Code art. 15, &sect; 21-1(a) did not apply to the ticket agency because it was acting as the exhibitor's agent. Section 21-1(b), when read in conjunction with Baltimore, Md., City Code art. 15, &sect; 21-3, did not allow the exhibitor to authorize anyone to charge more than the established price. The prohibition against scalping in Baltimore, Md., City Code art. 19, &sect; 55-1(a) applied not only to the resale of tickets, but also to original sales by an exhibitor or its agent. Only a licensed ticket agency was exempted under &sect; 55-1(b) from the prohibition, and only to the extent of collecting the 50-cent fee. A common law action for money had and received could be maintained to recover money paid under an executory illegal contract, under an illegal contract that had been fully executed as to which the parties were in pari delicto.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the ticket agency did not have to be licensed to sell tickets as the exhibitor's agent, but it could sell them only at the established price; that the prohibition against scalping was not limited to the resale of tickets; that only a licensed ticket agency could collect a service charge; and that a common law action for money had and received could be maintained if the ticket sale agreement remained executory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed an order of the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) reversing the denial of defendant's motion to dismiss charges for first-degree attempted murder and lesser included offenses. Defendant had previously been found incompetent to stand trial, committed to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, had the charges dismissed under Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 3-107 (2001, 2008 Rep. Vol., 2012 Cum. Supp.), and been re-indicated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on appeal was whether the State could re-institute criminal charges against a defendant who succeeded in having those charges dismissed under Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 3-107, without some showing that the defendant regained competency. Defendant argued that the State should not be allowed to continue to confine him by simply re-indicting him on the same charges that were required to be dismissed under &sect; 3-107. The State argued that re-institution of charges initially dismissed under &sect; 3-107 was supported by the fact hat the legislature specifically stated that dismissal under &sect; 3-107 was &quot;without prejudice.&quot; The court of appeals held that in order to hold a detainee after a &sect; 3-107 dismissal, the State must show that the detainee was restorable, but nothing in the incompetency statutes required the State to make a restorability showing when it reindicted a defendant. Since neither defendant's counsel, the State, nor the trial court brought up the issue of whether defendant was restorable after nine years of unsuccessful incompetent-to-stand-trial commitment, that determination was to be made on remand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the court of special appeals was vacated and the case was remanded to that court to affirm the denial of defendant's motion to dismiss the charges and remand the case to the trial court to make a required restorability determination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A customer fell on a subway station floor after it was cleaned, and another customer fell on such a floor where water accumulated. The court of appeals held WMATA was immune, under Md.

WMATA did not waive immunity in Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 10-204(75) (2008), requiring it to follow laws of signatories to the WMATA Compact, Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 10-201 et seq., because it had to comply with laws regulating use of streets, highways, other vehicular facilities, and laws regulating traffic control, zoning, signs, and buildings, but did not have to comply with laws governing the use of buildings, signs, or zoning laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, two pedestrians and a spouse, filed slip and fall actions against the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). In the first case, a jury returned a verdict for petitioners; in the second, the Prince County, Maryland, Circuit Court granted WMATA judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The Maryland Court of Special Appeals reversed the judgment in the first case, ruling that WMATA had immunity. Petitioners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both pedestrians slipped and fell on water on the floor of WMATA's metro-rail stations. The high court held that WMATA's decision in the first case to clean the entire station floor, and in the second, to allow water to evaporate instead of mopping it up, were based on policy and economic decisions related to the most efficient method for conducting maintenance operations. Therefore, pursuant to &sect; 80 (Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 10-204(80)) of the WMATA Compact, WMATA had immunity because its determinations were based on economic and policy considerations. Section 75 (Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 10-204(75) (2008)) of the WMATA Compact required WMATA to comply with the laws regulating the use of streets, highways, and all other vehicular facilities, as well as the laws regulating traffic control, zoning, signs, and buildings. It did not require WMATA to comply with laws governing the use of buildings, the use of signs, or the use of zoning laws. Accordingly, &sect; 75 did not act to waive WMATA's immunity in the second case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments of the trial court in the second case and of the intermediate appellate court in the first case were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals held the charter provision was not unconstitutional, under Md. Const. art. XI-A, &sect; 3, because it simply required the council to implement an award in the next year's budget. The charter provision did not violate Md. Const. art. XI-A by including an entire statute in the charter because it left fleshing out of its directive to the county council. The voters' directive to implement binding arbitration in the budget process was not unconstitutional, under Md. Const. art. XI-A, &sect; 3, because it did not implicate the council's law-making power. The amendment's attempted repeal of the implementing ordinance was invalid because it violated Anne Arundel County, Md., Charter &sect; 812, mandating an ordinance adopting binding arbitration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Cecil County (Maryland), which reversed a decision of an administrative law judge (ALJ). The ALJ had found that a driver had refused to take a breath test under Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 16-205.1, and she imposed mandatory driver's license suspensions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver's vehicle was stopped for speeding and due to his appearance and failure on a field sobriety test, he was arrested. He agreed to submit to an alcohol concentration test but did not produce a reading despite seven attempts to blow into the Intoximeter. A hearing was held before the ALJ, who determined that the test technician (TT) established a prima facie case of refusal under &sect; 16-205.1, and that the driver did not testify to any medical problems that might have affected the test. She found the TT more credible than the driver, and concluded that he had refused to take the test. The trial court reversed the ALJ's determination, finding that there was insufficient evidence of test refusal. On further review, the court found a lack of substantial evidence under Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 10-222(h) (1957, 2009) to support the trial court's decision. It held that the TT's certification of the driver's refusal, together with evidence that the testing procedure had been explained to him and that the driver appeared to be in good health, established prima facie proof of a refusal. The driver failed to overcome the refusal presumption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the matter with instructions to affirm the decision of the ALJ.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the denial of his motion to suppress DNA evidence, defendant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the denial of his motion to suppress, claiming that, as a DWI probationer who had previously declined police requests to seize and test his DNA, he did not voluntarily surrender his breath for DNA testing when state officers seized his DNA on the false pretense of testing only his blood alcohol. The court of appeals held that defendant, as person on probation from a drunken driving offense, had a significantly diminished expectation of privacy, even when the new crime under investigation for was not related to the one that led to probation. Defendant forfeited much of his right to privacy, if only for a limited time, by accepting probation for his earlier sentence. It was a key factor that defendant's DNA was collected during his regular, probation-mandated testing for alcohol abuse. Defendant also challenged the sufficiency of the evidence against him. The court of appeals found sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction, noting that defendant's semen was found inside the victim's vagina and anus, permitting an inference he was the last one to have sex with her, she remained in a supine position after he violated her, and thus, he killed her.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) affirmed, and the mother sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother said the parties were told, one week before a custody hearing, that a custody evaluation (1) could be viewed at the court clerk's office, and (2) could not be copied.

The policy's lack of justification was significant because (1) the report was a &quot;case record,&quot; under Md. R. 16-1001(c)(1)(A) and (e)(3), so Md. R. 16-1009(d)(2) required certain findings before limiting access to it, and (2) the record showed no balancing of interests, whether less restrictive alternatives were considered, or any reasons to bar counsel from receiving a copy of it. The policy impeded counsel's ability to know the evidence and contest it because counsel (1) could access the report pre-hearing only in the clerk's office during public hours, (2) could not make verbatim notes of extensive passages from it, and (3) could not make or receive copies of any part of it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The borrower said dismissal was required because the lender's Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 7-105.1(c) notice of intent to foreclose did not state all secured parties. The court of appeals held, in general, the notice should list all secured parties because the statutory purpose to give a borrower advance notice and information to negotiate an alternative to foreclosure was best served by identifying all secured parties, particularly any sharing in the proceeds of a foreclosure sale. Under the facts, the notice's failure to disclose a secured party did not require dismissal because the borrower was not deceived or otherwise treated unfairly, as (1) advance warning of foreclosure proceedings was given over four months before the foreclosure action was filed, (2) the notice let her seek loan modification, (3) the undisclosed secured party's loan ownership was disclosed nearly 18 months before the foreclosure sale, and she did not move to dismiss due to this party's absence from the notice of intent to foreclose for over a year after disclosure of its loan ownership, and (4) Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 7-105.1(c) was ambiguous on whether disclosure of this secured party was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said the Court of Special Appeals could not hear the State's appeal because it did not appeal an order providing relief. The court of appeals disagreed because a later order only clarified the order the State appealed. Excluding mental impairment evidence did not entitle him to postconviction relief because (1) a case used to exclude the evidence did not bar all such evidence, so later cases admitting such evidence established no new &quot;rule,&quot; under Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 7-106(c)(2)(i) (2008), and, (2) he did not show the earlier case prejudiced him in a way the later cases would have ameliorated, under Md. R. 4-402(a)(3) and (4). His first-degree murder sentence of life, suspend all but 50 years, converted by operation of law into a 50-year term-of-years sentence, was illegal because the minimum sentence was life imprisonment. The trial court had to impose life imprisonment, all but 50 years suspended, followed by probation, because it was limited by the maximum legal sentence that could have been imposed. His 50-year rape sentence was not illegal for exceeding his life expectancy because it ended at the end of his life.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent driver sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Washington County (Maryland) of the suspension of his driver's license, under Md. Code Ann., &sect; 16-205.1(b)(1)(i)(2)(A) (2009). The trial court reversed the suspension, finding a form DR-15A stated insufficient grounds for stopping the driver's vehicle, and petitioner Motor Vehicle Administration sought further review, under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 12-305 (2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An administrative law judge (ALJ) suspended the driver's license because a DR-15A form stating why an officer suspected intoxicated driving and an official blood alcohol test constituted a prima facie case. The court of appeals held it was error to reverse that decision when the DR-15A form did not state why the driver was stopped because (1) the form and blood test were prima facie evidence of a violation of Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 16-205.1 (2009), and (2) the form, based on the statute, only required the officer to state why he reasonably believed the driver was intoxicated, which he sufficiently did. An alcohol influence report was admissible at an administrative hearing as corroborative evidence, under Md. Code Regs. 11.11.02.10(A) (2012), because it (1) was a probative document used in conducting a reasonable police officer's duties, and (2) made it more likely the officer reasonably believed the driver drove while intoxicated. The ALJ could rely on this belief because the driver did not show the officer's bad faith by (1) seeking a subpoena for the officer or (2) presenting other evidence of bad faith.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded to that court with instructions to affirm the decision of the administrative law judge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The members said a &quot;sufficient cumulative information&quot; standard applied to find if enough petition signatures were submitted. The court of appeals disagreed because (1) the requirements of Md. Code Ann., Elec.

This standard did not bind respondents under the offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel doctrine because (1) Maryland did not recognize the doctrine, (2) a judgment applying the standard was inconsistent with precedent, and (3) it was unfair to bind respondents to this incorrect judgment. Md. Code Ann., Elec. Law &sect; 6-203(a) (2010) and Md. Code Regs. 33.06.03.06(B)(1) did not violate Md. Const. Decl.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate filed a petition under the Maryland Uniform Postconviction Procedure Act, Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 7-101 et seq. The postconviction court vacated the inmate's convictions and granted him a new trial. The Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) granted the State's application for leave to appeal and vacated the postconviction court's order. The inmate filed a petition for a writ of certiorari. The State filed a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State claimed that the court of special appeals' denial of the inmate's application for leave to appeal brought the case within Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 12-202 (1) (1974, 2006 Repl. Vol.). The court of appeals disagreed, noting that the inmate's cross-application for leave to appeal was improper and, even if such an application were necessary, the judgment of the court of special appeals would not come within the ambit of &sect; 12-202. As for the merits of the issue before it, the court of appeals held that the trial court's instructions at the inmate's trial, telling the jury that all of the court's instructions on legal matters were &quot;merely advisory,&quot; were clearly in error, at least as applied to matters implicating federal constitutional rights. The opinions in Stevenson v. State, 289 Md. 167, 423 A.2d 558 (1980) and Montgomery v. State, 292 Md. 84, 89, 437 A.2d 654, 657 (1981) set forth a new interpretation of Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 23, and established a new constitutional standard. Thus, counsel's failure to object to the advisory nature of the judge's instructions did not amount to deficient representation at the time of the inmate's trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's motion to dismiss was denied. The judgment of the court of special appeals was reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child at issue was conceived after the mother and her husband separated but before they were divorced, during a time when the mother and the putative father were engaged in a sexual relationship, and was born after the mother and the husband were divorced. At the time the child was born, the mother and the putative father were no longer in a relationship and the husband informed the mother that he wanted to be the baby's father and he took on that role. The issue before the court of appeals was whether a man who claimed to be the father of a child conceived while the mother was married to another man, but born after the mother and her husband divorced, had an unconditional right to genetic testing to determine whether he is the biological father. The court of appeals held that, under the facts given, the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion by considering the best interests of the child when rejecting the requested blood testing. Merely claiming to be the father did not overcome the presumption of legitimacy based on the time of conception.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the employee, who was terminated as Maryland's State Public Defender, maintained that the trial court erroneously granted the State's motion to dismiss because, under its jurisprudence regarding wrongful discharge, the employee pleaded properly the elements of that cause of action, including that the Board of Trustees's demands of her for action were ultra vires and illegal. The court of appeals concluded that the employee's complaint was barred by the doctrine of administrative exhaustion. The employee failed to exhaust the available and primary administrative remedy provided to at-will executive service State employees under Md. Code Ann., State Pers. &amp; Pens. &sect; 11-305 (1994, 2009 Repl. Vol.). Contrary to the employee's claim, the State was not required to provide the employee with written notice of the availability of the administrative remedy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said it was error to deny his voluntary intoxication instruction request. The court of appeals held it was not an abuse of discretion to deny the request because (1) evidence of his alcohol consumption, blood alcohol content, memory loss, testimony that he was &quot;almost about to pass out,&quot; and the illogical way his crime was committed did not let a jury rationally conclude he was so severely impaired that he could not form the intent necessary to constitute his crimes, as evidence he was drunk was not also evidence he was unable to form the required specific intent, and (2) some of his actions on the night in question were inconsistent with an intoxication defense, including an ability to speak intelligibly, his design in planning the crimes, and his incomplete memory loss. His objection to testimony of an identifying witness's level of certainty was not preserved for review, under Md. R. 5-103(a) or 4-323, because (1) the trial court gave him a chance to provide specific grounds for the objection, stating the objection would be overruled without them and giving him notice the objection would not be preserved without them, and (2) he declined to offer such grounds.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann., Elec. Law &sect; 6-203 (2002, 2010 Repl. Vol.) regarding validation of petition signatures necessary to regain their ballot access privileges. The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland) granted the political parties' motion for summary judgment. The State Board of Elections appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Md. Code Ann., Elec. Law &sect; 4-102, the political parties enjoyed ballot access privileges for nearly four years when they were unable to show that their respective memberships consisted of at least one percent of registered Maryland voters or that their nominees for Governor received at least one percent of the total vote. Thus, the political parties undertook to obtain 10,000 petition signatures to regain their ballot access privileges. The State Board of Elections found that many of their submitted signatures were invalid under Md. Code Ann., Elec. Law &sect; 6-203. The trial court adopted a sufficient cumulative information standard from which a petition signatory could be identified as a registered voter. However, the trial court misconstrued applicable case law in establishing the new standard; rather, the requirements for petition signatures under &sect; 6-203(a) were mandatory and applied to petitions in both the referendum and new party petition contexts. Lastly, in accordance with the plain and unambiguous language of &sect; 6-203(b), the State Board of Elections appropriately refused to validate and count duplicate signatures of individuals who previously signed the same petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment and remanded the matter to the trial court for entry of a declaratory judgment consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to an ex parte order allowing officers to intercept a mobile phone communication, officers intercepted a call leading to the seizure of controlled substances from defendant. The issue before the court of appeals was whether the court of special appeals erred in affirming the denial of defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized after the police intercepted defendant's phone call from his Virginia phone to a Virginia phone line, in violation of the Maryland Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Act, Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 10-401 et seq. The court of appeals concluded that the interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication, for the purposes of the Maryland wiretap statute, occurs where law enforcement officers capture or redirect first the contents of the communication overheard by the wiretap and where they heard originally the communication. Therefore, since the &quot;listening post&quot; was located within the territorial jurisdiction of the court issuing the ex parte wiretap order, neither the physical location of the mobile phone at the time the call was placed and during the communication or the recipient of the call were material.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner sought a declaration of rights interpreting a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) and declaring a letter from appellee Trust's Director to be ultra vires, ab initio. The property owner appealed the dismissal of its complaint by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) basedon arguments by appellee city, the Trust, and others, that it was not a party to, or an intended beneficiary of, the MOA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted an Urban Renewal Plan. The MOA required the city to submit redevelopment plans to the Trust for review and approval. The Trust's Director and the State Historic Preservation Officer, provided conditional approval of the fifth set of plans. The city agreed to those conditions. The Trust decided not to challenge the conditional approval. The appellate court held that the property owner's current argument was not the same as its claims at issue in two earlier cases. The MOA was not a land use decision with attendant principles extending standing to nearby aggrieved landowners. Thus, the property owner could not rely on the principles that extended standing to an adjoining landowner. It was left only with principles of contract law to establish its entitlement to press a claim for declaratory relief. Therefore, the trial court properly applied principles of contract law. As the property owner was not a party to the MOA and it did not claim a direct right to compensation from the MOA, it was, at best an incidental beneficiary to the MOA. Hence, it could not file a suit requesting declaratory judgment that interprets and enforces an agreement to which it has no part.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held the evidence was insufficient, under then applicable common law, to present the issue of negligence to a jury, but the Court of Special Appeals held the evidence was sufficient.

It was necessary to modify the common law because extensive evidence showed pit bull dogs and cross-bred pit bull dog mixes were responsible for a disproportionate number of serious and often fatal attacks on humans.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals held the statute was unconstitutional, under the Fourth Amendment, as applied to defendant because, given his status as an arrestee entitled to a presumption of innocence, his reasonable expectation of privacy against warrantless, suspicionless searches outweighed the State's interest in assuring his proper identification, since (1) other valid means of identifying him were available, (2) he did not attempt to conceal or alter his identity, and (3) he did not abandon the DNA evidence. Defendant's facial challenge to the statute failed because there were conceivable scenarios where the use of DNA evidence would be needed to identify an arrestee who tried to conceal his or her identity. A subsequent DNA sample obtained from defendant was suppressible as fruit of the poisonous tree because the first sample was used to show probable cause to obtain an order for the second sample.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the State was required to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that (1) he did not have a Maryland driver's license; (2) he was not expressly exempt from the licensing requirements; and (3) he was not specifically authorized to drive vehicles of the class that he was driving. The State countered that the offense was defined by &sect; 16-101(a)(1), and the subsequent exceptions had be raised by defendant as affirmative defenses. The court of appeals held that &sect; 16-101(a)(1) defined the offense, and &sect; 16-101(a)(2) and (a)(3) were not so incorporated into the offense as to constitute part of it. The exceptions outlined in the latter two parts were affirmative defenses that a defendant must raise.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Somerset County (Maryland) dismissed an inmate's motions to reopen postconviction proceedings; to correct an illegal sentence; for a new resentencing hearing or, alternatively, to file a belated appeal; and for a new trial. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to the inmate's various claims, the court of appeals held, inter alia, that the inmate did not have a right to counsel during his collateral motions and thus, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the inmate to discharge his attorneys of his own volition. Next, the court of appeals concluded that the inmate's failure to raise a claim of racial discrimination with respect to peremptory strikes in any number of prior proceedings constituted a knowing, intelligent waiver of the issue. Since Crawford was a procedural rule and needed not be applied retroactively, the inmate's challenge to the admission of certain evidence failed. The inmate was not entitled to resentencing or a belated appeal to litigate the admissibility of a latter he wrote, as he made no mention of the challenged letter in his direct appeal and the postconviction court summarily denied his claim relating to that exhibit. The inmate's failure to object to a challenged jury instruction in a timely fashion, combined with his failure to even address the waiver argument before the court of appeals, persuaded the court of appeals to affirm the dismissal of his motion on that question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deputies forcibly entered the party's home to execute an arrest warrant for a non-resident. The court of appeals held the public duty doctrine did not bar the State's liability because the party alleged harm the officers' acts, not an external force. No expert testimony was required because jury instructions explained the standard established by the Fourth Amendment, so the jury could use its common knowledge to find if a breach occurred. Legally sufficient evidence showed a breach because (1) the governing standard barred entering the home of a third party not named in the arrest warrant, absent consent or exigent circumstances, which were not present, and (2) the deputies' testimony let a jury find they were trained that an arrest warrant let them enter a third party's home listed on an arrest warrant based only on a belief that the arrestee was there, contrary to controlling Fourth Amendment interpretation. The party showed the State's breach proximately caused her injury because the deputies' negligent training was, more likely than not, a substantial factor in producing an altercation leading to her injuries, since it was a foreseeable result of the improper training.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant union sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) of an order of appellee Public Service Commission (PSC) approving, under Md. Code Ann., Pub. Util. Cos. &sect; 4-301 (2008), a settlement adopting an alternative form of regulation (AFOR) for appellee telephone company (company). The trial court affirmed the order, and the union sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union said the PSC did not meet Md. Code Ann., Pub. Util. Cos. &sect; 4-301(b)(1)(ii)'s (2008) goal to ensure service quality because the PSC said the AFOR did not assure such quality. The court of appeals held the PSC's decision was not affected by an error of law because (1) it found the AFOR consistent with the public interest and the statutory standard for AFORs, (2) an AFOR could be goal oriented, so the PSC could set goals without dictating how the company met them, and (3) it was not intended that the PSC be absolutely certain an AFOR would reach its goals. Substantial evidence supported the PSC's order because (1) PSC staff said it was in the public interest and met Md. Code Ann., Pub. Util. Cos. &sect; 4-301 (2008), (2) the company's statistics supported it, and (3) the company's expert showed it met objections to a prior proposal. A claim that the PSC misrepresented the union's position was irrelevant because the union's consent was not required. It was no error, under Md. Code Ann., Pub. Util. Cos. &sect; 4-301 (2008), to balance the company's interests with those of customers and the state because requiring it to deliver its service at fair price necessitated such balancing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the court of appeals was whether a police officer's testimony that the driver had been driving a vehicle involved in a collision, based on the officer's post-crash investigation that included witness statements that the detained suspect had been traveling at a high rate of speed and had struck the car, was sufficient to establish reasonable grounds to request an alcohol content test under Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 16-205.1(b)(2) (1977, 2009 Repl. Vol.). The court of appeals held that, pursuant to &sect; 16-205.1(b)(2), the ALJ's determination that the police officer had reasonable grounds to detain the driver was supported by substantial evidence and was not premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law. The officer testified that the driver's truck had been involved in a collision, that the driver was present at the scene of the accident, and the driver admitted to traveling between to points after drinking two beers. Thus, it was reasonable to infer that the driver had been driving his truck, which was involved in an accident.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals of Maryland found no merit in petitioners' arguments. Among other things, the court of appeals held that the Legislature's decision to accomplish its objective by amending the Maryland Constitution, rather than enact legislation, did not violate any constitutional provision governing its authority to amend the constitution. In addition, the General Assembly did not refer the amendment proposed to votes, but rather placed the matter on the ballot for voter ratification. The Court of Appeals also concluded that the ballot language and prior notice given were sufficient. Voters were provided with reasonable notice of, and access to, the full language of the legislation, and the question posed accurately and unambiguously apprised voters of the true nature of the legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents premium finance companies (PFCs) sought judicial review of petitioner Maryland Insurance Commissioner's (Commissioner) cease-and-desist order to the PFCs to bar charging interest on loans to pay insurance premiums in excess of the maximum in Md. Code Ann., Ins. &sect; 23-304 (2011). The trial court remanded the matter for a new hearing, and the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower courts held it was error to delegate the administrative hearing to an associate deputy insurance commissioner (ADIC). The court of appeals disagreed because a &quot;command influence&quot; theory did not apply, and the delegation was proper, as (1) the hearing was not identical to the process leading to the cease-and-desist order (order), (2) the ADIC only decided questions of law, so judicial review would cure any error, (3) nothing showed the ADIC was arbitrary or capricious, (4) Md. Code Ann., Ins. &sect; 2-210(d) (2011) let the Commissioner delegate the hearing to the ADIC, and (5) nothing showed the ADIC participated in the order or that the Commissioner influenced the ADIC. The order was properly issued without rulemaking because it applied existing law. The Commissioner had authority to issue the order because his authority to compel compliance with Md. Code Ann., Ins. &sect; 23-304 was implied from the regulatory scheme. The order met procedural requirements because any noncompliance did not impair the PFCs' substantial rights. The order correctly interpreted Md. Code Ann., Ins. &sect; 23-304 (2011) because it required a finance charge computation meeting plain statutory requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor argued that the complaints against her were made in retaliation for her legitimate reporting of substandard medical care and efforts to improve the hospital, but the doctor offered no evidence of retaliatory motive. The court of appeals concluded that the decision declining to renew the doctor's privileges was supported by the evidence. The hospital investigated the doctor's conduct for over two years, holding at least 12 hearings, and the investigation garnered enough evidence to support a reasonable belief that the doctor disrupted hospital caregivers with her unprofessional conduct. Moreover, the doctor provided no evidence that the board did not act in the reasonable belief that the action was in the furtherance of quality health care. Although the doctor alleged retaliation generally, she did not connect it to the board's decision to terminate her privileges. Thus, the doctor failed to produce evidence sufficient to convince a rational trier of fact that the hospital failed to satisfy the standards for immunity in the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 11101-11152.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner real estate broker sought judicial review of the decision of respondent Maryland Real Estate Commission (Commission) to revoke his real estate licenses, under Md. Code Ann., Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof. &sect; 17-322(b)(24)(i) (2004), based on his child abuse convictions. The trial court affirmed the decision, as did the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland), and the broker sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The broker said no substantial evidence showed his convictions' nexus to his position as a broker, under Md. Code Ann., Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof. &sect; 17-322(d)(2) (2004), because nothing showed how a lock box system relied on to find his access to unsupervised children worked. The court of appeals held the Commission understood the system because five of its members were real estate professionals. It was no error to find a nexus between his convictions and professional activities because the Commission relied on substantial evidence. Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 1-209 (2009 Supp.), requiring a &quot;direct relationship&quot; between criminal convictions and a revoked occupational license, did not bar revocation because (1) it was not in effect when the licenses were revoked, and a presumption against retroactivity was not rebutted, and (2) it only applied to nonviolent crimes, and the broker's crimes were crimes of violence. Revocation was not arbitrary and capricious because (1) Md. Code Ann., Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof. &sect; 17-322(b)(24)(i) (2004) allowed it, and (2) the broker sexually abused minors for 15 years, showing a lack of responsibility, maturity, and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner ground lease owner sued respondent State Department of Assessments and Taxation (SDAT) in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) to declare Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 8-701 et seq. (2010) made ground lease owners register their leases, absent which their interests were extinguished and transferred to tenants. The court of appeals held extinguishment and transfer provisions, in Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 8-708 (2010), violated Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24 because they retrospectively abrogated vested rights, as they (1) retroactively impacted owners' reasonable reliance and settled expectations, since SDAT had to reach back in time to divest the owners' reversionary interests, and (2) removed all remedies and extinguished the interests completely. They violated Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 40 because they took owners' private property without just compensation by transferring the owners' property to tenants without compensation. Registration requirements in Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 8-704 (2010) were not an unconstitutional regulatory taking because (1) the minimal registration fee, under Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 8-704(c) (2010), did not interfere unreasonably with the owner's investment-backed expectations, and (2) they appropriately used the state's police power to regulate private property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tenants filed an action against defendants, the property owners and others, alleging claims for negligence and deceptive practices in violation of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act, Md. Code Ann., Com. Law tit. 13 (2005). The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. The Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) reversed. The tenants' petition and defendants' cross-petition for a writ of certiorari were granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principal issue before the court concerned the Reduction of Lead Risk in Housing Act, Md. Code Ann., Envir. &sect;&sect; 6-801 through 6-852 (2011 Supp.), which grants the owners of certain rental properties, under specified conditions, immunity from personal injury suits based upon a child's or pregnant woman's ingestion of lead. Among other things, the Act required the owners to register the properties and renew such registrations by the end of each calendar year. The parties stipulated that, in the instant case, the renewals were mailed by defendants on or before December 31 of each year but were not received until January of each of the following years. On appeal, the tenants argued that the Act's immunity provisions violated Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 19. The court of appeals held that the immunity provisions of the Act were invalid under Article 19. The substituted remedy under the Act for a permanently brain damaged child, being a maximum of $ 17,000, was totally inadequate and unreasonable. The appellate court also concluded that although the immunity provisions of the Act were invalid, they were severable from those remaining portions of the Act, which could be given effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the court of appeals was whether, incident to defendant's arrest, the police searched the locked glove compartment in objectively reasonable reliance on then-binding Maryland appellate precedent. The court of appeals held that the search was not a valid inventory search. Even assuming that the officer's references to a &quot;procedure&quot; sufficed to establish the existence of a sufficiently routinized, general department inventory, the officer's testimony gave no indication that the supposed policy provided standardized criteria governing the search of closed or locked containers and, if so, that the search in this case was done according to that policy. The court of appeals further held that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied to what, at the time, was a lawful search of the glove compartment, under Belton. The officer acted in objectively reasonable reliance on that authority when he searched the locked glove compartment; thus, the good-faith rule of Davis applied and the suppression court correctly denied defendant's motion to suppress the handgun found there.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners taxpayers sought judicial review of a Tax Court decision upholding respondent Comptroller of the Treasury's (Comptroller) assessment for unpaid Special Nonresident Taxes (SNRT).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals held the SNRT facially discriminated because it did not apply to residents. It met the compensatory tax doctrine because it (1) compensated for services to nonresidents, (2) did not exceed an intrastate burden it compensated for, and (3) taxed income, like county income taxes, and equally taxed Maryland income earners. It did not offend equal protection, under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because it (1) did not tax nonresidents more than residents, and (2) rationally distinguished between the two. It did not offend the privileges and immunities clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2, cl. 1, because it (1) did not tax nonresidents more than residents' county income taxes, (2) compensated for local services, (3) was tied to nonresidents' Maryland relationship, and (4) did not cause a &quot;tax war.&quot; It did not violate Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24 because it was related to equalizing nonresidents' and residents' taxes. The Tax Court could abate interest, under Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 13-606 (2004), because (1) Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 13-510(a)(1) (2004) allowed appeals of such assessments to it, and (3) Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 13-528 (2004) let it modify the assessments.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed because Md. Const. art. IV, &sect; 3 unambiguously and when read in context with the rest of Md. Const. art. IV barred retaining, appointing, or electing a person over 70 as a Maryland circuit judge, as (1) it did not only prescribe a retirement age for sitting judges but referred to an entire category of judges, including all who were, or would seek to become, members of the category, and (2) the eligibility requirements for circuit judges in Md. Const. art. IV, &sect; 5 implied a judicial candidate's age was a qualification for office. If Md. Const. art. IV, &sect; 3, in the context of Md. Const. art. IV, were ambiguous, the judge's construction conflicted with the intent of the Maryland Constitution's framers because (1) that intent was to exclude persons over 70 from judicial office, and (2) the legislature did not change the longstanding practice of not letting judges remain regular members of the bench after age 70.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After responding to a domestic altercation, police seized defendant's weapons and transported him to a hospital for a mental health evaluation. Upon his release, he requested return of his weapons, which a judge denied. On an application to purchase a new firearm, defendant certified, under penalty of perjury, that he had not been committed to a mental institution. The issue before the court of appeals was whether defendant's conviction for perjury and false information in a firearm application could be founded upon his failure to disclose a court order that was later reversed. The court of appeals first noted that the application question asking if defendant had been adjudicated a mental defective or committed to a mental institution was not ambiguous. The court of appeals also concluded that defendant was obligated to answer &quot;yes,&quot; despite his ongoing dispute with the order denying his request for a return of his firearms for having been committed to a mental institution. Evidence of defendant's intent to provide false information was shown by the fact that he conferred with counsel and the fun shop on the issue of whether the denial order prevented him for purchasing a firearm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent personal representative sued petitioner physician for medical malpractice. The trial court granted the physician's summary judgment motion, finding the personal representative's certificate of merit (certificate) did not meet Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 3-2A-02 (2010 Supp.). The Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) reversed, holding dismissal without prejudice was the proper remedy. The physician sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The personal representative's certificate's author was unqualified, under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 3-2A-02 (2010 Supp.). The court of appeals held the proper remedy was dismissal without prejudice, rather than summary judgment, because (1) Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 3-2A-02 (2010 Supp.) was read together with Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 3-2A-04 (2010 Supp.), providing for dismissal without prejudice when a certificate of merit did not meet that statute's requirements, (2) the legislature added the qualifications in Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 3-2A-02 (2010 Supp.) knowing Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 3-2A-04 (2010 Supp.) required dismissal without prejudice for lack of a proper certificate, and (3) the words &quot;in addition to any other qualifications&quot; in Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 3-2A-02(c)(2)(ii) (2010 Supp.) showed a legislative intent to read the two statutes' qualifications together. Dismissal without prejudice supported the legislative purpose because it required a qualified expert while giving a plaintiff a chance to re-file if a qualified expert attested to departures from the standard of care and causation.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals found the issue unpreserved, as neither of his motions for judgment of acquittal were made on the basis argued on appeal. Both parties attacked the court of special appeals' decision regarding defendant's proposed jury instruction. Defendant submitted that the court of special appeals erred by condoning the trial court's failure to instruct the jury as to the long recognized privilege to resist an unlawful arrest, while the State protested the holding that the issue of an unlawful arrest was factually generated. The court of appeals agreed with the court of special appeals that the issue of an unlawful arrest was generated. The court of appeals further concluded that the court of special appeals erred in determining that an instruction on resisting arrest was not necessary. Because the evidence presented at trial generated the issue of whether the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant, the only way for defendant to have a fair trial was for the jury to understand the law concerning his right to resist and unlawful arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court denied defendant's request for a pre-trial hearing on whether the State could meet its burden under Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said the collateral order doctrine let him immediately appeal the trial court's order. The court of appeals disagreed because the order (1) was not completely separate from the merits of the underlying case, as the evidence the State would have to produce at the hearing defendant sought was intimately tied to whether he was guilty of a charged murder and whether, if convicted, he was subject to the death sentence, and (2) was not effectively unreviewable if appellate review were delayed until after a final judgment, as his right to insist upon the State's compliance with the statute by producing statutorily required evidence was not hindered by awaiting final judgment for appellate review, and, if successful, any death sentence imposed would be vacated, so the justification for an immediate appeal was not strong enough to overcome the usual benefits of deferring an appeal until the case ended.</SPAN></P>

The issue was whether suspension of the driver's license hinged on proof by the MVA at the show cause hearing that the driver was stopped on a highway or private property used by the public.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was stopped by a police officer for failing to obey lane directions. The officer detected an odor of alcohol on the driver's breath,. The driver failed to complete sobriety tests or submit to a chemical breath test, as authorized by Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 16-205.1(b)(2). The driver was informed of the resulting administrative sanctions if he refused. A Form DR-15A was submitted which included a pre-printed certification containing a statement that the stop occurred on a highway or private property that was used by the public in general. The ALJ found that the officer had reasonable grounds to detain the driver and suspended his license for 120 days. The trial court reversed the decision of the ALJ. The appellate court held that &sect; 16-205.1 did not preclude suspension if a motorist was detained somewhere other than on a highway or private property used by the public in general. The Statute did not require the MVA to prove at the show cause administrative hearing that the officer stopped the driver on a highway or private property used by the public in general.

The high court held that the citizens had standing to seek judicial review, petitioners' claim to the contrary notwithstanding, as they were taxpayers of the county and at least one of them participated at each administrative hearing. The citizens exhausted their administrative remedies by appearing and testifying at the agency hearings. Once the council elected to review the decisions, the citizens were not required to file an independent request for review. The council could not summarily withdraw its election to review and finalize the local agency decisions without following the statutory procedure for review set out in the Prince George's County, Md., Code.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent granddaughter filed a complaint against petitioner grandfather alleging claims for, inter alia, battery, false imprisonment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Five years after attaining the age of majority, the granddaughter filed a complaint against the grandfather alleging that the grandfather raped the granddaughter on two separate occasions, once when she was six or seven years of age and a second time when she was eight years of age. At the time the granddaughter reached the age of majority the limitations period for the alleged acts was three years. The applicable statute was amended prior to the end of the three-year period to allow for such actions to be brought within seven years of the date the victim, the granddaughter, attained the age of majority. The issue before the court of appeals was whether Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 5-117 (2006), expressly to extend from three years to seven years the statute of limitations for civil  claims stemming from alleged child sexual abuse, applied retroactively. The court of appeals held that &sect; 5-117 was a procedural or remedial statute, and accordingly, it could be given retrospective application to claims that were not yet barred by the previously applicable three-year limitations period as of the extended period's effective date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner residents sued a county, challenging an amendment to the county's local critical area plan under the regulatory scheme of the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area Protection Program, Md. Code Ann., Nat. Res. &sect; 8-1801 et seq. (2007 Repl. Vol.). The trial court affirmed the county's action. Petitioners appealed; the Maryland Court of Special Appeals dismissed the appeal. Petitioners sought a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To implement the county's approval of a developer's growth allocation application, the county decided to amend its local Critical Area Plan. The county proclaimed that its decision was not effective until approved by the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Commission. Apparently while consideration of the county's local growth allocation approval was pending before the Commission, petitioners filed their appeal. The trial court affirmed the action of the county; the intermediate appellate court dismissed petitioners' subsequent appeal as premature. The high court held that as the county's growth allocation policy stated that no local approval action was effective until approved by the Commission, and as the Commission, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Nat. Res. &sect; 8-1809, might ultimately override the county's decision to approve the growth allocation request, the county's approval of that request was not a final and appealable action. Therefore, the intermediate appellate court properly dismissed petitioners' appeal, but should have also vacated the trial court's judgment on the merits affirming the county's approval of the request.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the intermediate appellate court was vacated. The case was remanded to that court with directions to dismiss the appeal, vacate the judgment of the trial court, and remand the case to the trial court with directions that it dismiss the petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff accused sued defendants, a county police department, the county, and individual officers for various state tort and constitutional claims, based on his detention after police had evidence excluding him as a perpetrator. A jury awarded the accused damages of $ 6.2 million, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 5-303(b)(1) (2006), and the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) affirmed. Defendants sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants said the accused gave untimely notice of his claims, under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 5-304 (2006). The court of appeals disagreed because, (1) as to his false arrest and imprisonment claims, sound policy began the notice period when he was released after being held for trial but not tried, and (2) this resolved the issue for the other claims, as they shared an accrual date for limitations purposes with false arrest and imprisonment or did not accrue until his release. The damages cap in Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 5-303(a)(1) (2006) did not limit the accused's award because retroactively applying a statute to limit the award deprived him of a vested right, contrary to Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24 and Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 40. The accused properly recovered under a claim that the county had a &quot;pattern or practice&quot; of unconstitutional police policies because (1) Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24 protected individuals against municipalities' unconstitutional &quot;patterns or practices,&quot; and (2) the accused proved the unconstitutional actions committed against him and that this was not an isolated incident.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner driver sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Charles County (Maryland) of decisions of respondent Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) denying (1) the driver a hearing on whether he was precluded from licensure in Maryland and (2) his request for expungement of his driving record. The trial court held he was entitled to a hearing but that he was not entitled to expungement. Both the driver and the MVA sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After granting the driver a &quot;Maryland only&quot; license, due to prior drunk driving convictions in Maryland and Florida, the MVA summarily denied his request to renew the license, and he sought expungement of his driving record. The court of appeals held he was properly denied expungement because, reading Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect;&sect; 16-117.1 and 12-111 (2009) together, once the MVA exercised its discretion in Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 12-111 (2009) to classify his convictions as &quot;confidential,&quot; the records of the convictions were not subject to expungement under Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 16-117.1 (2009). It was error to order the MVA to provide the driver a hearing to determine if he should be issued a license, even though he had mistakenly been issued a &quot;Maryland only&quot; license, because he was barred, as a matter of law, under Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 16-103.1(1) (2009), from obtaining a Maryland license, as (1) the statute barred the MVA from issuing a license to anyone whose license was revoked in any state, (2) his license was permanently revoked in Florida, due to his drunk driving convictions, and (3) no statutory provision required that he be provided with a hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment directing a remand for an administrative hearing was reversed, and the judgment was otherwise affirmed. The matter was remanded to the trial court with directions to enter an order affirming the summary denial of the driver's application to renew his license.</SPAN></P>

The driver said his right to consult counsel before deciding to submit to the test was violated when he was not given privacy to consult counsel. The court of appeals held due process was satisfied when the driver was advised of possible administrative sanctions by having a chance to read a form advising him of his rights. It was unnecessary to decide if a right to consult counsel before deciding whether to submit to the test applied in the administrative context because the driver had a chance to contact counsel, and no right of privacy applied to his unsuccessful attempt to contact counsel. Substantial evidence supported the ALJ's finding that the driver refused to submit to the test because the ALJ could find the officer's certification that the driver refused the test more credible than the driver's testimony that the officer did not ask him to choose whether to take the test after he unsuccessfully tried to consult counsel.</SPAN></P>

In an action under the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, a circuit court reversed the Board's decision and the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board received a complaint against the doctor, a licensed psychiatrist, that he was overmedicating four patients.

Although privacy rights were initially invoked, the records were forwarded on March 20, 2002. The doctor was absolved of the overmedication allegation. Nevertheless, the Board found the doctor failed to cooperate with the investigation. The Board's decision to reprimand the doctor and impose a fine was legally correct because neither the doctor nor the patients took any appropriate action to challenge the subpoena as required by Md. Code Ann., Health-Gen. &sect;&sect; 4-306 and 4-307. As such, the doctor failed to comply with the subpoena in a timely manner and did not cooperate in the investigation. The Board did not have the burden of instituting a judicial action to enforce the subpoena. If the patients and/or the doctor believed there were grounds for not producing the records, the patients or the doctor had to file a motion to quash the subpoena or a motion for a protective order pursuant to Md. R. 2-403 or 2-510.</SPAN></P>

He was properly convicted because (1) sufficient evidence showed he wore, carried, or transported a handgun in public, (2) he conceded he did not seek a permit, (3) the Second Amendment barred statutory prohibitions against home possession of firearms, and (4) Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law &sect; 4-203(b)(6) (2002), allowing home possession, took Md. Code Ann., Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners principals sought review of respondent Maryland Consumer Protection Division's (Division) order finding they violated Maryland's (1) Home Builder Registration Act, Md. Code Ann., Bus. Reg. &sect;&sect; 4.5-101 to 4.5-701 (2007 Supp.), and (2) Consumer Protection Act (CPA), Md. Code Ann., Com. Law &sect;&sect; 13-101 to 13-501 (2009 Supp.). The trial court and Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) affirmed, and the principals sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principals sought to add their defunct limited liability company as a petitioner after the Court of Special Appeals dismissed it. The Court of Appeals held they did not preserve the issue, under Md. R. 8-131(b)(1), by raising it in their petition for certiorari or in a subsequent motion. Their company did not have to register as a home builder, under Md. Code Ann., Bus. Reg. &sect;&sect; 4.5-101 to 4.5-701 (Supp. 2007), because, while its contracts agreed to &quot;sell and construct,&quot; as well as &quot;complete,&quot; new homes, it was clear that the contracts in their entirety specified that actual construction would be done by a registered home builder, so competent, material, and substantial evidence did not support the Division's presumption that the company held itself out as a home builder. The company and the principals violated Md. Code Ann., Com. Law &sect; 13-301(13) (Supp. 2009), by requiring buyers to release the company and principals from consequential damages in exchange for a limited warranty, because, while the releases said nothing about consequential damages, their language was sufficiently expansive to fall within the CPA's clear and unambiguous regulatory prohibition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the Court of Special Appeals finding a violation of the Home Builder Registration Act was reversed, but the judgment finding a CPA violation was affirmed. The matter was remanded to the Court of Special Appeals with directions to reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the case to that court for further remand to the Division for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A department of social services (DSS) filed a petition for guardianship of petitioner child, seeking termination of respondent parent's parental rights. The trial court denied the petition, finding DSS did not show, by clear and convincing evidence, that the parent was unfit or that exceptional circumstances justified termination. The Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) affirmed, and the child sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found a prior Court of Appeals decision changed the law. The court of appeals held this was error because best interest of the child still governed. The trial court's judgment had to be vacated because, after finding no exceptional circumstances justified termination, it gave little, in any, weight to factors in Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 5-323(d)(4) (Supp. 2009) addressing termination from the point of view of the child's circumstances, focusing on the parent's circumstances, as it did not address the child's emotional ties to the parent, under Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 5-323(d)(4)(i) (Supp. 2009), or the child's feelings about termination, under Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 5-323(d)(4)(iii) (Supp. 2009), and, as to the impact of termination on the child, under Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 5-323(d)(4)(iv) (Supp. 2009), it found the prior decision almost asked the court to ignore that. The court incorrectly found, in noting that another child had been returned to the parent, that a finding of exceptional circumstances was not unique to a particular child because this did not take into account circumstances particular to an individual child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent surviving spouse filed a petition for judicial review of Maryland Workers' Compensation Commission's determination that he was ineligible to claim benefits under Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Special Appeals agreed with the spouse that his deceased wife, who had a claim for workers' compensation benefits, had &quot;a legal obligation to support&quot; him during their marriage On appeal, the employer challenged that court's interpretation of Md. Code Ann., Lab. &amp; Empl. &sect; 9-632. The spouse contended that a &quot;legal obligation to support&quot; a surviving spouse was inherent in the marital relationship and continued until given up, either voluntarily or by court order. The court of appeals held that, for purposes of &sect; 9-632(d), &quot;a legal obligation to support&quot; a surviving spouse did not arise by virtue of the marital tie alone, but arose from a legally enforceable contract, decree, or order from a court of competent jurisdiction. The court of appeals found that at the time of the wife's death, the spouse, under Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 10-201 (2006), had no legally enforceable rights and the wife had not corresponding legally enforceable duties. Because the spouse failed to introduce any evidence of the existence of a legal duty to support him on the part of his wife, the wife's right to receive compensation benefits did not pass to the spouse under &sect; 9-632(d).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals issued writs of certiorari and directed defendants to file briefs on the issue of whether it had jurisdiction to decide two cases in light of Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the writs of certiorari should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, because Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 12-202 (2006) was an extremely broad limitation upon the court of appeals' certiorari jurisdiction, covering every case where appellate court of the intermediate appellate court was by application for leave to appeal, and, alternatively, because &sect; 12-202 deprived the court of appeals of jurisdiction where the intermediate appellate court simply denied or granted the application for leave to appeal without resolving or deciding any of the legal or factual merits of the application. The court of appeals rejected the broad limitation argument advanced by the State, noting that it adhered to a long line of cases which essentially supported the State's alternative argument, under which the jurisdictional limitation is narrow.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a survival and wrongful death case, petitioner pool company's motion for summary judgment on the issue of pain and suffering was granted. A $ 4,006,442 jury award was reduced under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 11-108 (2008). The trial court denied the parents' motion to alter or amend judgment. The Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) reversed the grant of summary judgment and denial of motion to alter or amend. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first issue before the court of appeals was whether a jury could consider a claim for conscious pain and suffering when there was a reasonable inference of consciousness prior to the decedent's death, but the length of that consciousness and evidence of pain and suffering during the drowning process were based on expert testimony rather than on eyewitness testimony. The court of appeals agreed with the parents' argument that once a reasonable inference arose from expert testimony, the jury should decide whether the decedent experienced conscious pain and suffering. While no eyewitnesses saw the decedent drown, the evidence showed that he likely was conscious when entering the water. In addition, expert testimony was presented that, to a medical degree of certainty, the decedent consciously experienced pain and suffering. Thus, the issue should have been presented to the jury. Next, the court of appeals upheld the denial of the parents' motion to alter or amend judgment, finding that the cap in Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 11-108 (2008) had been previously upheld as constitutional and affirming that holding under the principle of stare decisis.</SPAN></P>

Const. Decl. Rights art. 24, (2) violated housing anti-discrimination laws, (3) was impermissible zoning, and (4) was confiscatory.

Rights art. 24, because (1) its goals were not illegitimate governmental ends, and (2) a perceived nexus between it and the goals of encouraging housing availability for households of all incomes and preserving, maintaining, and improving existing housing had a rational basis. It did not offend housing anti-discrimination provisions in Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 20-705 (2009) or Prince George's County (Md.) Code &sect; 2-210(a) (Supp. 2005) because it distinguished between rental units in single-family neighborhoods and those in apartment buildings, so it did not distinguish between groups based on a group characteristic. It was not de facto zoning, unauthorized under Md. Ann. Code art. 28, &sect; 7-103(b), because it did not divide the city into districts, define lot sizes, or mandate uses. It was not impermissibly confiscatory because (1) it gave a landlord a way to obtain a fair return on an investment, and (2) nothing showed it unreasonably limited return rates.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Chair of the Maryland Critical Area Commission for the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays filed a complaint against defendant landowner for restoration and mitigation pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Nat. Res. &sect; 8-1815(a)(2)(i)(1). Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland) granted the motion to dismiss, with prejudice. The chair appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subject property was an island in a limited development area and lying within either the buffer or expanded buffer of the critical area. The landowner demolished the existing development and built a new home, sheds, gazebo, boat ramp, driveway, sidewalks, pool, and deck, without the necessary permits and variances. The issue before the court of appeals was whether amended Md. Code Ann., Nat. Res. &sect; 8-1808(c)(4) (Supp. 2009) applied to the variance application filed three and one half years before the statute was amended and where the object of the application was to cure violations of the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area Protection Program (Critical Area Law), Md. Code Ann., Nat. Res. &sect;&sect; 8-1801 to 8-1817 (Supp. 2009). The court of appeals concluded that the amended provision did not apply retrospectively to the variance application. The Legislature intended for the amendments to be applied prospectively to situations where an underlying violation of the Critical Area Law pre-deated the amendment. The Legislature included an effective date and also expressed that the Act was not have not effect on the Critical Area Law violations originating before that date.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 16-205.1 (2009), an administrative law judge (ALJ) suspended respondent motorist's license for 90 days; it stayed the suspension for one year, conditioned on his participation in the ignition interlock program. Respondent appealed; the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland, reversed. The Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration's petition for review was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After stopping respondent for not wearing a seatbelt, the officer smelled a moderate odor of alcohol emanating from him. The officer conducted field sobriety tests (FSTs) and arrested him. Respondent took a breath test, which disclosed a blood alcohol concentration of 0.18. He challenged the test results and argued that under the implied consent law, the officer lacked grounds to request him to take the breath test. The trial court reversed the suspension, ruling that because the officer lacked a reasonable articulable suspicion that respondent was under the influence of alcohol, conducting the FSTs violated the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, and all actions taken thereafter were legally unsupportable. The high court disagreed. Neither the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine nor the exclusionary rule applied to license suspension proceedings. Further, the trial court erred by employing a rationale for reversing the ALJ's decision that was not advanced by respondent and was not the basis of the ALJ's decision. Substantial evidence supported the ALJ's decision that the officer had reasonable grounds under &sect; 16-205.1(b)(2) to request respondent to take a breath test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was vacated and the case was remanded to that court with instructions to decide whether the ALJ improperly relied upon the results of the breathalyzer test in ordering the sanction of license suspension.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner fortuneteller sued a county and its executive, seeking a declaratory judgment, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 3-406, stating that the fortunetelling ordinance, Montgomery County, Md., Code &sect; 32-7 (1999), violated the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, and Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 40. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) granted summary judgment for the county. The fortuneteller appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fortuneteller wanted to open a fortuentelling business in the county. However, a county ordinance prohibited the acceptance of remuneration for fortunetelling. The fortuneteller claimed that the ordinance violated his right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, and Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 40. The court of appeals agreed, noting that a restriction on remuneration for protected speech is a restriction on the speaker's First Amendment right to freedom of speech. By punishing speech when that speech was made in exchange for payment, the fortunetelling ordinance imposed a burden on that speech. The court of appeals declined to find, as the county suggested, that fortunetelling was inherently fraudulent and thus, should not receive First Amendment protection. The court of appeals also declined to find that fortunetelling was commercial speech merely because the fortuneteller might receive money in exchange for his services. Finally, the court of appeals concluded that the ordinance was not narrow tailored, as there was at least one less restrictive, effective means of combating fraud - laws making fraud illegal without respect to protected speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In three cases, respondent/petitioners employees sued petitioner/respondent employer in the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland) for employment discrimination, under former Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, &sect; 42(a) (2003). In one case, the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) affirmed a ruling that the employer was a person, and it appealed. In the other cases, the Court of Appeals issued writs of certiorari, sua sponte, to review the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer, the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC), said it was not a &quot;person,&quot; under former Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, &sect; 42(a) (2003), now Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 20-1202(a) (2009), so it could not be sued for employment discrimination under a county ordinance. The court of appeals disagreed because (1) Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, &sect; 15's definitions applied to Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, &sect; 42(a), as they were in pari materia, (2) the definition of &quot;person&quot; excluded the state but included local entities, and, (3) to further statutory purposes of eliminating employment discrimination and letting certain counties have their county codes' anti-discrimination provisions enforced in private civil actions, and to construe &sect; 42(a) broadly for claimants, &quot;person,&quot; as used in &sect; 42(a), included WSSC as a local entity, due to its autonomy from state oversight and nearly exclusive level of control over employment decisions. The county ordinance was not an unconstitutional general law due to taxes imposed on another county's citizens to satisfy a judgment against WSSC under the ordinance because any extra-territorial effect was due to WSSC's decision about how to satisfy a judgment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended the police-created abandonment of a cup led to illegal and warrantless deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing. The court of appeals disagreed, finding that defendant unequivocally abandoned the cup after he was offered a meal, accepted it, and threw the debris on the floor. Defendant also argued that even if seizure of the cup was lawful, the testing of DNA on the cup was a separate search and it was unreasonable to conduct the test because defendant was being detained and had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his DNA. The court of appeals concluded that there was no Fourth Amendment violation, as defendant voluntarily abandoned the cup and thus, no unconstitutional seizure occurred. Next, the court of appeals concluded that the uploading of the DNA sample to a database and a query of that database did not violate defendant's rights. Finally, the court of appeals concluded that defendant's statement was admissible, as his arrest was based on probable cause and the statement was free of Fifth Amendment violations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the court of appeals was whether the trial court had the authority to appoint an attorney from a local OPD to represent a criminal defendant who qualified for public representation based on indigency, upon the court's finding that the local OPD previously and erroneously denied representation to the defendant. The court of appeals concluded that the trial court had such authority and did not exceed its authority when it appointed the attorney, the Deputy District Public Defender for Cecil County, or a member of his office, to represent the indigent defendant, to whom representation had been previously and wrongfully denied by the local OPD. By evaluating the defendant's application solely under the maximum net annual income and asset ceiling standard of Md. Code Regs. 14.06.03.05A and D(2), while ignoring wholly the statutorily-mandated indigency factors contained in former Md. Ann. Code art. 27A, &sect; 7 (2003), and Md.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner appealed two judgment of the Circuit Court for Harford County (Maryland), one which affirmed the Harford County Board of Appeals's denial of the owner's request for several variances and one which affirmed the Harford County Board of Appeals's interpretation of various zoning provisions applicable to the owner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner sought to construct and operate a rubble landfill on the property. On appeal, the owner challenged various decisions which led to the denial of the necessary variances. Among other things the court of appeals held that the Board did not err in finding that granting the requested variances would be substantially detrimental to the adjacent property. Evidence showed, inter alia, that the landfill activities would be substantially detrimental to the historic church and graveyard that were next to the subject property. In addition, the community would be detrimentally affected, as the increase in air pollution was likely to result in worsening of asthma in children, cardio-respiratory difficulties in elderly persons, and increased truck traffic in areas where children played and boarded school buses. As for the second case, the court of appeals concluded, inter alia, that the county's right to enact and enforce zoning regulations was not preempted by the State statute governing landfills. The court also noted that the owner needed more than a state permit and site plan approval to have a vested right in an existing zoning use and neither equitable nor zoning estoppel applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner shareholders appealed the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland), which affirmed a trial court judgment dismissing their claims against respondents, a board of directors and investors, principally because the suit was seen as an impermissible direct shareholder suit. Petitioners asserted that respondents breached their fiduciary duties owed to petitioners with regard to a cash-out merger transaction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On direct appeal, the Court of Special Appeals held that Md. Code Ann., Corp. &amp; Ass'ns &sect; 2-405.1 (1975, 2007 Repl. Vol.) barred all direct shareholder claims and affirmed the dismissal of petitioners' claims for civil conspiracy and aiding and abetting. The court held that the Court of Special Appeals erred in so holding and determined that, where corporate directors exercise non-managerial duties outside the scope of &sect; 2-405.1(a), such as negotiating the price that shareholders will receive for their shares in a cash-out merger transaction, after the decision to sell the corporation already has been made, they remain liable directly to shareholders for any breach of those fiduciary duties. The court held that &sect; 2-405.1(a) does not provide the sole source of directorial duties, and that other common law fiduciary duties of directors remain in place and may be triggered by the occurrence of appropriate events. As such, because the fiduciary duties of the board were owed directly to petitioners as shareholders, petitioners were permitted to proceed directly against the board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed, in part, that part of the Court of Special Appeals's judgment that dismissed petitioners' direct claims against the board  for the alleged breach of fiduciary duties of candor and maximization of shareholder value. The court affirmed, in part, the dismissal of petitioners' claims against the investors for civil conspiracy and aiding and abetting.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in an Adult Truancy Petition alleging a violation of Md. Code Ann., Educ. &sect; 7-301 based on her daughter's absence from school for 74 of 180 days. The Circuit Court of Prince George's County (Maryland), sitting as a juvenile court, placed defendant on unsupervised probation. Defendant appealed. Before the argument was presented, the state's highest court issued a writ of certiorari on its own initiative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court noted that defendant and the daughter both testified that although the daughter arrived at her school on a regular basis, she rarely attended classes. It was reasonably concluded that the child did not attend school for more than 10 weeks, and that defendant had failed to see that the daughter attended school. This presumption was rebutted as it was based upon the impermissible inference that because defendant's incomprehensible testimony lacked credibility, the opposite of her exculpatory testimony was true. Although defendant was not entitled to a judgment in her favor as a matter of law, she was entitled to a new trial. Once the daughter entered the school building, she was in the care and custody of the school. Because a child who attended school was committed to the control of state and local authorities, evidence that a high school student was not in his or her homeroom when attendance was taken was sufficient to establish that the student did not attend school on that day. However, there was a fact issue as to whether the child was cutting class. A finding that defendant violated the &sect; 7-301 required proof that the daughter did not attend school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was vacated, and the case was remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) sued a shooting sports club, seeking civil penalties and an injunction prohibiting the club from engaging in shooting activities on its property until it complied with noise regulations. The trial court granted the requested relief. The club appealed; the Maryland Court of Special Appeals affirmed. The club's petition for a writ of certiorari was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Md. Code Ann., Envir. &sect; 3-401(c)(6) (2007) exempted shooting sports clubs in certain counties, including the one where the club operated, from MDE noise regulations unless, as of 1 January 2005, they had been found to be non-compliant with an MDE noise regulation prohibiting sounds greater than 60 decibels to be heard on adjacent residential property during daylight hours. The club claimed that &sect; 3-401(c)(6)(ii) violated Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24 and the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV by distinguishing arbitrarily between shooting sports clubs in different counties and against clubs that were not compliant with MDE regulations as of 1 January 2005. The high court disagreed. Section 3-401(c)(6) was related rationally to a legitimate interest in promoting local preferences. That the club was allegedly the only one affected by &sect; 3-401(c)(6)(ii)'s exclusion of clubs deemed non-compliant as of 1 January 2005 did not violate equal protection, as the club did not explain how it was treated differently from similarly-situated clubs. The adoption of &sect; 3-401(c)(6)(ii) was not a new grant of authority that required MDE to promulgate new noise regulations.</SPAN></P>

The Carroll County Circuit Court (Maryland) granted the State's motion to dismiss the case and held that the challenged legislation was valid. Petitioners' request for a writ of certiorari was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature enacted a law proposing for voter ratification a constitutional amendment authorizing slot machines and placing restrictions on their use. Petitioners argued that the legislature violated the state Constitution by making an appropriations bill contingent on voter approval, as this was an unconstitutional attempt to delegate to the public its duties of enacting legislation. The high court disagreed. Md. Const. art. XVI gave explicit authority to the legislature to propose, and for the voters to approve, constitutional amendments. The legislature had the power to enact general legislation before, and contingent on, the adoption of a constitutional amendment that it had proposed to the voters. As the sufficiency of a ballot question that had yet to be drafted was a hypothetical inquiry, if the high court ruled on the question, it would be improperly issuing an advisory opinion; therefore, this issue was not justiciable. As to petitioners's claim that the extension of the legislature's adjournment violated Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 25, since this was an internal procedural issue for the legislature to resolve, it was a nonjusticiable political question.</SPAN></P>

The county's planning commission had approved the subdivision, which the board affirmed in a de novo appeal proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer owned 275 acres and obtained approval to construct a subdivision on that land.

The protestor asserted that the board engaged in a de novo review of the commission's decision and that in such a proceeding, the burden of proof remained with the applicant, the developer. The court agreed with the protestor and found that the Board erred in shifting the burden of proof from the developer, the subdivision applicant, to the protestor, the appellant in the board's de novo review proceeding. The court held that in a proceeding before the board, an entirely new hearing in which all specified issues on appeal should be heard anew as if no decision had been previously rendered, which required the burden to remain with the developer to establish facts necessary to obtain approval for its proposed subdivision. Additionally, the court held that the board or the commission had to apply the conformity and emergency service ordinances, which were enacted while the case was on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner child's economic damages for her exposure to lead-based paint were capped at $ 515,000 under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 11-801. The Maryland Court of Special Appeals (intermediate court) held that &sect; 11-801 applied to all actions for personal injury and wrongful death, that &sect; 11-801 was constitutional under Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 33, and that the cause of action arose after October 1, 1995, but before October 1, 1996.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child's petition for a writ of certiorari was granted. The child's Maryland Consumer Protection Act (CPA), Md. Code Ann., Com. Law &sect; &sect; 13-301 et seq., claim was a personal injury action, and &sect; 11-108 applied to proceedings in which a consumer asserted a claim for money damages to compensate for injuries sustained as a result of a CPA violation. The Maryland legislature, when it amended the cap statute, did not intend to expand the statute to cover wrongful death actions, but at the same time intend to narrow its application so it covered wrongful death actions and all actions for personal injury so long as the victims were injured as the result of common law torts. The trial court properly ruled that the cap statute applied to the child's claim for damages that arose, in part, out of a violation of the CPA. Section 11-108 applied to any action for damages for personal injury, and was a general law, not a special law under &sect; 33. On the basis of the testimony of the child's expert, the child was lead poisoned as of September 26, 1996, and the cause of action arose prior to October 1, 1996. Thus, the verdict was properly capped at $ 515,000.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition for a writ of certiorari was granted allowing petitioner to challenge the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland), which affirmed the judgment of conviction and the denial of his motion to suppress by the trial court. Petitioner was found guilty of second degree assault, resisting arrest, possession of marijuana, and disorderly conduct, following a jury trial and was sentenced to four years of incarceration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was observed by a police officer lying in the middle of the street. Petitioner got up and started to walk away. The officer told petitioner that he was going to take him to the hospital as he thought petitioner was under the influence of a controlled substance. The officer attempted to handcuff petitioner at which time a struggle ensued, which led to his seizure and the seizure of the contraband on his person. Petitioner asserted that his warrantless arrest was unreasonable since probable cause that he was engaged in criminal activity was lacking, therefore, anything that flowed from the unlawful arrest must be suppressed. The court adopted the community caretaking doctrine and a test to ensure that the community caretaking function is conducted reasonably. The court held that the officer's decision to place petitioner in handcuffs and to transport him to the hospital in his police cruiser was not carefully tailored to the underlying justification for the seizure. Petitioner had committed no crime and was not suspected of criminal activity. If medical treatment was necessary, an ambulance could have been called instead of the officer seizing petitioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court and remanded the case to that court with instructions for it to reverse the judgment of the trial court.

The applicant had brought suit against the Commission seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant had submitted its application for a video lottery operation license but did not include the multi-million dollar initial license fee. The Commission denied the application due to the absence of the fee. In response, the applicant filed the underlying action in the trial court. The trial court determined that jurisdiction of the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals did not apply to disputes that arose prior to the awarding of the video lottery operation license. The court disagreed and held that the special statutory remedy for an unsuccessful bidder for a video lottery operation license under Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 9-1A-36(o) (1984, 2004 Repl. Vol., 2008 Supp.) was for review by the State Board of Contract Appeals and that such remedy was exclusive. The court held that the trial court's declaratory judgment and decisions on the merits were inconsistent with the legislative intent embodied in the statutes governing video lottery terminals and was inconsistent with the principle that exclusive or primary administrative remedies must be exhausted before resort to the courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case to the trial court with directions for it to dismiss the action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was serving a prison sentence for convictions unrelated to this case when he killed another inmate. While still in prison, defendant wrote a letter to his father in which he admitted to killing someone in prison. Prison officials intercepted the letter and provided a copy to State prosecutors. Defendant sought to suppress the letter. Defendant argued that a prisoner's right to correspond was a fundamental right protected by the First Amendment and that he had a Fourth Amendment right to privacy in the letter. The appellate court held that defendant's constitutional rights were not violated when prison officials inspected the letter and provided a copy to State officials. Defendant did not have an expectation of privacy in his letter to his father that was objectively reasonable. Even if defendant had an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in his letter to his father, the seizure of the letter did not violate the Fourth Amendment because the seizure was justified by the prison's legitimate concern for security. The Inmate Orientation Manual did not support defendant's contention that he had an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in his mail.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mortgagors filed 19 suits, including 9 class action suits, alleging violations of the Maryland State Secondary Mortgage Loan Law (SMLL), Md. Code Ann., Com. Law &sect; 12-401 et seq., the Maryland State Consumer Protection Act (CPA), Md. Code Ann., Com. Law tit. 13, and seeking a declaratory judgment against defendants, the lenders, the holders of the loans, and certain non-holders who purchased other loans. The actions were dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Maryland Court of Special Appeals reversed as to the SMLL claims, and otherwise affirmed. Certiorari was granted. The state's highest court held that an action to recover civil penalties for SMLL violations was an other specialty under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 5-102(a)(6) and was subject to a 12-year limitations period. An action for damages under the CPA was subject to a three-year limitations period under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 5-101(3). The actions to declare the loans void or voidable due to SMLL violations were subject to a three-year limitations period under &sect; 5-101. Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 5-107 did not apply. The named plaintiffs in the class action suits based on SMLL violations could sue the lenders who made the loans and persons who purchased the loans from those lenders but had no cause of action against persons who purchased other loans from the lenders, but who had no interest in or connection with the named plaintiffs loans. Md. R. 2-231(a) did not permit such an action based on a judicial link between those persons and the other defendants or between them and other putative members of the plaintiff class.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the appellate court was affirmed as to non-holder defendants and as to claims under the CPA, but otherwise was reversed. The case was remanded to the appellate court with instructions to affirm in part and reversed in part the judgment of the trial court, and to remand to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion. The appellate costs were to be paid equally by the parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner resident challenged a judgment of the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland), which, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 12-302 (1974, 1998 Repl. Vol.), dismissed for lack of jurisdiction his appeal of the decision of a city board of port wardens to approve of respondent company's application to replace a pier and bulkhead. The court of appeals granted the resident's petition for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company submitted an application to the city for the replacement of the pier and bulkhead. The port wardens approved the application. The resident filed a petition for judicial review in the circuit court, which affirmed the port wardens' decision. The resident filed a notice of appeal to the court of special appeals. The court of special appeals found that it did not have jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a decision of the port wardens. The court of appeals held that the circuit court proceeding was a statutory judicial review action. The board of port wardens was not an agency under Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 10-202(b). Therefore, any right of appeal to the court of special appeals had to be found elsewhere, and no such right could be found in the Maryland Code, in the Anne Arundel County Code, or in the Annapolis City Code. Even if there were appellate jurisdiction, there was no merit in the resident's argument that the port wardens' decision was void ab initio. Because the resident had actual knowledge that the port wardens would consider the company's application at a public hearing, he lost nothing from the technical failures of notice about which he complained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner county appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland), which permitted respondent property owners to proceed with a class action to obtain a refund of development impact fees paid to the county within a certain time period. The property owners brought suit seeking recovery of the impact fees collected by the county for the fiscal years 1988 through 1996.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county was authorized to collect the impact fees via an ordinance. The trial court determined that because $ 4,719,359 in impact fees collected from the owners were not timely paid or encumbered for capital improvements, and the period to make capital improvements was not properly extended, the owners were entitled to refunds. The county argued that the trial court erred by not remanding the case to the county administrative officials for it to grant extensions and perform other tasks relative to the fees collected. The Court found that the trial court did not err in certifying the owners' class action under Md. R. 2-231(b). The Court found that although the county may face an onerous administrative burden in complying with the class member identification and individual notice requirements of a class action lawsuit due to its record-keeping practices, that burden did not render the class action unmanageable. The court further held that the trial court properly determined that the owners' action to recover the impact fees was not barred by the three-year statute of limitations set forth in Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 5-101 (1974, 2006 Repl. Vol., 2008 Supp.).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Maryland People's Insurance Counsel Division petitioned in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) for judicial review of an order of the Maryland Insurance Commissioner approving a filing submitted by respondent insurance company. The court granted the insurance company's motion for dismissal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance company notified the Maryland Insurance Commissioner, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Ins. &sect; 19-107 (2006), that it intended to stop accepting new homeowners insurance business in certain catastrophe prone areas in Maryland. When the Commissioner approved the filing, the Maryland People's Insurance Counsel Division petitioned for judicial review. The insurance company moved to dismiss the judicial review action, arguing that the Division did not have standing to seek judicial review under Md. Code Ann., Ins. &sect; 2-215 (2003), because it was not a party to the hearing before the Commissioner and because the Commissioner's approval of the filing was not an action from which judicial review could be sought. The state high court found that the general powers conferred upon the Division in Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 6-301 et seq. (2004, 2006 Supp.), gave the Division the ability to be a party to hearings before the Commissioner and to seek judicial review therefrom.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Maryland Court of Special Appeals on wrongful discharge and overtime wage claim summary judgment rulings reversed it for defendant State's Attorney but affirmed it as to defendant county on First Amendment claims, reversed it for the State's Attorney and defendant State on a corresponding state claim, entirely affirmed it as to abusive discharge, and reversed it for the county on the wage claims. The state's highest court granted certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's Attorney, newly-elected, fired the fired employees. The fired employees sued the State's Attorney, the State, and the county, alleging wrongful discharge because they had supported the State's Attorney's opponent in the general election, and the failure to pay overtime wages. They claimed violations of their free speech rights under the First Amendment, the corresponding state provision under Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 40, common law abusive discharge, and that the failure to pay overtime wages violated the Fair Labor Standards Act and Maryland Wage and Hour Law. The state's highest court found a triable issue existed as to the State's Attorney on the First Amendment, and as to the State's Attorney and State on the corresponding state claim, because the State's Attorney had the right to control office operations and political support being a job requirement. It also found that abusive discharge facts had to be further developed, and that triable factual issues about whether the county was the fired employees' joint employer and what the county knew about a pattern of overtime work precluded summary judgment on the state and federal overtime wage claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court on the First Amendment claim affirmed as to the State's Attorney, with the county not seeking review; it also affirmed as to the State's Attorney and State on the corresponding state claim, again with the county not seeking review, reversed as to the State's Attorney and State on the abusive discharge claim, with the county not seeking review, and affirmed as to the county on the state and federal overtime wage claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 450 limited the area of an identification sign to 25 square feet and the height of a sign to 6 feet. The church sought to construct a sign that would be 250 square feet in face area and 25 feet high. The church challenged the board's application of the requirements for a variance and argued that the denial of the variance violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000cc et seq. The court held that the board applied the correct legal standards in denying the variance request and that substantial evidence supported the board's findings that the physical attributes of the church's property were not unique and that the denial of the variance would not cause practical difficulty for the church. The court held that neither the board's decision nor the sign law violated the RLUIPA because the denial of the church's variance request did not impose a substantial burden on the church's religious exercise where the church had numerous ways of publicizing its activities and evangelizing, the church already had two identification signs, and there was no evidence that church attendance was falling due to the lack of the proposed sign.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a declaratory judgment action under Md. Code Ann., Elec. Law &sect; 6-209, plaintiff citizens challenged the validity of a referendum petition that had been certified for the ballot by defendant Montgomery County Board of Elections. The court granted cross-petitions for certiorari and expedited review from a decision of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland, to answer three questions presented by the citizens and the Board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the Board properly certified a referendum petition filed by the citizens that sought to overturn a bill enacted by the county council to add gender identity as a protected characteristic under the county's antidiscrimination laws. The circuit court dismissed the complaint as time-barred under Md. Code Ann., Elec. Law &sect; 6-210(e), finding that, even if suit had been timely filed, the citizens had no legal basis for challenging the Board's certification decision. On certiorari, the court disagreed, holding that the citizens' complaint was timely filed within 10 days of the Board's final decision because the cause of action accrued on March 6, 2008, when the Board made its final certification decision rather than on February 20, 2008, when it accepted half of the petition signatures as valid. The amended complaint related back to the original complaint and was timely. The names of inactive voters should have been included in the total number of registered voters, and to the extent that Md. Code Ann., Elec. Law &sect; 3-503 (2005) provided otherwise, the statute was unconstitutional. Because many signatures were invalid, the Board improperly certified the referendum.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the circuit court. The court entered summary judgment on behalf of the citizens.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene amended petitioner health care provider's hospice care license to exclude the provider from providing home-based hospice services in two counties. A circuit court reversed the decision. The Court of Special Appeals of Maryland reversed the circuit court's judgment, and directed the circuit court to affirm the Department's final decision. The provider filed a petition for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In deciding to rescind that part of the provider's license relating to providing home-based hospice services in two counties, the Department rejected the provider's interpretation of &sect; 19-906(c)(3) of the Health-General Article (2000, 2005 Repl. Vol.). The disputed statutory interpretation issue presented was whether the provider's provision of home-based bereavement services to family members of the dying or deceased persons, in the two counties during the year 2001, constituted the provision of home-based hospice services to a patient in those counties within the meaning of &sect; 19-906(c)(3). The provider argued that the provision of bereavement services to family members qualified under the statute, whereas the Department contended that the only services which qualified under &sect; 19-906(c)(3) were services rendered to the dying person. The state high court found that an interpretation of &sect; 19-906(c)(3), which excluded bereavement services to a family, based upon a difference in phraseology between &quot;to a patient&quot; and &quot;for a patient,&quot; was unreasonable. Therefore, the provider was performing home-based hospice services in the two counties during 2001.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the intermediate appellate court was vacated, and the case was remanded to the intermediate appellate court with directions to affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

The question presented was whether the special committee, which was formed pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 2-407 (2004 Repl. Vol.), possessed subpoena power in the course of its duties. The state high court found that the provision granting the Legislative Policy Committee the authority to appoint a special committee in Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 2-407(b)(3) (2004 Repl. Vol.) (amended 2007) necessarily carried with it the implied power to delegate subpoena power to the special committee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought certiorari review of a decision of the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) that affirmed a circuit court's decision to grant petitioner inmate's post-conviction petition. The State claimed that the inmate waived his challenge to advisory jury instructions, a Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 465 (1971) jurisdiction instruction, and that counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the instructions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's claim that advisory jury instructions violated the reasoning in Stevenson and Montgomery was rejected because those cases did not announce new law. By not objecting at trial or on direct appeal, claims based on Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 23 were waived. Although the lower courts erroneously analyzed the waiver issue as being governed by Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect;  7-106(c) (2001), caselaw and the plain error doctrine precluded review. The court declined to exercise discretion to review the waiver issue because of the potential for unfair prejudice to the State due to a 20-year delay. The inmate's objections to the jury instructions and special verdicts regarding jurisdiction were waived by a failure to object at trial or raise the issue on direct appeal. The ineffective assistance claim failed both prongs of the Strickland test. That claim concerned whether Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 465 (1971) addressed venue or expanded jurisdiction. Because either interpretation was reasonable, counsel's performance was not deficient for failing to object. Further, counsel properly preserved his argument that &sect; 465 did not expand Maryland's territorial jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the court of special appeals that affirmed the grant of the postconviction petition and reversed the finding as to effective assistance of counsel. The case was remanded to that court with directions to affirm in part and reverse in part the circuit court's judgment and to remand to that court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question before the court was whether petitioner's complaint was erroneously dismissed by the circuit court on the ground that the causes pleaded were barred by limitations.

The instant court interpreted &sect; 1367(d) differently than did the Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals. The court concluded that &sect; 1367(d) did, indeed, suspend the running of limitations and did not merely extend the period, that the suspension remained in effect until 30 days after all federal proceedings, including appellate proceedings, were concluded, and that Md. R. 2-101(b) could be read in harmony with &sect; 1367(d), as so construed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state court of appeals issued a writ of certiorari in the instant criminal case to decide whether a trial court erred by denying defendant's motion for a new trial where the guilty verdicts were rendered by a jury which had never been sworn.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both the trial transcript and the docket entries rebutted any presumption of regularity. The trial transcript clearly showed that the jury was not sworn before the jurors were dismissed for lunch. When the jury reconvened after lunch, the transcript revealed that the court proceeded directly with opening statements, without the oath being administered to the jury. According to the trial transcript, which the official reporter of the court certified as being complete and accurate, the jury was not sworn at any point during the trial. The docket entry stating that the jury was not sworn reinforced the accuracy of the transcript. Thus, any presumption of regularity was overcome in the instant case. The jury in defendant's case was never sworn. Defendant established that the jury was not sworn in violation of Md. R. 4-312(h), Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 5, and Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 21, that there was no waiver of defendant's objection to the unsworn jury, and that, because the jury was never sworn, the harmless error doctrine was not applicable. Therefore, the court of appeals reversed on the ground that the jury was never sworn.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Since the jury which convicted defendant was never sworn, defendant's convictions were reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The telecommunications company appealed a sales and use taxes assessment by respondent, the Maryland Comptroller of the Treasury to the Maryland Tax Court. The Tax Court affirmed the assessment. A circuit court affirmed the assessment. The Court of Special Appeals of Maryland also affirmed the assessment. The telecommunications company filed a petition for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Maryland, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 11-101(m)(5) (2004 Repl. Vol.), imposed sales and use taxes on charges made by out-of-state vendors to Maryland consumers of telecommunications information services beginning with the area code &quot;900.&quot; The parties contested whether the telecommunications company, over whose long-distance lines the communications from out-of-state vendors were transmitted to Maryland consumers, was obligated to collect the tax from the Maryland consumers and, failing to have done that, to be responsible for payment of the tax to the Comptroller. The state high court found that the uncontested factual findings established only that the telecommunications company acted as a common carrier with regard to the 900 number transactions at issue. Thus, the telecommunications company could not be held responsible for the 900 number sales and use taxes on transactions between Maryland consumers and the information services vendors without violating the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Comptroller's assessment against the telecommunications company under Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 11-101(o)(2) (2004 Repl. Vol.) was not permissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother filed a petition for a writ of certiorari after the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) affirmed a circuit court's finding that respondent, the mother's former partner, was a de facto parent and was entitled to visitation with the mother's adopted child. The petition was granted to determine whether an exceptional circumstances standard, rather than a best interests standard, applied to visitation with a de facto parent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and partner had been in a committed same-sex relationship. The partner filed a complaint in the circuit court, seeking custody of the mother's adopted child or visitation. The circuit court denied her custody but found that she was a de facto parent and granted her visitation. The court of special appeals affirmed. The supreme court held that the circuit court erred in granting visitation to the partner on the ground that she was a de facto parent without first finding that the mother was an unfit parent or that sufficient exceptional circumstances existed to overcome the mother's liberty interest in the care, custody, and control of her child under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. De facto parenthood was not recognized in Maryland. Therefore, the supreme court concluded that in order to overcome the constitutional rights of a legal parent to govern the care, custody, and control of his or her child, even a person who would qualify as a de facto parent, who sought visitation or custody, had to demonstrate exceptional circumstances as a prerequisite to a court's consideration of the best interests of the child as a factor in that decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the judgment of the court of special appeals and remanded the case to that court with instructions to reverse the judgment of the circuit court and to remand the case to the circuit court to determine whether, based on all relevant facts, exceptional circumstances existed to overcome the mother's liberty interest in the care, custody, and control of the child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Montgomery County Circuit Court (Maryland) entered a final judgment of conviction after a jury found defendant guilty of sexual abuse of a minor in violation of Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law &sect; 3-602 (Cum. Supp. 2006). The state supreme court granted certiorari on its own initiative to hear defendant's appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for, inter alia, sexual abuse of a minor regarding the alleged sexual abuse of his niece. At the time of the alleged abuse, defendant was married to the niece's mother's sister. Between the time of the incident and trial, defendant and his wife divorced. However, he never raised the argument that his status did not fall within the Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law &sect; 3-601(a)(3) (Cum. Supp. 2006) definition of &quot;family member&quot; or that Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law &sect; 3-602 (Cum. Supp. 2006), regarding sexual abuse of a minor, was unconstitutional. A jury found him guilty of the sexual abuse of a minor. The state's highest court found that (1) his failure to raise the issue of whether Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law &sect; 3-602 (Cum. Supp. 2006) was unconstitutional meant that the issue was not preserved for appellate review, (2) defense counsel's question about whether a &quot;divorced uncle&quot; qualified as a family member did not preserve for review a question about defendant's status since he was not a &quot;divorced uncle&quot; at the time of the incident, and (3) defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim had to be raised in a post-conviction proceeding rather than on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

Although the circuit court found substantial evidence supporting the administrative law judge's decision to suspend the licensee's license for 25 days, the circuit court reversed the referral to the MAB because the licensee did not receive notice on the DR-15 form that by exercising her right to a hearing under Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 16-205.1(f)(7) (1977, 2006 Repl. Vol.), she was subjecting herself to a possible referral to the MAB. Because a referral to the MAB was not an administrative sanction within the meaning of Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 16-205.1(b), the court held that the DR-15 Advice of Rights form did not need to include notice that an administrative law judge, after conducting a hearing requested by a driver to modify the suspension of the driver's license, could refer the driver to the MAB.</SPAN></P>

The mortgagor claimed that her due process rights, guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment and Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24, were violated by the failure to receive advance notice of the sale. In affirming the trial court's decision, the court held that mortgagees were not required to personally serve property owners with notices of foreclosure to satisfy due process. The court also held that Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 7-105, and Md.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supervisors' employer, a correctional facility within the DPSCS, required them to work overtime and perform non-supervisory tasks in their overtime capacity that were normally assigned to correctional officers, but did not pay them overtime. The supervisors filed a grievance; the ALJ agreed with the DPSCS's position. The high court held that the supervisors were exempt employees under 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 213(a)(1) of the FLSA because they were employed as bona fide administrative or professional employees. They were deemed administrative or professional employees under 29 C.F.R. &sect; 541.2 (2002) since they were paid salaries, exercised discretion and independent judgment, and performed office or non-manual work directly related to management policies. That Md. Code Ann., State Pers. &amp; Pens. &sect; 11-104, subjected them (and all state employees) to suspension without pay as a disciplinary sanction did not mean they were not salaried employees. They qualified for the administrative or professional employee exemption under 29 C.F.R. &sect; 541.1(f) (2002) because they were engaged in management of the enterprise and supervised two or more employees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner requested an administrative hearing after the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) cancelled his Maryland driver's license. An administrative law judge (ALJ) sustained the cancellation. The Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland) affirmed the ALJ's ruling. Petitioner was granted certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was a citizen of Mexico who had previously had a driver's license in California, Virginia, and New Jersey. Prior to coming to Maryland, petitioner's New Jersey license was withdrawn because he misrepresented facts on his application. Upon learning of New Jersey's withdrawal, MVA cancelled petitioner's Maryland license. The court of appeals concluded that the plain wording of Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 16-103.1 supported the MVA's decision and that nothing in &sect; 16-103.1 created an exception where a cancellation in another state was for conduct that would not warrant that result in Maryland. Thus, the fact that Maryland would issue a driver's license to a person who was not a United States citizen was of no consequence. Petitioner also claimed that &sect; 16-103.1 violated Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24. The court of appeals disagreed, noting that the fact that the New Jersey revocation was permanent did not make the Maryland reciprocity statute unconstitutional. The court of appeals also noted that petitioner's license was not suspended in New Jersey because he was an illegal residence, but because he forced documents to obtain a license, and Maryland would do the same.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner retired officers, and others, filed a complaint against a city, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief relating to the city's denial of the officers' claims requesting increased pension benefits. A civil service board denied the claims. The trial court reversed the board. The Court of Special Appeals of Maryland reversed the trial court. The retired officers sought certiorari review, and their request was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city interpreted Annapolis, Md., Code &sect; 3.36.150A1 as denying the officers increased pension benefits in tandem with raises given to their active duty counterparts. Initially, the appellate court held that the intermediate appellate court did not err in denying the officers' motion to dismiss. Annapolis, Md., Code &sect; 3.16.150A limited the applicability of the appeal provisions solely to &quot;permanent status civil service employees.&quot; The officers were non-active, retired persons, and thus not &quot;permanent status employees.&quot; The trial court could have only acted on the complaint to review the board's actions by way of a common law or equity writ. The trial court erred by failing to enter a written declaration of the rights of the parties, but this error was not jurisdictional. Contrary to the city's position, Annapolis, Md., Code &sect; 3.36.150A1 was clear and unambiguous, and supported the officers' position. The section meant just what it said, that the officers were entitled to receive increases in their pensions in tandem to any increases in salaries that active police officers and firefighters of the same rank and same number of years of service received from the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the intermediate appellate court was reversed as to its interpretation of Annapolis, Md., Code &sect; 3.36.150A1. The case was remanded for the trial court to enter an appropriate declaratory judgment order and for further proceedings. Otherwise, the judgment was affirmed in part.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother appealed the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland), which affirmed trial court judgments terminating her parental rights to two of her children. Respondent, a county Department of Social Services (DSS), had petitioned the trial court and had acquired an adjudication that the children were in need of assistance. The trial court terminated the mother's rights, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 5-313.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children were six and five years of age at the time of the proceeding. The mother had several interrelated problems: a low intelligence, an oppressive childhood, life-long poverty, was evicted and disqualified from governmental housing assistance due to her drug-dealing mother, failed to maintain steady employment or housing, and other issues. The mother had basically surrendered the children to DSS upon having no place to take them and no means to care for them. The court found various problems with the trial court's considerations under &sect; 5-313, namely that it found that it was not sure whether the children had any attachment left to the mother. Further, the trial court indicated that the mother did a pretty good job of maintaining communication with DSS, but that it was not sufficient to guarantee the safety and health of the children, without explaining the connection between any lack of communication and the safety and health of the children. Overall, the trial court did not relate its findings under &sect; 5-313 to the presumption favoring continuation of the parental relationship or to any exceptional circumstance that would suffice to rebut that presumption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the special appellate court and remanded the case to that court with instructions for it to vacate the judgments of the trial court and remand the case to the trial court. On remand, the trial court was directed to make clear and specific findings with respect to each of the relevant statutory factors and permit the parties to present additional evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the denial of his motion to suppress, defendant was convicted of possessing a regulated firearm and possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance. Defendant was sentenced to five years, without parole on the firearm count and 12 years on the drug charge. The Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) vacated the trial court's judgments and remanded the case. Defendant's petition for a writ certiorari was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the Fourth Amendment and Maryland law required that the evidence seized should have been excluded from his trial because the police officers did not knock and announce their presence prior their search of a house. The supreme court concluded that, under the particular circumstances of the instant case, the evidence was excludable if there was a violation of Maryland's &quot;knock and announce&quot; principle. The supreme court noted that a judicial officer in Maryland, under Maryland law, could not issue a &quot;no-knock&quot; warrant. Rather, the propriety of the &quot;no-knock&quot; entry was to be reviewed and determined on the basis of the facts known to the officers at the time of entry, rather than at the time of the application for the warrant. Defendant also argued that the evidence supporting his handgun conviction was insufficient because the State never established that he had an interest in or residence in the house, or that he had ever been in proximity to the handgun. The supreme court agreed, noting, inter alia, that the evidence did not show whether defendant was residing in the home at the time or simply visiting a residence of the home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the court of appeals remanding the case for a new suppression hearing was affirmed. Defendant's conviction on the firearm count was reversed. The case was remanded to the trial court with directions to reverse the judgment as to the conviction for possession of a firearm and for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent neighbors objected to the issuance of building permits to petitioner property owner. The appeals were dismissed by the county board of appeals. The neighbors petitioned for judicial review. The circuit court remanded the case to the board. The owner appealed to the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland, which reversed the circuit court, reinstated the board's dismissal, and remanded the case to the board.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner received a county building permit to erect four amateur radio towers on his property. Upon seeing construction trucks, work being done, and holes being drilled on the owner's property, the neighbors, the abutting property owners, became aware, for the first time, of the permits that were issued for the erecting of the towers. The neighbors contended that they had a due process right to actual notice of the issuance of the building permits. The state supreme court found that the county code section applicable to the issuance of permits created no right of notice nor did it create any additional property rights in the neighbors that they did not have inherently. Further, because the county code section applicable to the issuance of permits as a ministerial act did not require the service of actual, personal notice to the neighbors, the failure to do that which was not required to be done was not a denial of due process. Furthermore, generally, the issuance of building permits and similar permits was a ministerial act. Finally, the issuance of the building permits to the owner for construction on his property created no additional property rights in the neighbors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The part of the intermediate appellate court's judgment that remanded the case to the county board to receive evidence as to whether the issuance of the building permit infringed upon the neighbors' property rights was reversed. The judgment of the intermediate appellate court as to the nonrenewal of the building permit and the timeliness or lack thereof was affirmed so that the decision of the county board was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant circuit court clerks denied marriage licenses to certain same-sex couples, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 2-201 (2006). The Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland) granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs, same-sex couples and a homosexual male, but stayed enforcement of its ruling pending the resolution of the expected appeal, pursuant to Md. R. 2-632. The instant court issued a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court found that because &sect; 2-201 did not abridge the fundamental right to marriage, did not discriminate on the basis of sex in violation of Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 46, and did not otherwise implicate a suspect or quasi-suspect class, the marriage statute was subject to rational review. The State's legitimate interests in fostering procreation and encouraging the traditional family structure in which children were born were related reasonably to the means employed by Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 2-201 (2006). As Md. Const. Decl. Rights. art. 46 was not intended by the General Assembly and the Maryland voters who enacted and ratified the Maryland Equal Rights Amendment in 1972 to reach classifications based on sexual orientation, Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 2-201 (2006) did not draw an impermissible sex-based distinction. The statute prohibited equally both men and women from the same conduct. Same-sex marriage was not so deeply rooted in Maryland or the country as a whole that it was a fundamental right protected by Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24, in light of Maryland's history of limiting marriage to those unions between members of the opposite sex.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court's judgment was reversed, the stay was vacated, and the case was remanded to the circuit court with directions to declare constitutional the statute at issue and to deny injunctive relief to plaintiffs. Costs were to be paid by plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former client was terminated from her employment. She hired the attorney to represent her in an employment discrimination lawsuit. The attorney filed a federal lawsuit on her behalf. Eventually, summary judgment was granted on nine of her 10 claims. A jury found for the former employer on the remaining claim. Thereafter, she filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy. She was later granted a discharge in bankruptcy. After disagreements with the attorney, she pursued her case on her own and obtained a monetary judgment. The attorney then filed a complaint on behalf of himself and respondent law firm to enforce an attorney's lien. The trial court ruled that the retainer agreement precluded the attorney's lien. On appeal, the intermediate appellate court found that the language of the retainer agreement did not preclude an attorney lien pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof. 10-501(a). On further review, the state's highest court found that the attorney had not waived the lien under the retainer agreement's language, the lien had not been lost or extinguished by the discharge in bankruptcy, and her due process rights had not been violated by imposition of the lien.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Special Court of Appeals (Maryland) affirmed the trial court's judgment and concluded that the search warrant involved in a search of a motel room was supported by probable cause and, thus, the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress drug evidence supporting his drug convictions was proper. The state's highest court granted defendant's petition for a writ of certiorari and the State's cross-petition for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer made a traffic stop of defendant's vehicle.  Defendant then ran away. The officer briefly lost sight of defendant but was able to arrest him by a wooded area. A gun holster was recovered from underneath him. Police searching the chase area also found an ammunition magazine. Police then watched a motel room where defendant took temporary residence. Thirty-four days after the traffic stop, they executed a search warrant there. The search team found drugs and drug paraphernalia there. Defendant was arrested on drug charges. His motion to suppress was denied. The intermediate appellate court affirmed. The state's highest court found that the warrant issued by the magistrate was not supported by probable cause since the State's theory that defendant had returned and retrieved the gun from the chase scene was mere speculation; however, it also found the warrant was based on evidence sufficient to create disagreement between judges about whether probable cause existed. As a result, it found police officers were objectively reasonable in relying on the warrant under the Leon good-faith exception to support their belief that the gun was at defendant's temporary residence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A due process complaint was also filed against appellee, a county board of education, under Md. Code Ann., Educ. &sect;&sect; 8-401 to 8-417 (1978, 2006 Repl. Vol.). An individualized educational program (IEP) was created for the parents' child, who suffered from, inter alia, bipolar disorder; the parties also executed a medication form. When the school nurse contacted the child's psychiatrist for clarification of when her medication should be administered, the parents requested that the psychiatrist no longer provide medical information to the school. The school then indicated that its staff would no longer administer the medications and that the parents could come to the school to administer the medications. The parents sought a due process hearing under 20 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1415 and Md. Code Ann., Educ. &sect; 8-413(d), but the ALJ found subject matter jurisdiction did not exist. On appeal, the court affirmed. While the absence of an &quot;administration of medication&quot; provision from the four corners of the IEP did not preclude such administration as a &quot;related service,&quot; subject matter jurisdiction was lacking because the dispute  involved a medical treatment issue rather than a special education issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The intermediate appellate court reasoned that respondents were not required to consider the economic infeasibility of preservation when deciding whether to designate the property as historic. The court agreed. Under Md. Ann. Code art. 66B, &sect; 8.02, a local body had to consider whether the subject property had historical, archaeological, or architectural significance. It was only after property was designated historic and a development permit application was maintained that the statutory scheme, through Md. Ann. Code art. 66B, &sect;&sect; 8.06(b), 8.09, and 8.10 (2003), required that economic feasibility and financial hardship be considered in determining whether a permit should be issued. Next, the regulatory takings claim was premature, as there had been no final denial of petitioner's demolition permit application. Finally, failing to consider economic impact was not a denial of due process. Respondents had given petitioner full and fair hearings on the issue of the historical/architectural significance of the property, and there remained an opportunity for petitioner to present evidence regarding economic feasibility in connection with the demolition permit application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant individuals brought suit against appellee county election board and voter, seeking to stay the Circuit Court for Carroll County (Maryland)'s order that approved an agreement between the voter and board to adopt a redistricting plan creating five commissioner districts in the county, effectually creating a new method of election of commissioners. The appellate court issued a writ of certiorari on its own initiative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court, in adopting the consent order that approved the plan to elect county commissioners by district rather than at-large, went beyond the functions of the judiciary and interfered with the legislature's authority to redistrict. In issuing the order, the circuit court assumed a role that belonged to the legislative and executive departments of state government under Md. Const. art. VII, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2. No legislation served as the basis for the consent order as a house bill that would have adopted a county redistricting plan had failed to pass the state senate. That failure to adopt a redistricting plan in no way authorized the circuit court to take action. It was not the place of the appellate court to adopt a redistricting plan for the county as it was not permitted to act until the legislature had acted. In other words, the power of judicial review did not equate to the power to exercise functions that were explicitly vested in the other organs of government. Finally, the circuit court had no authority under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 3-409(a), to act as the initial controversy over the election was rendered moot when it approved the consent order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court's approval of the consent order was a clear violation of the Maryland Constitution.</SPAN></P>

After the political party appealed, the state's highest court issued a writ of certiorari to allow it to review the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The political party applicant filed a petition to form a new political party and nominate a certain person as its candidate for President of the United States. Appellee state elections board, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Elec. Law &sect; 6-203 (2003), invalidated several signatures affixed to the nominating petition. As a result, the petition fell short of the required number of signatures. The political party applicant and the state elections board stipulated that a certain number of invalidated signatures--enough to meet the signature requirement--were invalidated solely on the basis that the signers, registered voters in the State, were registered in a county other than the one specified on the petition sheets they signed; in other words, they signed the petition sheet for the &quot;wrong county.&quot; The sole issue in the case was whether, when the signatories were otherwise eligible to vote in Maryland, the State's invalidation of &quot;wrong county&quot; signatures was proper. The trial court found that conduct proper. On further review, the state's highest court found that the law was invalid in the present case since it disenfranchised voters without a valid constitutional basis for doing so.</SPAN></P>

The state's highest court granted the lessees' petition for writ of certiorari to review the ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessees entered into commercial leases with the lessor to lease motor vehicles. Pursuant to the lease agreements, the lessor charged a late fee on any payment not received within 10 days after it was due. Each lessee contended that the lessor assessed, and each lessee paid, a single late fee for failing to remit timely a monthly amount due. Thereafter, the lessees filed a first-amended complaint asserting that the charge was an illegal amount of interest in violation of Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 57, which stated the legal rate of interest unless the General Assembly provided otherwise. The trial court dismissed the first amended complaint for failing to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. On appeal, the state supreme court found that the late fees were permissibly imposed because the General Assembly had provided a law for imposition of them, Md. Code Ann., Com. Law &sect; 14-2002(g)(1)(i) (Repl. Vol. 2000), Md. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A dispute arose over the construction of a wind turbine facility. Although two of the landowners submitted citizen comment letters following the conclusion of an adjudicatory hearing conducted by the Commission, neither they, nor a conservation association, sought to intervene. One of the landowners then, on behalf of the association, requested a rehearing. After the Commission denied the request, the owners filed their petitions for judicial review under Md. Code Ann., Pub. Util. Cos. &sect; 3-202(a) (1998). The state supreme court found that the landowners failed timely to apply to intervene as parties, under Md. Code Ann., Pub. Util. Cos. &sect; 3-106 (1998), before the Commission and, therefore, the applications for rehearing were not properly submitted by &quot;parties in interest,&quot; under Md. Code Ann., Pub. Util. Cos. &sect; 3-114(c) (1998). As a result, there was no timely application for rehearing under &sect; 3-114(c). Additionally, the petitions for judicial review were untimely under Md. R. 7-203 because the time for filing a petition for judicial review was not stayed by the association's' application. Thus, the decisions of the Commission and the trial court were correct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father, joined by putative appellee gestational carrier, filed a petition asking the circuit court to issue &quot;accurate&quot; birth certificates that did not list the gestational carrier as the mother of his twins. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) rejected the petition. The father appealed and the Court of Appeals of Maryland, on its own motion, granted certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father contracted with the carrier to carry an embryo. Two fertilized eggs were implanted in the carrier and she delivered twins. The carrier was listed as the &quot;mother&quot; of the children as a result of the hospital following the requirements of Md. Code Ann., Health-Gen. &sect; 4-208 (Supp. 2006). The issue on appeal was whether the name of the carrier had to be listed on the birth certificates for the twins. The father's primary contention, under the Maryland Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), was that the parentage statutes of Maryland did not afford equal protection of the law to men and women similarly situated because the parentage statutes allowed a man to deny paternity and did not allow a woman to deny maternity. The court of appeals held that Md. Code Ann., Health-Gen. &sect;&nbsp;4-211 (Supp. 2006), did not preclude a court from issuing an order authorizing a birth certificate that did not list the mother's name. The trial court's implication of the best interest of the child standard was error, as the carrier wanted to relinquish her parental rights, not assert them, and there was no issue of unfitness as to the father.</SPAN></P>

The driver challenged the suspension. An administrative law judge (ALJ) found the driver to be in violation of Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 16-205.1 (Supp. 2006). The ALJ's ruling was based on a form filed by the arresting police officer. That form indicated that early one morning, the police officer saw the driver operating his vehicle in excess of 132 miles per hour, that he stopped the vehicle, that there was a strong odor of alcohol on the driver's breath, that the driver had bloodshot and watery eyes, that the driver blew a preliminary breath test of 0.10, and that the driver admitted drinking two beers. On appeal, the trial court vacated the ALJ's ruling because it found that the arresting police officer had not stated the reason that field sobriety tests, which the driver failed, were not performed to the police officer's satisfaction. On further review, the state's highest court found that the administrative ruling was based on substantial evidence and was not rendered based on an erroneous conclusion of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county enacted a zoning ordinance that imposed a minimum lot size requirement of 25,000 square feet in used vehicle dealerships. Respondent used car dealers filed an action in the trial court to challenge the constitutionality of the ordinance, as well as to seek declaratory and injunctive relief. The used car dealers all had standing to challenge the ordinance because they all operated used car lots that did not meet the new minimum lot size requirement of 25,000 square feet. However, the used car dealers did not institute any administrative proceedings seeking variances or other administrative remedies. The trial held a nonjury trial to consider the impact the ordinance would have on their particular businesses. The trial court then ruled that the ordinance violated substantive due process and equal protection principles. It also enjoined enforcement of the ordinance. The intermediate appellate court then affirmed the trial court's ruling. On further review, the state's highest court found that the used car dealers were required to invoke and exhaust their administrative remedies and they did not show that any exception to the exhaustion requirement applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The relatives contended that appellees actively sought the cooperation of the public in combatting illicit drug trade, but failed to protect the decedents from retaliation after the decedents reported drug deals. The relatives argued that appellees violated the decedents' state constitutional rights by failing to protect the decedents from a danger created by appellees, and that appellees were negligent in their efforts to protect the decedents. The appellate court held that the relatives failed to state any claim against appellees. The State of Maryland did not recognize the state-created-danger theory as a basis upon which to recover for violations of Maryland's Constitution and, in any event, there was no affirmative act of appellees toward the decedents to implicate the theory. Further, no special relationship between appellees and the decedents was created by the decedents' reports, appellees' responses to the reports, or appellees promise to place the decedents on a special protection list. Thus, in the absence of a special relationship, appellees general duty to protect the public was not extended to a special duty to protect the decedents.</SPAN></P>

The public defender believed the directive was both substantively unlawful and constituted an impermissible local rule. It imposed certain procedural requirements on parties who filed exceptions to the report of a master in juvenile cases and permitted the court to dismiss the exceptions if those requirements were not met. The directive commanded the court clerk to enter the order in each exceptions case, so that the order and its requirements were case-specific. The state's highest court denied the public defender's petition for relief and revoked a stay it had entered while it was considering the petition request.

The candidate was granted summary judgment. The voter appealed and filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the candidate met the requirements of Md. Const. art. V, &sect; 4. Under the constitutional provision's plain language, the appellate court read &quot;practiced law in this State for at least ten years&quot; to mean that one who sought to be Attorney General must have practiced law for 10 years, in Maryland, as a member of the Maryland Bar. In essence, the practice requirement related not solely to the practice of law in Maryland, but to its practice in Maryland as a member of the Maryland Bar. The appellate court's interpretation was consistent with the history of the constitutional provision and its context. The candidate's federal bar membership, which allowed him to practice law in Maryland, did not count toward his eligibility to be the Attorney General as neither 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 517 nor U.S. Dist. Ct., D. Md., R. 701(1)(b), authorized a Maryland state law practice. Thus, the circuit court erred in holding that the candidate had practiced law in Maryland for 10 years. The candidate's admission to the Maryland Bar six years ago, coupled with his lengthy, but primarily, federal practice of law was insufficient to meet the requirements of Md. Const. art. V, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the special appellate court erred in affirming the trial court's interpretation and application of the intent element for the crime of second-degree murder. The court determined that, as trier of fact, the trial judge was permitted, but not required, to infer from petitioner's wilful act of thrusting the knife outward and into the victim that petitioner intended to commit such grievous bodily harm from which death would likely ensue; however, the trier of fact was not permitted to presume, from petitioner's conduct, that he intended to inflict grievous bodily harm as a matter of law or to presume anything from his use of the knife. The trial judge's mistaken conclusions of law, which modified the specific intent requirement and unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof to petitioner, warranted reversal of petitioner's conviction for murder in the second degree and entitled him to a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The property owners appealed to the intermediate appellate court, but the state's highest court issued a writ of certiorari to the intermediate appellate court to review the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The civil detainee was adjudged incompetent to stand trial in the trial court on multiple criminal charges filed against him because his delusional disorder prevented him from understanding the adversarial nature of the proceedings, and precluded him from assisting in his criminal defense. He was committed to a state health institution for treatment. The state mental health department convened a Clinical Review Panel, which approved his forcible medication of the civil detainee; that decision was upheld by an administrative law judge. The trial court reversed and the state's highest court, which on its own issued a writ of certiorari to review the case, held that Md. Code Ann., Health-Gen. &sect; 10-708(g) (Repl. Vol. 2005) required the State to prove that an individual, because of his mental illness, was dangerous to himself or others within a state institution before it could forcibly administer medication. The state's highest court determined that there was nothing in the record indicating that he was, because of his mental illness, dangerous to himself or others within the state institution where he was being held. Thus, it found that he could not be forcibly medicated.</SPAN></P>

For the assault, he was sentenced to ten years, and, for the false imprisonment, he was sentenced to consecutive life imprisonment with all but ten years suspended. No probation was imposed as to the suspended sentence. The Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) affirmed the sentence, and defendant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said his life sentence was unconstitutionally disproportionate. The court of appeals held defendant's sentences were not illegal. The sentence imposed on the assault conviction was well within the permissible statutory range, and the sentence imposed for false imprisonment, despite its wording, was not a life sentence and had no attribute or collateral consequence of a life sentence. The court effectively imposed two ten-year sentences, one consecutive to the other, which were not unlawful. If, under the sentence as articulated and presumably intended, defendant could never serve over ten years for false imprisonment, the sentence imposed on that conviction could not reasonably be regarded as a life sentence. Because the effective false imprisonment sentence was ten years, it had no attributes of a life sentence, for parole eligibility or any other purpose. As a housekeeping measure, the judgment as recorded had to be amended to reflect the true nature of the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court's judgment was vacated, and the matter was remanded to the trial court to amend its judgment to reflect the true nature of defendant's false imprisonment sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property in question consisted of a three story building which housed a bar and package goods store. The appellate court held that under the Code of Public Local Laws of Baltimore City, Md., &sect; 21-16(a), the city was required to demonstrate the reason or reasons why it was necessary for it to have immediate possession and immediate title to a particular property via the exercise of a quick-take condemnation. The appellate court held that the city failed to present specific evidence to meet this requirement. The petition simply stated that the property would be used for redevelopment purposes and to assist in a business expansion of the area. This statement, in and of itself, while perhaps sufficient to justify regular condemnation, did not justify a quick-take condemnation. The appellate court held that the only plan for the property was that a private developer would possibly, at some future time, create a plan that the city might approve. The appellate court held that this was not sufficient to demonstrate an immediate public interest necessitating the city's use of quick-take condemnation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Special Appeals, Maryland, affirmed the circuit court judgment rejecting petitioner parents' challenge to the constitutionality of Maryland's grandparental visitation statute (GVS), Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 9-102 (1984, 2004 repl. vol.), and granting respondent grandparents' petition for visitation of their minor grandchildren. The parents filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents challenged the constitutionality of the GVS on its face and as applied to them, based on their fundamental right, safeguarded by the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, to direct and control their children's upbringing. The court rejected the facial challenge by reading into the GVS a presumption, recognized under the Due Process Clause and Maryland common law, that parental decisions regarding their children were valid. So construed, the GVS was facially valid. However, the GVS was unconstitutional as applied because it potentially worked a direct and substantial interference with the parents' fundamental right to parent. While the State had a compelling interest in encouraging the grandparents' contributions to their grandchildren's lives, the GVS required narrow tailoring to vindicate the State's interest without burdening the parents' fundamental right. Thus, the GVS required a finding of parental unfitness or exceptional circumstances showing detriment to the children, absent visitation from the grandparents, as a prerequisite to application of the best interests analysis. Absent such a finding, the GVS was unconstitutional as applied to the parents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents claimed in their complaint that their son's autism spectrum disorder was caused by thimerosal used in pediatric vaccines administered to their son as an infant. It was neither an abuse of discretion by the trial court to deny respondents' motion to dismiss nor error of law to enter summary judgment in favor of the corporations. The trial judge found that significant time and money had been expended by both sides in this litigation. The trial judge found that there had been no lack of diligence on the part of respondents' local Maryland counsel in representing them. Next, that a party provided an adequate explanation for the need to dismiss without prejudice did not compel the trial judge to grant the motion. Moreover, if motions for summary judgment were not pending formally at the time of the Md. R. 2-506(b) motion, respondents hardly could have been uncognizant of the likelihood that renewed motions for summary judgment would be forthcoming, following their expert's withdrawal, considering especially that the corporations filed dispositive motions at virtually each earlier critical juncture of the litigation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the case was removed, a jury in the Circuit Court for Worcester County (Maryland) convicted defendant of two counts of first degree murder and sentenced him to death. After the case was removed and returned to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland), a jury sentenced defendant to death at a resentencing hearing. Defendant appealed the denial of his postconviction motions and his motion for a temporary restraining order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant murdered the victim and a bystander to prevent the victim and his wife from testifying in a trial. On appeal, the court found that defendant's complaints regarding a new sentencing hearing based on ineffective assistance of counsel for counsel having failed to investigate and present mitigating evidence and a new trial based on the prosecution exercising peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory manner were not cognizable in a motion under Md. R. 4-345(a) to correct an illegal sentence. Further, the sentencing court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reopen post conviction proceedings under Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 7-102, 7-103, 7-104, and 7-106 on defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, racially motivated peremptory strikes, and selective prosecution. Finally, while the execution protocols of the Maryland Division of Corrections were consistent with Md. Code Ann., Corr. Servs. &sect; 3-905, which prescribed the method of execution by lethal injection, they constituted a regulation under Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 10-101(g) that was not adopted in conformance with the procedural requirements of the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments of the sentencing court as to the denials of defendant's postconviction motions were affirmed. The order of the sentencing court denying the temporary restraining order was vacated, and the case was remanded with instructions to enjoin the enforcement of the lethal injection checklist in the Execution Operations Manual until the list was properly adopted as regulations or exempted by the Maryland General Assembly.</SPAN></P>

He did not seek judicial review of this determination within ten days. The court of appeals held Md. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 3(b) allowed him to file the signatures required to submit the subject of his petition to a popular vote in two steps, consisting of filing valid signatures of at least one percent of the voters by June 1, triggering an additional 30-day period within which the signatures of the additional two percent of the voters could be gathered. The signatures the proponent filed by June 1 were a petition, and, when the secretary of state found the number of those signatures to be insufficient to trigger the additional 30-day period, the proponent had 10 days to seek judicial review, under Md.

III, &sect; 49 validated the Maryland General Assembly's constitutional power to regulate the time, place, and manner of elections. The state supreme court found that, because the acts authorizing Md. Code Ann., Elec. Law &sect; 10-301.1 were inconsistent with and in derogation of certain provisions of the Maryland Constitution, in particular Md. Const. art. XV, &sect; 7 and Md. Const. art.

The court found that the property at issue was in operation as an automobile filling station pursuant to a special exception. Once that use began, either the nonconforming use was immediately terminated or, at a minimum, the six month period of abandonment started in respect to the prior nonconforming use status of the property. Those six months passed and the nonconforming use, if not sooner terminated, was abandoned.

Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 11-705(d). The court of appeals noted that if &quot;residence&quot; were simply a &quot;living location,&quot; as the court of special appeals found, a homeless registrant might have to notify the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Service of a change in residences at least every seven days, if not more frequently, with the prospect that the new residence listed in each notice may be out of date and inaccurate. The court of appeals concluded that such a result was inconsistent with the framework of the statute. Because the trial court clearly concluded that defendant was homeless and did not have a place to go, it followed that no rational trier of fact could have concluded that defendant had a &quot;residence&quot; within the meaning of &sect;&nbsp;11-705(d).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Montgomery County (Maryland) convicted defendant of failing to register as a sexually violent offender by failing to provide notice of change of address to the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services in violation of Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support his conviction, as he could not register a change of residence because he had no residence to register. The State contended that defendant's residence changed when he became homeless and that defendant could have reported this change by notifying the appropriate authority of the location or locations he was occupying once he became homeless. The court of appeals held that defendant did not need to change his address within the meaning of Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 11-705(d) (2005 Cum. Supp.) when became homeless because defendant did not acquire a new &quot;residence&quot; within the meaning of &sect;&nbsp;11-705(d). The court of appeals concluded that a registrant has a &quot;residence&quot; within the meaning of &sect;&nbsp;11-705(d) only if that person has a fixed location at which the registrant is living or one to which the registrant intended to return upon leaving. Given that defendant was staying wherever he could, no rational trier of fact could have found that defendant had a fixed location to which he intended to return.

The trial court granted the department's motion for summary judgment, ruling that the denial of wetland fill permits and sewer hookups did not constitute a taking or violate the owners' equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Responding to contaminated drinking water, a county required lots to pass a seasonal percolation test, and the owners' lots were denied on-site septic system permits. The Environmental Protection Agency provided a construction grant for a septic system provided that no sewer service was given to any parcel of land within any wetlands, which included the owners' lots under the 1992 Policy. On appeal, the court found that the owners' lots were not similarly situated to non-mapped wetland lots that received sewer connections. The distinction between mapped and non-mapped wetlands under the 1992 Policy bore a rational relationship to legitimate state interests of fairness, fiscal integrity, and protection of ecological areas. Thus, the owners' equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24 were not violated. There was no taking under U.S. Const. amend. V and Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 40 because the owners failed to demonstrate that the denial of their permits under the 1992 Policy was a proximate cause of their lots being undevelopable and the denials fell within the takings nuisance exception, as leaking septic tanks contaminated the water.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certiorari to petitioner to challenge the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland), which affirmed petitioner's conviction of theft of property having a value of $ 500 or greater and his sentence of 10 years imprisonment. The trial court had denied petitioner's motion to suppress and admitted into evidence several stolen items which were recovered from a residence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On his prior appeal, petitioner challenged the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress evidence, the alleged illegality of his arrest, and the legal sufficiency of the evidence. Petitioner had been stopped in the State of Pennsylvania on suspicion of a traffic violation and of involvement in various burglaries there. After the stop, it was discovered that an outstanding arrest warrant for him existed. During the search incident to the arrest, the evidence of the stolen items from both the Maryland and Pennsylvania burglaries was discovered. Subsequently, a Pennsylvania court determined that the initial stop was illegal and violated petitioner's Fourth Amendment rights. Petitioner based his motion to suppress on the illegality of the Pennsylvania stop. The court upheld the denial of petitioner's motion to suppress upon finding that petitioner's arrest pursuant to an outstanding arrest warrant sufficiently attenuated the taint of the traffic stop in Pennsylvania. The court held that any taint from the unconstitutional seizure was dissipated by the subsequent discovery of the outstanding warrant, the subsequent legal arrest on that warrant, and the search incident thereto.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) of appellee mayor and city council's approval of an amendment to a developer's planned unit development proposal. The trial court dismissed the petition, and the owner appealed to the Maryland Court of Special Appeals. The Maryland Court of Appeals issued a writ of certiorari before the intermediate appellate court considered the matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held it had no jurisdiction. The court of appeals held the amendment was a &quot;zoning action&quot; under Md. Ann. Code art. 66B, &sect; 2.09(a)(1)(ii), giving the trial court jurisdiction. The city council's decision was made on grounds focused on a development plan for that plot of land only, rather than an entire zoning district, and thus was considered on an individualized basis. This individual action was the kind of change, focusing on the particulars involved with a specific property and its unique circumstances, contemplated as quasi-judicial in nature. The ordinance approving the amendment was enacted as the result of a quasi-judicial process approving an increase of the number of residential dwelling units permitted and modifying the uses and buildings permitted and their locations and size. The prevailing purpose of the ordinance was to define permissible uses of the specific parcel. The city council's deliberative consideration, after receiving evidence at a required hearing, and approval of specific uses for a specific parcel after making required statutory findings was within the realm of a &quot;zoning action.&quot; Therefore, the landowner was entitled to judicial review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was reversed, and the matter was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Governor of Maryland, the State Treasurer, and the Secretary of State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, challenged the order of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland), which granted a preliminary injunction in favor of appellees, minor resident aliens, by their next friends, and pregnant woman denied medical benefits under Md. Code Ann., Health-Gen. &sect; 15-301(a)(2)(viii) (1982, Repl. Vol. 2005).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants did not appropriate monies for the State Medical Assistance Program to resident alien children and pregnant women who immigrated to the United States on or after August 22, 1996, for Fiscal Year 2006 when it funded the same benefits to citizens and resident aliens who arrived before that date. Federal law expressly provided states with complete discretion to provide wholly state-funded medical benefits to legal residents. The trial court found that the failure of appellants to appropriate funds for medical benefits under &sect; 15-301(a)(2)(viii) violated Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24 and ordered reimbursement of the benefits from the date of the original complaint until final disposition of the case. The court agreed that the failure to appropriate monies for the benefits on the basis of alienage violated art. 24, because the State's reasons for the alienage classification, namely cost savings, was not tailored suitably to serve a compelling state interest. However, the award of retrospective benefits was inappropriate in as much as it was, in effect, an award of past damages to appellees without any determination of appellees' actual damages suffered, if any.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, in part, that portion of the order that affirmatively and prospectively enjoined appellants to provide benefits but vacated, in part, that portion of the order for relief that retrospectively granted benefits to appellees since such action was an award of past damages to appellees without either a final disposition on the merits or a determination of actual damages, if any, suffered by appellees.</SPAN></P>

The Chairman sought to stay &sect;&sect; 12 and 22 of Senate Bill 1 (Md.), which terminated the Commissioners' appointments, from taking effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The General Assembly convened in a special session to consider and pass Senate Bill 1 (Md.). The governor vetoed the bill, and the Senate overrode the governor's veto. The bill was enacted as an &quot;emergency bill&quot; and went into effect immediately. The bill made various changes to the Public Utilities Article in response to an anticipated 72 percent increase in the cost of electricity. The Commissioners were appointed by the governor and served as civil officers of the state. The Chairman contended that &sect;&sect; 12 and 22 violated various constitutional provisions. The appellate court held that the attempt by the General Assembly to remove the incumbent members of the Commission was null and void as an unconstitutional usurpation of the removal power granted to the governor under the provisions of Article II, &sect; 15, and was further null and void as being in violation of Article II, &sect;&sect; 1 and 9 and as being contrary to the provisions of Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 8. It necessarily follows that the provision in &sect; 22 of Senate Bill 1 (Md.) that attempted to delegate legislative power to the Attorney General to terminate the members of the Commission was also unconstitutional, null, and void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the appeals court was whether, during a driver license suspension hearing conducted under Md.

The appeals court found that the administrative record provided no specific or explicit statement indicating whether the ALJ accepted or rejected the driver's proffered testimony. Thus, the appeals court was unable to perform its function. The appeals court also noted that the denial of the subpoena request was inappropriate given the factual circumstances of the case, noting that there was a factual dispute regarding whether the driver was fully advised of the consequences of refusing the breath test, as required by &sect;&nbsp;16-205.1, or whether the driver was misled by the officer's statements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a court clerk, eight legislators, and a private citizen, moved the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) to intervene in an action challenging the constitutionality of Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 2-201 (2004). The trial court denied the motions to intervene, appellants sought review, and, prior to argument in the Maryland Court of Special Appeals, the Maryland Court of Appeals issued a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The underlying case contested the constitutionality of Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 2-201 (2004), defining a valid marriage. The court of appeals held the clerk could not intervene by private counsel. No exceptions to Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 6-106(b) and (c), requiring his representation by the Attorney General, applied. No Maryland statute gave any appellant a right to intervene, under Md. R. 2-214(a)(1). The citizen's and legislators' interest did not differ from the public. The general assembly might have a different institutional &quot;interest,&quot; but individual members had no greater legal interest than other citizens. The Declaratory Judgment Act, Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 3-405(a), did not let the legislators intervene as (1) they had no interest affected by a declaration, under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 3-405(a)(1), and (2) if they met Md. R. 2-214(a)(2)'s &quot;interest&quot; requirement, no appellants showed existing parties might not represent their interests. A claim that the trial court could not find the statute's constitutionality was frivolous, so the Attorney General's refusal to argue it was no basis to intervene.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Frederick County (Maryland), which dismissed the mother's complaint for child support upon the motion of appellee, an alleged father. The mother had filed the child support action against the alleged father claiming that the parties' son was a destitute adult in need of support.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were never married. The child was born in March 1983. The mother claimed that the child was diagnosed with a genetic degenerative bone disorder at the age of 13, as a result of which he had become permanently disabled before reaching the age of 18. The complaint alleged that the child resided with the mother and, by reason of his physical disability, was unable to earn sufficient means to provide for himself. Previously, the mother never sought to have the alleged father's paternity established nor did she collect child support from him. Upon review of the legislative intent behind various statutes and the laws of other states, the court held that the mother was not entitled to pursue a paternity action. The court noted that, had the mother established paternity prior to the child's 18th birthday, she would have been entitled to seek child support for the destitute adult child and the child, directly or, if incompetent, through a guardian, was independently entitled to seek to establish paternity prior to reaching that point and, upon the ascertainment of paternity, to recover child support both during minority and, as a destitute adult child, thereafter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland affirming the denial of his motion to bar retrial following mistrial after the trial court had granted defendant's motion for mistrial during direct examination of the State's first witness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the State's first witness, the trial court declared a mistrial because the State elicited testimony from the witness regarding the search warrant that was inadmissible at trial and that had been previously precluded by the trial judge. After the jury had been released, the trial judge stated that, in his opinion, the State had engaged in prosecutorial misconduct and could not retry defendant. Defendant argued that the declaration of a mistrial constituted an acquittal that barred defendant's retrial under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. If the trial court, in declaring a mistrial, ruled on the sufficiency or weight of the State's evidence, this constituted an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes. The trial judge granted a mistrial because the State elicited inadmissible evidence from a witness. The trial judge did not rule on the sufficiency or weight of the evidence. Furthermore, the trial judge had no evidence before it on which it could have ruled, since the witness had only testified as to the his name and employment.</SPAN></P>
