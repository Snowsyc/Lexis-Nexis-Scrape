</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mother sued appellee father for divorce. The 1st District Court, Jasper County (Texas) ordered that the mother, as joint managing conservator, would have the exclusive right to designate the primary residence of the children within a particular school district, for purposes of Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 153.134(b)(1)(A) (Supp. 2007). The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties settled all issues between them except whether the residence of the mother and the two children was going to be geographically restricted. The trial court ruled that the mother had the right to designate the primary residence of the children within a certain school district. The court affirmed. The trial court did not err in its application of discretion in setting a geographical limitation for purposes of Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 153.134(b)(1)(A). The trial court could have balanced the mother's reasons for the move, including to find a job that made more money, and the effects on the children's extended family relationships and visits with the father and found that it was in the children's best interest to reside with the geographical boundaries of that particular school district. The court rejected a mother's claim that &sect; 153.134(b)(1)(A), as applied to her, created an unconstitutional infringement on her rights. The mother did not bear the burden of refuting any presumption that a restriction would be in the children's best interests, as the trial court had to look at the evidence and determine whether a geographic restriction would be in the children's best interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee claimant sued appellant city, alleging an unconstitutional taking of property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 2006, the city amended its flood-control ordinances. Under the amendment, new residential construction was severely restricted on property located in a floodway. The claimant sued the city alleging that the 2006 amendment constituted an unconstitutional taking of his property, which was in a floodway. The claimant alleged that the amendment effectively deprived him use of his property and drastically reduced its value. The City filed a plea to the jurisdiction, asserting that the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction because the claims were not ripe for adjudication. The appellate court ruled that the claimant alleged a concrete injury. The claimant alleged that the amendments deprived him of the use, benefit and enjoyment of the property because he could not sell it to anyone who desired to construct any improvements in or upon the property. Also, the claimant was not required to apply for a building permit or to seek a variance for his claims to ripen, because seeking a permit or variance would have been futile. The claims were ripe when the claimant filed suit, and the trial court properly denied the city's jurisdictional challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both parents asserted that the evidence was insufficient to support the termination. The reviewing court disagreed. Sufficient evidence supported a termination of parental rights as to five children under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 161.001(1), (2). The evidence included that one of the children was diagnosed with psychosocial dwarfism caused by severe emotional abuse. In a little more than a year after being removed, the child had a four-year growth spurt, his bones, matured, and he grew more than eight inches and gained 22 pounds. The court also held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow two of the children to testify, and the father could not raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because counsel was retained, not appointed. As to a constitutional challenge to Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 263.405(i), the father failed to demonstrate that under no set of circumstances could &sect; 263.405(i) be valid; the court therefore rejected the facial challenge. The statute was also not unconstitutional as applied because the father did not identify any appellate issue that could not be pursued because of the restrictions of &sect; 263.405(i).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant city sought review of an order from the County Court at Law No. 1, Dallas County (Texas), which, in appellee bicycle rider's civil equity lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a helmet ordinance, denied the city's plea to the jurisdiction as to the rider's request for a declaratory judgment and stayed the city's plea as to the rider's request for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The rider was cited under the ordinance for operating or riding his bicycle without wearing a helmet. While the criminal charge was pending against him in the municipal court, he filed his civil equity lawsuit in the county court. Thereafter, the municipal court dismissed the criminal case, and the rider amended his petition to seek both a declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction preventing the city from enforcing the ordinance. The court concluded that the civil equity case became moot when the municipal court dismissed the criminal case. Because the rider had not received any more citations for violating the ordinance, there was no longer a live controversy. The court further held that the capable of repetition, yet evading review, exception to the mootness doctrine did not apply because the rider had not met his burden to show that the time between issuance of a citation and judgment was always so short as to evade review. Moreover, a pending criminal appeal in another case presented the same issue, and the rider had not shown more than a mere physical or theoretical possibility that he might be cited again.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the county court's order and dismissed the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee physician sued appellant medical center officers, alleging, inter alia, tortious interference with existing and prospective business relationships. The 93rd District Court of Hidalgo County (Texas) denied an officer's motion for leave to file a motion for dismissal under the Texas Citizens Participation Act (TCPA), Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue was whether the appellate court had jurisdiction over the interlocutory appeal. The TCPA did not explicitly grant the right to appeal from the denial for motions for leave to file a motion to dismiss. Moreover, the trial court had not expressly ruled that the motion to dismiss was denied by operation of law, nor was such a result inferred given that the motion was filed after the expiration of the statutory deadline. Even if the TCPA allowed an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a motion for leave to file a motion to dismiss, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion given the conflicting evidence as to whether one medical center officer was served.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a jury of aggravated sexual assault. In accordance with the jury's punishment recommendation, the trial court sentenced him to 5 years' confinement, and placed him on community supervision for 10 years. Confinement was not ordered as a condition of community supervision. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal and motion for new trial. The trial court then set bond pending appeal at $ 10,000. Three days later an alias capias was issued for defendant's arrest because he was ineligible for an appeal bond. Defendant filed a petition for writ of mandamus and the trial court responded defendant's mandamus argument was moot because after it issued the warrant and defendant filed his mandamus action, it had withdrawn the order and ordered defendant released on $ 10,000 bond. The appellate court agreed and declined to reach the merits of the issues raised.</SPAN></P>

Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.

Code Ann. &sect; 37.152(a)(3) (2006) by recklessly permitting hazing to occur by failing to supervise students whom he had a duty to supervise pursuant to the educator-student relationship. The County Criminal Court No. 5 of Denton County, Texas, dismissed the indictment, finding that &sect; 37.152(a)(3) was unconstitutional. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a wrestling coach who attended a party at which several student wrestlers slapped or struck other student wrestlers to initiate them into the wrestling team. In affirming the decision to dismiss the indictment, the reviewing court agreed with the trial court that &sect; 37.152(a)(3) was unconstitutionally vague on its face. The court reasoned that the statute failed to identify any person or class of persons upon whom a duty to act, whether statutory or otherwise, was imposed; instead, it simply imposed a duty on every living person in the universe to prevent hazing. The statute was also unconstitutional as applied to defendant. While educators could stand in loco parentis under immunity cases, it was unclear whether they could be criminally punished for failing to prevent hazing. It was also unclear whether defendant, as a wrestling coach, was an &quot;educator.&quot; Even if defendant was an educator under the circumstances of the party, he assumed neither actual care nor custody of the students because the party was not mandatory, and the students' parents were not excluded from attending.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury of the 39th District Court, Haskell County, Texas, convicted defendant of possession of cocaine in an amount of four grams or more but less than 200 grams. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to show that he possessed cocaine found in a coffee can between a shed and a dryer in the backyard of a residence. The reviewing court held that the evidence of affirmative links was sufficient to establish &quot;possession&quot; under Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.002(38) (Supp. 2007). There was evidence that defendant was present when officers searched the residence; defendant lived there; the residence was a party house; marihuana and bags commonly used to package drugs were found in defendant's bedroom; and although defendant did not have a job, he had large amounts of cash. Although there was testimony that another individual gave defendant the cash the day before the search, the jury was the sole judge of the weight and credibility of the witnesses' testimony. The court also held that defendant failed to preserve for review a complaint that the state did not comply with the notice requirements for a certificate of analysis and chain of custody affidavits in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.41-.42 (2005). Finally, any error in instructing on the law of the parties was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain his conviction. The court of appeals disagreed. The evidence showed that defendant had been seeing the victim during the summer of 2004. In July, the victim told defendant that she might be pregnant; tests confirmed she was pregnant. Defendant knew the victim was pregnant and told a witness that he was going to take care of the problem. On the night of September 8, 2004, defendant visited the witness briefly, leaving around 12:15 or 12:30 a.m. He retrieved the shotgun he had recently purchased and shells from his friend's house and placed a call from that home to the victim on her cell phone. Later, witnesses heard three gunshots and screams. The victim's embryo showed no signs of decomposition, indicating that the pregnancy was normal and that the embryo was alive prior to the victim's death. Tests on the two shotgun shell casings found near the victim's body and the one shotgun shell casing found under the back seat of defendant's car confirmed they were fired from the same gun. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction.</SPAN></P>

Defendant did not explain how the extension of those &quot;services&quot; involved the payment or collection of fees for emergency medical personnel. Moreover, defendant used an alias when contacting patients, avoided contacting Caucasian patients, paid for patient information in cash, never sought patient information through the public information office of the fire department, never met with his contact at her place of business, and when he exchanged cash for patient information, he normally rendezvoused with the contact at a restaurant.

Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 161.211(a) (2008).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father executed an affidavit of waiver of interest in the child, and based on that waiver of interest, the mother filed a petition to terminate the parent-child relationship. The father executed a waiver of service of citation as to the termination proceeding, and executed the waiver of interest and agreed order of termination based on the mother's representations to him that they would be married and raise the child together as a family following the father's graduation from college. According to the father, the mother broke off the engagement and ended their relationship. The father filed his original petition for bill of review challenging the agreed termination order based on extrinsic fraud by the mother. The appellate court ruled that the six-month deadline in Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 161.211(a) was not a plea in avoidance, but rather, a bar to or preclusion of a challenge to a termination order more than six months after the termination order was signed. The agreed termination order was signed November 24, 2009, and the father filed his original petition for bill of review on September 29, 2010.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant of telephone harassment under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.07(a)(4) (2003), and the court affirmed the judgment of conviction on original submission. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals granted defendant's petition for discretionary review, vacated the judgment, and remanded the cause for reconsideration of the question whether &sect; 42.07(a)(4) was unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted after calling the complainant up to 40 times an hour and leaving repeated telephone messages with the complainant's coworkers and on her answering machine. In finding that the statute was not vague as applied, the court held that a person of ordinary intelligence would have understood that the conduct proved--especially  threatening messages on the complainant's answering machine--fell within the scope of art. 42.07(a)(4)'s prohibition of harassing, annoying, embarrassing, and abusive telephone communications. Although defendant may have had other reasons for repeatedly calling the complainant as he did, there was ample evidence to support the jury's finding that he intended to harass and offend the complainant. Contrary to his argument, defendant was not found guilty because his conduct offended the complainant specifically, but because his telephone communications to the complainant were of the sort likely to harass or offend any reasonable person. Finally, defendant made no showing that his conduct was entitled to First Amendment protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant business sued appellee telephone company in the 101st District Court, Dallas County, Texas, alleging it received several facsimile advertisements sent without permission, in violation of Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. &sect; 35.47 and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). The trial court granted the telephone company summary judgment. The business appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The business sued the telephone company, alleging it sent seven to eight facsimiles to it without prior consent or invitation. The telephone company moved for summary judgment, alleging the facsimiles complied with the state statute, that the TCPA only applied to interstate facsimiles and did not apply to intrastate facsimiles, and Texas law did not recognize a cause of action for trespass to chattels. The trial court granted the telephone company's motion in its entirety. The business appealed, arguing the trial court erred in granting summary judgment. The appellate court initially noted the telephone company's advertisement did not contain complete telephone numbers for the receiver to contact the sender to discontinue the advertisement; therefore, it violated the state statute. The appellate court held the TCPA applied to interstate and intrastate facsimile advertisements, contrary to the trial court's holding. However, the appellate court concluded neither the pleadings nor the summary judgment evidence supported a finding that the telephone company commandeered the business's facsimile machines to warrant a finding of trespass to chattels.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court as to the business's trespass to chattels claim was affirmed; however, every other issue supporting summary judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The 115th Judicial District Court, Upshur County (Texas), entered a judgment that denied appellant school district's plea to the jurisdiction after appellee taxpayer sued the school district and argued that certain chapters of the Texas Education Code were unconstitutional. The school district appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A taxpayer paid taxes to the school district on three mineral properties he owned. He then filed a suit against the school district seeking a declaratory judgment that Chapters 41 and 42 of the Texas Education Code &quot;separately and together, individually and otherwise, in their operation and effect&quot; violated the Texas Constitution. The school district responded to the suit with a plea to the jurisdiction. The school district asked the court in its plea to the jurisdiction to dismiss the suit for failure to name the Texas Commissioner of Education (&quot;the commissioner&quot;) as a necessary and indispensable party to the determination of the constitutionality of Chapters 41 and 42 of the Texas Education Code. The taxpayer claimed that, based on the nature of the suit and the relief sought, the commissioner was not a necessary party. Following a hearing, the trial court denied the school district's plea to the jurisdiction. The school district timely filed an interlocutory appeal. After the appellate court considered the appeal, it found that the commissioner was an indispensable party, and the commissioner's absence deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded with instructions to enter a judgment dismissing the taxpayer's suit for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant State of Texas sought review of a decision of the District Court of Travis County, 53rd Judicial District (Texas), which granted appellee health maintenance organization (HMO) a declaration that $ 10,000 per day was the maximum penalty under Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 108.014(b), assessed a $ 1,000 penalty, and denied the State summary judgment, attorney's fees, and a permanent injunction against future violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State notified the HMO that it was liable for a maximum penalty for each day that it failed to file a Health Plan Employer Data Information Set report. The court held that the district court had jurisdiction to grant the HMO a declaration that $ 10,000 per report was the maximum penalty because the controversy was not moot and construction of Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 108.014(b) was a question of law. The State's abandonment of a per day penalty and withdrawal of the notification letter were not judicial admissions that prevented it from threatening a future excessive penalty. The court held that the State was not entitled to summary judgment because the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act waived its sovereign immunity and the district court did not abuse its discretion in assessing the minimum penalty and declining to consider the willfulness of the HMO's violation. The court found no abuse of discretion in the denial of a permanent injunction because the State failed to establish an inadequate legal remedy or irreparable injury. The court held that the district court erred in refusing to consider the State's request for attorney's fees after it recovered a civil penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment declaring the maximum penalty, granting the HMO summary judgment, dismissing the State's permanent injunction counterclaim, and assessing a penalty against the HMO. The court reversed the denial of the State's request for reasonable attorney's fees and court costs and remanded that issue for consideration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The 449th District Court of Hidalgo County, Texas, denied defendant juvenile's pre-trial application for writ of habeas corpus. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State argued that defendant's appeal was not ripe for judicial review and had to be dismissed because no trial or plea proceeding had been undertaken and no adjudication of delinquency had been rendered.

Defendant pointed to no statutory authority permitting the appellate court to consider his appeal, and there were no cases in which an appellate court had exercised jurisdiction over an appeal of an interlocutory order in a juvenile delinquency case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant patient sued appellee physician for malpractice arising from the physician's physical examination of the patient. The physician moved for summary judgment, asserting that the patient's claim was barred by the two-year statute of limitations on medical-malpractice actions, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (Supp. 2003). The 288th District Court, Bexar County, Texas, granted the physician's motion. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient's medical malpractice claims arose from two visits with her doctor in which he failed to diagnose her colon cancer. The first visit occurred on January 23, 1998. The statute of limitations on claims arising from the visit expired in January of 2000. However, she did not discover the misdiagnosis until August 7, 2002, and filed suit on October 16, 2002. She claimed the application of the statute of limitations violated the open courts provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The court determined that, because she waited several months to file suit after discovering her injury, she was not entitled to relief. The court's analysis of the patient's claims regarding the physician's negligent acts on April 6, 2000, was essentially identical. Because the patient had approximately 18 months after first learning of the alleged wrong in which to file a claim against the physician, the open courts challenge as to her April 6 claims also failed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The 232nd District Court, Harris County, Texas, convicted defendant of felony assault involving dating violence as a second offender, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.01(a)(1), (b)(2)(A) (Supp. 2010). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the term &quot;dating relationship&quot; was ambiguous as to whether it applied to same-sex relationships. The appellate court found that Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 71.0021(b) plainly applied to &quot;a relationship between individuals.&quot; The statute did not distinguish between relationships between individuals of the same sex and relationships between individuals of the opposite sex. Because &quot;dating relationships&quot; did not necessarily include sexual intercourse, there was no conflict between the Legislature's criminalization of &quot;deviate sexual intercourse,&quot; Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.06, and its protection of persons in same-sex dating relationships from domestic violence. The term &quot;dating relationship&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague in its applicability to same-sex relationships. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 71.0021(b) provided fair notice for an ordinary person to have a reasonable opportunity to know that the conduct was prohibited, and it established determinate guidelines for law enforcement. Defendant waived the issue that the statute elevating assault to a third-degree felony violated Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. Defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court's charge to the jury regarding the effect of good-conduct time on parole eligibility was unconstitutional as applied to his case.  Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

The jury was warned that the award of good conduct time could not be predicted and they should not consider the extent to which good conduct time might be awarded to defendant. Defendant did not show egregious harm. Defendant also claimed ineffective assistance of counsel. When defendant's trial counsel became aware of the existence of the murder weapon, he moved for a continuance until a ballistics test could be performed, or, in the alternative, a mistrial. There was nothing in the record to indicate that defendant's trial counsel's acts or omissions fell outside the range of reasonably competent professional assistance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty in the 183rd District Court, Harris County (Texas), of failure to register pursuant to the Texas Sex Offender Registration Program (SORP), Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 62.01-.14 (Supp. 2004-2005). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant asserted various constitutional challenges to the SORP. The court found no constitutional violation and affirmed. The evidence established that the State gave defendant notice of the duty to register. Thus, as applied to defendant, the SORP gave fair notice of the registration requirements. The SORP did not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. Furthermore, the evidence showed that law enforcement authorities followed the SORP's guideline in defendant's case pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 62.06(a), and, when defendant failed to verify his registration, he was arrested pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 62.10(a). Therefore, the court rejected defendant's claim that the SORP was unconstitutionally vague on its face. The court previously found that the SORP was civil and remedial in nature, not punitive in nature, and thus its retroactive application did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, as argued by defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant advertising company applied for and received permits from the Texas Department of Transportation for signs. The permits were renewed pursuant to 43 Tex. Admin. Code &sect; 21.154 (1999). After receiving a notice, the advertising company sought a declaration from the District Court of Travis County 261st Judicial District Court, Texas. The trial court granted the Department's motion for summary judgment. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The matter concerned the interpretation and application of an administrative rule regulating outdoor advertising signs. The Department issued an illegal sign notice to the advertising company stating that its tri-vision signs were prohibited by &sect; 21.154 and that the two locations would not be in violation as soon as the displays were changed to one advertisement per side. The advertising company stopped the rotation of the slats on both tri-vision signs in response to this notice. The question at issue was whether the administrative rule applied to &quot;tri-vision&quot; signs prior to 1999 or whether the Department of Transportation was attempting to and might apply the version of the rule as amended in 1999 to signs permitted and existing prior to 1999. The appellate court concluded that the pre-1999 version of &sect; 21.154 prohibited the operation of tri-vision signs; therefore, the advertising company was not subject to an unconstitutional retroactive application of the post-1999 version of the rule. Further, the appellate court concluded that the pre-1999 version of the rule was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a same-sex divorce case brought by appellee, one of the spouses in a Massachusetts marriage, the 302nd Judicial District Court Dallas County, Texas, held that it had subject matter jurisdiction and that Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 32(a) and Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 6.204 (limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples) violated the Equal Protection Clause. The trial court also struck relator State's petition in intervention. The State sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The reviewing court held that Texas district courts did not have subject-matter jurisdiction to hear a same-sex divorce case. Further, the Texas's laws compelling that result did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. In reaching that conclusion, the court reasoned that homosexuals were not a suspect class, persons who chose to marry persons of the same sex were not a suspect class, and the Texas laws limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples did not discriminate against a suspect class. The Texas laws limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples did not lack a rational relationship to legitimate state interests. Texas law singled out opposite-sex couples for purposes of defining a legally valid marriage in Texas, recognizing that only opposite-sex couples were naturally capable of producing children and giving those couples the option of legal formalization to promote the well-being of children. The State decided that the general welfare did not require extending the same option to members of other social units.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's order and remanded with instructions to dismiss the case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The court also conditionally granted the State's petition for writ of mandamus to correct the trial court's erroneous striking of the State's petition in intervention and vacated the amended order denying the State's plea to the jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the County Criminal Court No. 6. Dallas County, Texas, the State indicted defendant for violating Tex. Elec. Code Ann. &sect; 255.001 by circulating an anonymous flier opposing a particular candidate for public office. Defendant challenged the indictment. The trial court ruled against the State and it appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dispute began with creation and circulation of an anonymous political advertisement which described an incumbent city council candidate as a puppet. A complaint was filed, pointing out that it did not contain the name and address of the person who paid for its publication, which violated Tex. Elec. Code Ann. &sect; 255.001 and constituted a class A misdemeanor. Ultimately, the creator of the flier was indicted. He contended &sect; 255.001 was unconstitutional because it sought to regulate core political speech and was not narrowly tailored to serve an overriding state interest. The appeal focused on the conflict between the State's interest in policing its elections and an individual's right to engage in anonymous political speech.  Tex. Elec. Code Ann. &sect; 255.001 was nothing more than a deterrent and an aid to enforcement of campaign finance laws. As such, it did not justify a sweeping prohibition on anonymous political speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant county seized an automobile, on which appellee lender held a lien. The automobile was sold at auction, and the lender filed suit in an attempt to recoup its lien, alleging that the county's actions amounted to an unconstitutional taking. The county filed a plea to the jurisdiction, asserting sovereign immunity barred the suit. The Harris County Civil Court at Law No. 4 (Texas) denied the county's motion. The county appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the county argued there was no unconstitutional taking of property, as: (1) it was not required to notify the lender of the sale, Texas Transp. Code Ann. &sect; 683.012; (2) property sold at a public auction could not constitute a taking of the property; and (3) it had no intent to take the lender's property. The appellate court rejected the county's arguments. The doctrine of sovereign immunity did not shield the county from an action for compensation under the takings clauses of the Texas or United States Constitutions. The lender asserted that the county intentionally sold the automobile, while disregarding its duty to notify the lender, the sale resulted in a taking of the lender's property, and such taking was for public use. Looking at the allegations in lender's petition, taking them as true, and construing them in the light most favorable to the lender, the court held that the lender's petition stated a claim for a constitutional taking. Further, the county did not contend the lender's petition was made in bad faith.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the temporary protective order and set a hearing. Appellant did not raise a complaint in the trial court or in his motion for new trial regarding the unconstitutionality of the statutes providing for the issuance of a protective order. On appeal, he contended that Tex. Fam. Code Ann. chs. 82, 84 violated the due process of law because they did not provide for adequate notice of a complaint to enable the respondent to prepare a defense. The rule which permitted a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute for the first time on appeal applied to criminal convictions. In this case, appellant was not convicted of any crime. Appellant waived his complaints regarding Tex. Fam. Code Ann. chs. 82, 84, because he did not raise them in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate filed suit for property damage to his typewriter he alleged was caused, or permitted to occur, by the prison officials. His claim arose from an incident in which the storage box for his personal typewriter was confiscated by prison guards. The inmate attached a statement to his original petition that he had not filed any previous lawsuits. In truth, he had filed five prior suits. On appeal, the inmate argued he misunderstood the disclosure requirements of Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 14.004(a) (Vernon Supp. 2001), and did not disclose the prior lawsuits because they had been brought under federal statutes. He contended &sect; 14.004 was unconstitutional as a result of being so vague that persons of common intelligence must differ as to its application. The appeals court disagreed, concluding &sect; 14.004 was quite clear, and required a prisoner bringing any action in forma pauperis to identify and provide the operative facts of all prior suits, save those brought under the Texas Family Code. The inmate admittedly did not do so, and his misunderstanding of the statute did not render the statute unconstitutionally vague or the trial court's dismissal improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant operated an adult bookstore inside appellee city that contained adult video arcades where customers could have entered booths to watch sexually explicit videos. Appellee enacted an ordinance which required manager stations in sexually oriented businesses that contained adult arcades to have an unobstructed view of every area. Video cameras were installed in the arcade booths at appellant's store to comply with the &quot;direct line of sight&quot; provision of the ordinance. The cameras transmitted a picture of the inside of the arcade to a monitor located in the manager's station. Appellant's application for an adult arcade permit was denied by appellee. The trial court later granted appellee's motion for summary judgment. Judgment was affirmed. The court concluded appellant did not fully comply with the ordinance by installing video cameras in booths that were not open and visible from the manager's station without the use of a medium. Monitoring the arcades by video camera did not substantially comply with the ordinance, which required a direct line of sight. The ordinance was narrowly tailored to protect appellee's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment was affirmed; appellant's use of video cameras within enclosed booths showing sexually explicit adult videos did not satisfy the direct line of sight requirement contained in appellee's ordinance because it involved the use of a medium and intervening agency. The direct line of sight requirement did not improperly restrict appellant's constitutional free speech rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant petitioned for discretionary review of a judgment from the Second Court of Appeals (Texas), which, in a misdemeanor driving while intoxicated case, reversed the trial court's ruling that Bedford, Tex., Code Ord. ch. 54, art. II, &sect; 36 (2002), a noise ordinance, was void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police officers heard defendant playing loud music from his car late at night. Believing that defendant was violating the noise ordinance, they pulled him over and asked him to turn down his music. Defendant appeared to be under the influence of alcohol, and he was arrested for driving while intoxicated. He filed a motion to suppress evidence, which the trial court granted. The court held that the ordinance, which contained the word &quot;unreasonably,&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague because it was couched in terms of objective reasonableness. The ordinance contained objective criteria for determining what conduct was prohibited and therefore did not permit arbitrary enforcement. It established an objective reasonable-person standard by referring to neighboring persons of ordinary sensibilities and banning noise that unreasonably disturbed or interfered with the peace, comfort, and repose of such persons. Such objectivity prevented broad discriminatory or subjective enforcement. Although the noise ordinance allowed a degree of police judgment, it was confined to the judgment of a reasonable person. The conduct that was prohibited was sufficiently definite to satisfy due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Tarrant County District Court (Texas) convicted appellant of possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann.  &sect; 46.04. Appellant challenged the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While searching appellant's apartment pursuant to a search warrant during a narcotics investigation, police officers found a gun on appellant's person. Appellant had been previously convicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. On appeal, the instant court affirmed. Because the state legislature had a rational basis to restrict the possession of firearms inside the home with a view to prevent crime by enacting Tex. Penal Code Ann.  &sect; 46.04, appellant failed to show the statute was unconstitutional. The court overruled appellant's collateral attack of his prior felony conviction because he could only do so through an application for writ of habeas corpus. Because appellant failed to object when the State elicited testimony from an officer identifying appellant as being involved in a drug transaction in violation of a motion in limine, appellant waived the error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed because the possession of a firearm by a felony statute was constitutional, appellant could only collaterally attack his prior felony conviction through an application for writ of habeas corpus, and because appellant failed to preserve for review his contention that the State violated a motion in limine.</SPAN></P>

Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 841.001 - 841.151 (2010 &amp; Supp. 2012), did not distinguish between those anticipated to be released on parole and those anticipated to be released unconditionally; [3]-Sufficient evidence supported the inmate's commitment because a reasonable jury could find from evidence of his risk factors that he had serious difficulty controlling his behavior and was likely to commit predatory acts of sexual violence.</SPAN></P>

The 296th Judicial District Court. Collin County, Texas, revoked defendant's probation in all five cases, and refused to grant defendant credit for any time served in the SCORE and SAFPF programs as a condition of probation, and denied defendant's motion for new trial. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In defendant's motion for new trial, defense counsel stated he was challenging Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.03, &sect; 2 because the statute stated credit should be given while defendant was in jail for final sentence except for time in jail as a condition of probation. The trial court acknowledged that it was relying on article 42.03 in denying defendant credit for time he served in the SAFPF and SCORE programs. First, the appellate court noted that neither SAFPF nor the SCORE program were &quot;jail time;&quot; both programs were conditions of community supervision as an alternative to imprisonment. Thus, article 42.03 was inapplicable to defendant's claims. Second, the appellate court rejected defendant's claim that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 42.12, &sect;&sect; 18(c), and 23(b) were unconstitutional as applied, as defendant failed to challenge the constitutionality of those statutes at the trial court level.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the 24th District Court of Victoria County, Texas, of aggravated sexual assault, a first-degree felony, and indecency with a child, a second-degree felony. Defendant appealed his convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In his sole issue, defendant contended that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.07 (2005) violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. According to defendant, the statute treated individuals accused of sexual offenses differently based upon the age of the alleged victim. The court concluded that defendant's federal constitutional right to equal protection was not violated by the statute. In crafting the exemptions that were found in the statute, the legislature believed that the covered individuals might be unable to report an alleged crime to another person, because they might be easily intimidated or unable to articulate themselves, and were in need of an exemption from the timely outcry or corroboration requirement. The exemption was rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose of protecting society's young, elderly, generally more vulnerable, or handicapped individuals, who the legislature had found might be unable to report a crime to another person. After a careful analysis of the history and purpose of the statute, the court rejected defendant's argument that the statute was arbitrary and irrational in the manner in which he contended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Without first obtaining a plea agreement, defendant pled guilty to 2 counts of indecency with a child by sexual contact, 1 count of indecency with a child by exposure, and 10 counts of promotion or production of child pornography. The 71st Judicial District Court of Harrison County, Texas, assessed the maximum sentence on each count, to be run consecutively, resulting in a total sentence of 250 years' imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, defendant contended that his sentence was excessive and that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 21.24 and Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 3.03(b)(2) (2003) were unconstitutional as applied to him. The appellate court found that defense counsel's objection at the sentencing hearing that he did not believe that the trial court had a legal right to impose consecutive sentences failed to state a specific ground and did not include a constitutional complaint to the severity of the sentences; therefore, it failed to alert the trial court of the grounds of the complaint. Even if the issue had been preserved for review, and assuming that defendant's sentence was grossly disproportionate, the appellate court found that the record contained no evidence comparing the sentence with others in the same jurisdiction for the underlying offenses, or those imposed on defendants in other jurisdictions who committed similar offenses. Therefore, even if preserved, no error was shown. Further, defendant failed to provide the appellate court with anything to suggest that either Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 21.24 or Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 3.03(b)(2) (2003) were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court admitted the decedent's will to probate and appointed appellee as administratrix. Appellant contestants filed a will contest, asserting the will was invalid. The administratrix filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that all the necessary parties were not joined in the will contest within the limitations period. The County Court at Law of Walker County (Texas) granted the administratrix's motion. The contestants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The contestants alleged the will had holes physically cut in it, suggesting that some of the distributees had been cut out of the will. There was also other evidence the will may have been tampered with. The contestants asserted the trial court erred, in part, because the Texas Probate Code did not require them to join all of the will beneficiaries. The appellate court agreed. Under the unambiguous language of Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 33(a), it was not necessary to join any person as a party or give notice of probate proceedings. No provision of the Texas Probate Code expressly provided that will contestants had to join or give notice to will beneficiaries or to any other parties. Because Tex. R. Civ. P. 39 conflicted with the unambiguous language of the Texas Probate Code, it did not apply to the contestants' will contests. Finally, the appellate court did note that Texas was one of a handful of states in this country with a will-contest statute that did not require notice to interested parties and that the legislature might in the future elect to re-examine Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 33. Until then, the appellate court had to apply &sect; 33 as it was written.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court sustained the contestants' second issue, that they were not required to join all of the will beneficiaries in the will contest action, and reversed the trial court's judgment. The case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the appellate court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an insurance rate reduction case, appellants, the Texas Commissioner of Insurance and the Texas Department of Insurance (TDI), appealed the judgment of the 345th Judicial District Court, Travis County (Texas) that, inter alia, granted summary judgment to appellee insurer declaring appellants' actions void and unenforceable, vacating the rate order, and denying appellants' request to remand the case for further administrative proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants argued, inter alia, that Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 5.26-1 could be construed to operate constitutionally and that the trial court therefore erred in finding that the provision was facially unconstitutional. The court of appeals disagreed. Rather than allowing for a reasonable rate of return, art. 5.26-1 only safeguarded an insurer from rates that could lead to insolvency. While other provisions of the Texas Insurance Code comported with the constitutional prohibition on confiscatory rates, providing, for example, that rates must be &quot;just,&quot; &quot;fair,&quot; &quot;reasonable,&quot; &quot;adequate,&quot; &quot;not confiscatory,&quot; and &quot;not excessive,&quot; the commissioner was not required to apply constitutional standards when conducting an art. 5.26-1 rate review. Article 5.26-1 instead required the commissioner to approve potentially confiscatory rates, absent clear and convincing evidence that such rates would lead to insolvency. Thus, the proof provision set out in art. 5.26-1, &sect; 4 by allowing for the imposition of confiscatory rates, failed to provide regulated companies with a constitutionally adequate review of government-set rates. Therefore, the proof provision was unconstitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed as to the insurer's proof requirement and as to due process. The unconstitutional provision requiring an insurer to prove that a rate reduction by TDI would produce inadequate rates was severed. The judgment was reversed as to the constitutionality of the remainder of the statute, and the case was remanded to the department for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company sells concrete and asphalt. The company leased property outside the city's boundary and began operating a facility. Within four days of opening its facility, at least twelve truck drivers delivering concrete and asphalt to the company's plant received citations from the city for violating a city ordinance for designed truck routes. The company filed suit against the city, and the city filed a plea to the jurisdiction. The appellate court ruled that the trial court lacked jurisdiction absent irreparable injury to a vested property right. The company was not attempting to prevent enforcement of an administrative regulation or rule, but rather it was seeking a naked declaration of a penal ordinance's unconstitutionality. The company failed to establish the civil equity court's subject-matter jurisdiction because it did not identify an irreparable injury to vested property rights. Also, the city's ordinance did not ban the possession or transportation of concrete or asphalt or make the company liable for any customer transporting materials to or from its plant without a city permit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty of one count of indecency with a child by contact, and four counts of sexual assault of a child. The jury assessed punishment at 20 years confinement on each count. The State filed a motion to cumulate the sentences and the 187th Judicial District Court, Bexar County, Texas did so, ordering the sentence in count one to run consecutively with the remaining sentences for a total of 40 years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court's use of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.08 (Supp. 2004) to order consecutive sentencing deprived him of his right to have the jury assess his punishment as provided by Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 15 and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 27.02(7) (Supp. 2004). The appellate court disagreed and held that, under Texas law, the trial court had discretion to stack sentences under certain circumstances. In the case at hand, the trial court's ruling did not cause any individual sentence to exceed the applicable maximum on any particular count as each individual sentence was within the statutory limit for the crime charged. It could not be said, therefore, that the court's findings resulted in the imposition of a greater punishment than was authorized by the jury's verdict. The appellate court also rejected defendant's claim that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.08 was unconstitutional as article 42.08 did not allow sentencing in excess of the statutory maximum prescribed for each individual sentence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed his suit and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Texas Attorney General filed an amicus curiae motion to dismiss, based on defendant's failure to disclose previous pro se lawsuits as required by Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 14.004. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed his claims without prejudice. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 14 provides that a trial court may dismiss a frivolous claim. Nothing in the record suggested the trial court believed that dismissal of defendant's claims was mandatory and not discretionary. The instant court's review of the record indicated the trial court properly exercised its discretion in dismissing the case without prejudice. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 14 specifically applies to inmates, but no language in the statute suggested an inmate, appearing pro se, was held to a higher standard than an attorney. Defendant's pleadings had to comply with the procedural requirements of Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 14; he conceded they did not. Having no duty to do so, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refraining from curing defendant's pleading deficiencies. The trial court did not err in signing the order to dismiss prepared by the attorney general.</SPAN></P>

Driving a motor vehicle for personal purposes was not a constitutionally protected right; but rather, a state-granted privilege. Driving a motor vehicle was subject to reasonable regulations to protect the safety of the general public. Requiring current license plates as a condition of operating a motor vehicle was a proper subject of the State's police power. Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect; 502.407 did not violate U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant maintained a website that invited people to participate in a cycle of abundance through the giving and receiving of money.

The activity met the definition of a pyramid promotional scheme in &sect; 17.461(a)(6). Defendant's own testimony showed that participation was based on the payment and receipt of money, and it was of no consequence that the transfer of money was characterized as a gift. Defendant promoted the scheme, within the meaning of &sect; 17.461(a)(5), by attempting to induce others' participation, as defined in &sect; 17.461(a)(3), through his website and a press conference. Defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on mistake of fact under Tex.

Respondent Office of the Attorney General filed a motion to confirm child support arrearage. The 356th District Court of Hardin County, Texas, confirmed the child support arrearage and ordered the father to make monthly payments until the arrearage was paid in full.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the father contended the child support judgment was dormant and not timely revived, the trial court erred by entering the order confirming arrearage, and the retroactive validation of his child support obligation was unconstitutional. The appellate court disagreed, holding that by filing its motion to confirm child support arrearages, the Office of the Attorney General revived the judgment for the State. The two-year limitation on the ability to revive a judgment under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 31.006 (1997) did not apply to a right of action of the State.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State filed a motion to revoke defendant's deferred-adjudication community supervision for misapplication of trust funds. The trial court adjudicated defendant's guilt, sentenced him to regular community supervision, reduced his restitution payments, and waived court costs and fees. The Eleventh Court of Appeals of Texas reversed. The State petitioned for discretionary review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with misapplication of trust funds and received ten years' deferred-adjudication community supervision, a condition of which was payment of nearly $200,000 restitution. The State filed a motion to revoke, alleging defendant failed to pay the full amount of restitution. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in revoking his community supervision under former Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.037(h) (2000), because the State proved he violated a term of his community supervision. The trial court properly considered the statutory factors. The court of appeals erred by finding that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.037(h) required the trial court to weigh the factors in any particular manner. Defendant's due process rights were not violated because the trial court did not imprison him for his inability to pay; rather, he was sentenced to straight community supervision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant argued, inter alia, that the Texas Medical Practice Act, Tex. Occ. Code Ann. chs. 151-165, was void for vagueness. The court of appeals disagreed. Criminal laws must fairly warn individuals of what activity was forbidden. While appellant was licensed to practice dentistry in Texas, he was not licensed to practice medicine in Texas. As a dentist with a dental specialty, appellant was licensed to perform oral and maxillofacial surgery. The State alleged that appellant performed liposuction, tummy tucks, and breast augmentation. Each of those challenged procedures fell within the statutory definition of practicing medicine, and fell outside the statutory definition of practicing dentistry, including oral and maxillofacial surgery. The challenged surgical procedures were not strictly dentistry procedures and were not procedures appellant was licensed to perform because they were performed on regions of the body beyond the oral and maxillofacial region. The Act provided fair notice of the forbidden acts to persons of ordinary intelligence such as appellant and any law enforcement officials who might use the Act to prosecute him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed an order of the 204th Judicial District Court, Dallas County, Texas, that granted defendant's motion to quash the indictment that charged him with continuous sexual abuse against a child younger than 14 years of age during a period of at least 30 days in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.02 (Supp. 2009), arguing that the district court erred in ruling that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court held that the district court erred in concluding that the statute was unconstitutional because the statute did not violate defendant's right to a unanimous verdict under Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 13. The statute required the jury to reach a unanimous verdict upon whether defendant committed acts constituting the continuous sexual abuse of a minor but did not require the jury to unanimously agree upon which specific acts constituted that series. The State sought one conviction for a series of acts of sexual abuse with evidence that, during the relevant period, defendant committed two or more different acts--namely, indecency with a child and sexual assault--that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.02 defined as means of committing a single criminal offense and not as two or more separate criminal offenses. Further, the indictment was sufficient to afford defendant notice. Alleging the acts to have occurred &quot;on or about&quot; a specific date allowed the State to prove a date other than the one alleged in the indictment as long as the date was prior to the presentment of the indictment and within the statutory limitations period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district court order dismissing the indictment was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the Texas defense of insanity was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to him, because it resulted in cruel and unusual punishment by excluding serious mental illnesses. Defendant did not raise the constitutionality of the defense of insanity at trial. He at no time objected on the basis that the Texas insanity defense was unconstitutional, and he filed no pretrial motions challenging the constitutionality of the insanity defense. Because defendant did not preserve error, he could not complain for the first time on appeal that the Texas insanity defense was unconstitutional as applied to him. Defendant also failed to demonstrate that no set of circumstances existed under which the statute would be valid; therefore, he failed to meet his burden concerning his facial challenge.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that his verified motion for new trial required a hearing. The appellate court found that the motion set forth no facts in support of his claims that his trial counsel was ineffective or that his plea was involuntary, but instead only made conclusory allegations. Defendant's motion failed to set forth facts explaining how he was misled, what material facts were misrepresented to him, or how the applicable law was erroneously explained to him, and failed to put the trial court on notice that reasonable grounds for relief existed. The denial of the request for a hearing on the motion was proper. Defendant also failed to show that counsel's assistance was not reasonable. Defendant's claim that he was denied due process as a result of his counsel's ineffectiveness failed, because he failed to show that his trial counsel's assistance was, in fact, ineffective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The 405th District Court, Galveston County, Texas, denied petitioner citizen's request for writ of mandamus and her motion for a new trial. The citizen appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizen challenged judgment taken against her, contending the trial court erred in: (1) denying her request for a writ of mandamus; (2) overruling the writ and her new trial motion, in violation of the Texas Constitution; and (3) overruling her objections to certain exhibits based on the irrelevance of statutory history evidence. The court of appeals disagreed. The ruling denying the writ was supported by the city charter's plain language, legislative history and the 100 signature requirement. Specifically, the language was unambiguous in stating that 20 percent of the total voters who appeared on the official list of registered voters had to sign the recall petition, which did not occur. The constitutional challenge was not presented in the mandamus request, thus was not reviewable on appeal. Finally, because the language contained in the city charter was unambiguous, extrinsic evidence was inadmissible and unnecessary to aid in the court's interpretation. Even thought the court, in considering the new trial motion, gave the citizen the benefit of the doubt, she failed to present any authority in support of any ambiguity or admissibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, defendant argued that the determinate sentencing statute, as applied in his case, violated the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. V by increasing his punishment without allowing him to present the enhancement to the jury for consideration beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court found that there were no facts that changed the range of punishment. Rather, once the State decided to file a petition for determinate sentencing, the range of punishment was set. There was not an enhancement in punishment. The range of punishment did not increase based on any facts that were not presented to the jury. All the facts were presented to the jury when it decided defendant's disposition. A petition, acting as an indictment, was presented to the grand jury, all the facts were submitted to the jury, and all the facts were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. And because defendant could not serve any time in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Institutional Division, his claims were not ripe for review.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee bank sued appellant County in the County Civil Court at Law No. 4, Harris County, Texas, alleging an unconstitutional taking of a vehicle. The County appealed the trial court's denial of the County's plea to the jurisdiction. The appellate court withdrew its previous opinion and issued the present opinion in its place.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The County seized a vehicle in which the bank had a perfected security interest. The County sold the vehicle at auction after unsuccessful attempts to contact the out-of-state owner and any lienholders. The bank contacted the County after the sale informing the County of its lien. The County responded that the purchaser took the vehicle free and clear and that only $ 20 remained from the sale proceeds after expenses. The bank sued to collect the balance due on its lien, alleging that the County had unconstitutionally deprived the bank of its property rights in the vehicle without notice. The County claimed that the suit was barred by sovereign immunity because it had made a good faith effort to find the owner and lienholders before the sale. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err in denying the County's plea to the jurisdiction. The County's claim of sovereign immunity rested on unresolved contentions of fact as to whether the County acted in &quot;good faith&quot; or &quot;intended&quot; to take the vehicle. The trial court had not abused its discretion in finding that resolution of those issues should await a full hearing on the merits.</SPAN></P>

In reversing the conviction, the court held that &sect; 42.07(a)(7) was unconstitutionally vague and therefore void because it exhibited the same infirmities as an old version of the statute that had been held unconstitutional. The intent to harass, annoy, alarm, abuse, torment, or embarrass set out in &sect; 42.07(a) still did nothing to limit the vagueness originally generated by the terms annoy and alarm, and the additional terms were themselves still susceptible to uncertainties of meaning. Section 42.07(a)(7) also did not establish a clear standard for whose sensibilities had to be offended, and it was unconstitutionally vague in that the standard of conduct it specified was dependent on each complainant's sensitivity. Also, although the statute required &quot;repeated&quot; communications, it did not define the term &quot;repeated.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury for the 9th District Court, Montgomery County (Texas), found appellant individual was a repeat sexually violent offender and found that he suffered from a behavioral abnormality making him likely to engage in a predatory act of sexual violence. The trial court entered a final judgment and order of civil commitment. The individual appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The individual argued that Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. ch. 841 was unconstitutionally punitive in nature. However, because the appellate court found that the sexually violent predator statute,&nbsp;Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 841.001-.147 (2003), was facially constitutional, it overruled his first issue. In his second issue, the individual argued that his right to due process was violated when the trial court refused to submit the issue of volitional control to the jury. However, because a separate instruction on volitional control was not required, the appellate court overruled the individual's second issue. In his third issue, the individual asserted that Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. ch. 841 was unconstitutionally vague and violated the separation of powers doctrine. However, based on the precedent established in the appellate court's previous decisions, it overruled issue three. Finally, in issue four, the individual contended that requiring him to submit to polygraph examinations violated the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. However, because the individual did not assert that claim in the trial court, the appellate court did not reach it on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by the 351st District Court, Harris County (Texas), for possession of a chemical dispensing device, an aerosol can containing the pepper spray oleoresincapsicum (OC). Defendant's probation was revoked for filing a false report and adjudication of a prior offense for impersonating a public servant. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was required, as a condition of his probation, to surrender all police-related equipment and to refrain from acquiring similar equipment. Because the OC spray was of a size and concentration unavailable to the general public, defendant was charged with possession of a prohibited weapon. Defendant claimed the inventory search of his car was illegal because it was not conducted pursuant to lawful impoundment of the vehicle. Because his complaint on appeal differed from that presented to the trial court, the appellate court found the issue was not preserved for review. The appellate court held there was legally sufficient evidence that defendant was in possession of OC spray in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 46.05(a)(8) as it was illegally acquired. The appellate court admonished there was at least one sufficient ground for revocation of defendant's probation; namely, possession of the police-related items. The appellate court concluded no appeal could be taken from the determination to proceed with defendant's adjudication of guilt on the original charge of impersonating a public servant; therefore, it lacked jurisdiction to entertain that point of error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant managed an apartment building for the owner, who did not live in the State. The city building inspector testified that the apartment had received a 10-day notice that the building was not in compliance with the city building code because the building did not display a certificate of occupancy. The inspector then issued the manager two criminal citations for failure to post a certificate of occupancy and failure to apply for a certificate occupancy. The jury convicted defendant of failing to post the certificate of occupancy. The court found that the charge as read to the jury properly tracked the language of the building code ordinances and did not contain any extra or unnecessary elements that somehow created a new hybrid crime. The State had sufficiently established that defendant, as the on-site apartment manager, had primary responsibility to ensure that the required certificates were obtained. The court found that the Building Code was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad as applied to defendant. The trial court did not err when it excluded testimony of the owner's prior lawsuit with the city because the evidence was not relevant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a decision from the 405th District Court, Galveston County, Texas, which convicted him of two counts of tampering with a governmental record, in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 37.10(a)(2), (c)(2) (Supp. 2008).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant presented altered certificates purporting to show that he had completed required training courses. He was charged with tampering with governmental records. After he was convicted, this appeal was filed. In affirming, the appellate court held that the elements of an offense under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 37.10(a)(2) did not include &quot;altering&quot; the document. The offense was committed if a person made, presented, or used a false record. The phrase &quot;altering the name and date on the certificate&quot; in the indictment and jury charge served to describe the certificates. The evidence showed that defendant presented certificates with altered names and dates. Intent to defraud and knowledge of the falsity of the certificates was inferred through circumstantial evidence. Although the trial court should have given an instruction regarding the law of presumptions under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 2.05(a)(2), the failure to do so did not amount to an egregious error. The punishment imposed was not void because the required showings under &sect; 37.10(c)(2) were made; therefore, the jury was properly charged with a second-degree range of punishment. Finally, ineffectiveness of counsel was not shown.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged his murder conviction, alleging the court erred in: (1) denying his motion for new trial because one of the jurors was determined to have been absolutely disqualified from service, and (2) in refusing to reform the verdict when the jury originally returned with an unauthorized sentence. The appeals court affirmed the conviction, first reasoning that a new trial was properly denied, as the disqualification of the subjected juror was not discovered until after the verdict was entered, thus the court was correct in requiring a showing of significant harm. Further, the court determined that misdemeanor theft, the juror's conviction, was not a high crime under the disqualification statute. Appellant also contended the court erred in refusing to reform the verdict when the jury originally returned with an unauthorized sentence. Returning the jury to further deliberations was an appropriate remedy in this situation as the court could not have known the jury's true intentions. The trial court properly instructed the jury that the original verdict was void under law and that they should refer to the charge for the applicable law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Conviction was affirmed. Misdemeanor theft conviction was not a high crime disqualifying a juror from service.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that cumulation of his sentences would make him ineligible for parole until he was 92 years old, thereby violating his right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const. amend. 8 and Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 13. The court found, however, that defendant waived that argument under Tex. R. App. P. 33.1 by failing to raise it in the trial court. Even if the issue had been preserved for review, the cumulation of sentences did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The court also found that it was proper to admit an autopsy report regarding the other victim, which included details on the angle of the wound and photographs of the body. The evidence was relevant, because it tended to refute defendant's argument that someone else shot the victim. The autopsy report was highly technical and contained no inflammatory language likely to influence the jury in an irrational way, and the photographs were not unnecessarily gruesome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The 392nd Judicial District Court of Henderson County, Texas, entered a final order in a conservatorship and termination proceeding brought by the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services. The order was affirmed, and the father moved for rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In two issues, the father argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion for continuance and that the evidence was insufficient to support the termination of his parent-child relationship with his two daughters. The appellate court noted that under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 263.405, the father was required to file a statement of points on which he intended to appeal. Since the father had failed to do so, the appellate court held that it could not consider the issues the father had raised on appeal. In response to the appellate court's opinion, the father moved for rehearing, asserting, for the first time on appeal, that Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 263.405 was unconstitutional. The father's constitutional issue was not previously presented to the appellate court. The appellate court ruled that the fundamental error doctrine did not allow the father's constitutional issue to be brought on rehearing. The fact that the case involved the termination of parental rights did not automatically place that case under the auspices of fundamental error. Absent fundamental error, the appellate court was prohibited from considering the issue on rehearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the time of the incident, a valid protective order was in place to protect the victim from defendant. The protective order was issued pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code Ann. ch. 85 (2002) and defendant had received notice of the hearing in which the protective order was issued. An officer was dispatched to a disturbance call at a small motel. Defendant was charged with violating the protective order by committing assault against the victim. At trial, the victim's hearsay statements to the officer that she had had problems with defendant before the incident were admissible as spontaneous statements under Tex. R. Evid. 803(2). The prosecutor's statements during closing arguments did not constitute an impermissible comment upon defendant's failure to testify. On review, the appellate court upheld the constitutionality of Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 85.006 (2002). The statute was not unconstitutional on its face, because it satisfied due process requirements.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, defendant contended Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 20.04(d) was unconstitutionally vague as applied and unconstitutionally placed the burden of proof on him. He also claimed that the trial court erred by refusing to submit his proposed jury instruction and that use of his 1984 deferred adjudication to enhance punishment was an ex post facto violation. The appellate court found that defendant waived his vagueness argument by failing to preserve the alleged error and by failing to adequately brief the issue. He similarly waived his burden of proof challenge. The trial court did not err in refusing defendant's requested instruction as it was contrary to existing law. Further, defendant failed to produce evidence on factors critical to determining the safety of the place he released the child victim. The appellate court agreed with defendant that that use of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. &sect; 12.42(g)(1) to treat defendant's prior deferred adjudication as a conviction violated the Ex Post Facto Clause because the pre-existing deferred adjudication statute expressly provided that defendant's deferred adjudication would not be deemed a conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed as to the kidnapping offense; defendant's life sentence for aggravated sexual assault of a child was reversed and remanded for a new punishment hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sludge transporter challenged a judgment of the County Court at Law No. 1 of Hidalgo County, Texas, granting appellees, city and its franchisee, summary judgment under Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c) in the sludge transporter's action challenging Weslaco, Tx., Ordinance No. 2004-06 and seeking injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sludge transporter had contracts with at least five restaurants in the city to provide greasetrap cleaning and grease removal services. The city passed the ordinance providing for an exclusive franchise for the collection and disposal of greasetrap waste within the city and subsequently awarded the franchise to the franchisee. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred by granting appellees summary judgment because the first two sentences of Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 364.034(e) permitted an opt-out from the franchise and allowed the enforcement of franchises. The sludge transporter had a vested property in his contracts with existing customers, he was permitted to exercise its property right under &sect; 364.034(e), and the city violated that right by, in effect, reassigning the sludge transporter's business and contracts to the franchisee, who in turn rewarded the city by returning 10 percent of its proceeds to the city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee contestant filed an election contest in which he alleged various voting irregularities. The 68th Judicial District Court, Dallas County, Texas, declared the election void and ordered a new election. Appellant incumbent, who had won the election, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A general election for a city council position was held. The official canvass of the election showed the incumbent won by 16 votes. The contestant filed an election contest. The trial court found there was insufficient evidence to ascertain the true outcome of the election. The election was declared void. On appeal, the incumbent contended the trial court abused its discretion in voiding 21 early voting ballots by mail. She also contended Tex. Elec. Code Ann. &sect; 86.006(d) requiring notation of the date and time the carrier received the official carrier envelope containing the early voting ballots was directory, not mandatory. The appeals court found that because a ballot returned in violation of Tex. Elec. Code Ann. &sect; 86.006 (Vernon Supp. 2002) was prohibited from being counted, the statutory requirements of &sect; 86.006 were mandatory. Since 21 individual receipts did not show the date, hour, and address at which the carrier picked up the official carrier envelope, the 21 early voting ballots constituted illegal votes. Because the number of illegal votes was greater than the number of votes necessary to change the outcome of the election, the election was properly declared void.</SPAN></P>

Although the trial court had the consent of the State to grant the State's motion to dismiss, it had no additional authority to do so with prejudice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father, mother, and the maternal grandmother of the child had previously agreed to a trial court order granting the grandmother access to the child. The father sought to terminate the grandmother's access on the ground that circumstances had changed because the grandmother had allowed the child to be in the mother's presence in violation of the order. The father also argued that there was no longer a basis in law to allow the grandmother to have access based on the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Troxel v. Granville, which held a Washington statute regarding grandparent access unconstitutional. The trial court denied the motion on the basis that the father had waived any objection to the constitutionality of Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 153.433 (Vernon Supp. 2001) by entering into the agreement. The appellate court held that the father had not waived the right to object because the trial court had continuing jurisdiction to modify the order as appropriate. A change in the law could be a change in circumstances sufficient to justify modifying the order just as much as a factual change could.

The jury awarded the landowners damages for diminution of the market value of their properties, and both mental anguish and exemplary damages to one of the landowners. In a limited appeal, both sides sought review. The court of appeals held that: (1) the evidence was legally sufficient to establish a diminution in market value of one of the landowners' property; (2) there was no evidence to support the jury's award of mental anguish damages to one of the landowners; and (3) the award of exemplary damages was proper. As to the issues on cross-appeal, the court of appeals held that: (1) the estate did not waive its right to a directed verdict; (2) the landowners waived their right to raise the issue that strict liability should have been imposed below; (3) Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 41.008 was constitutional; and (4) &sect; 41.008 did not usurp the constitutional mandate of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother was unmarried, as was the individual. He agreed to provide his sperm so that the mother could be artificially inseminated. The parties entered into an agreement, but, after the child was born, the individual sought a decree establishing a parent-child relationship. The trial court ruled that he had standing and denied the mother's plea to the jurisdiction. The court denied the mother's petition for mandamus relief. The court held that, at a minimum, Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 160.602(a)(3) (Supp. 2004) conferred standing on a man alleging himself to be the biological father of the child in question and seeking an adjudication that he was the father of the child. The court concluded that the individual had standing under the statute, as he was a man alleging himself to be the child's biological father and seeking such an adjudication. Under the statute, the issue of a man's status as a donor under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 160.702 (2002) was to be decided at the merits stage of the litigation. Because the court only considered standing, the court did not reach the merits of the individual's allegations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant bonding company was the surety on a bail bond, on which appellant accused was the principal and the person charged with the offense. After he failed to appear, judgment nisi was entered. He was arrested three weeks later. On a final bond hearing, the County Court, Bosque County (Texas), heard evidence and arguments and then entered judgment for 25 percent of the bond amount. The bonding company appealed from that ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bonding company alleged that the trial court abused its discretion, i.e., acted &quot;arbitrarily,&quot; because it applied a fixed percentage of forfeiture in every case, rather than determining the amount to be remitted in each individual case. At the conclusion of the forfeiture hearing, the bonding company argued that the trial court should consider the bondsman's efforts to return the accused to custody, expenses incurred by the bonding company, and the hardship to the company in having to pay as much as 25 percent of the bond. Counsel for the bonding company suggested that the correct amount for the judgment was 10 percent of the face amount of the bond. The appellate court found that there was no suggestion that the forfeiture schedule was capricious or without any basis. In fact, the State argued that the schedule was historically based on an amount generally sufficient to cover the county's expenses resulting from an accused's failure to appear. Furthermore, the schedule was not applied in every instance. Thus, the appellate court could not say that the trial court abused its discretion in determining that a remittitur of all but 25 percent of the bond amount was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the felony murder statute violated federal due process because of the lack of a mens rea requirement, that it was improper to convict him of murder based on the lack of a mens rea, that the indictment should have been dismissed because he committed the offense of intoxication manslaughter which cannot be the basis of a felony murder conviction, that a death resulting from intoxication is not murder but rather intoxication manslaughter, and that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. The court found no error. Felony DWI could serve as the underlying offense in a felony murder conviction. The evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction in that a reasonable juror could have determined beyond a reasonable doubt that the act of crossing the center stripe, resulting in the collision that caused the death of an individual was an act in furtherance of the offense of felony DWI.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and the victim had a relationship for several years. After the victim established a romantic relationship with another woman, defendant made several calls to his telephone number and left multiple voice messages. Defendant was convicted of harassment. The Court of Appeals of Texas rejected her claim that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. Whether the telephone was in the victim's possession or his wife's possession was not relevant. Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.07 did not require the accused to know the identity of the person who actually possessed the telephone. The telephone calls and voice messages described by the victim and his wife could qualify as &quot;repeated&quot; as that term was used in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.07. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction, because a rational finder of fact could conclude that defendant made repeated telephone communications likely to harass, alarm, annoy, abuse, torment, embarrass, or offend the victim.</SPAN></P>

The inmate claimed he was not sent notice that a parole panel would be considering whether to release him at that time. The same thing happened in 2001 and again in 2003. The Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas granted the inmate habeas corpus relief. The inmate had a procedural due process right to fair notice of the exact date and time of the hearing.

Code &sect; 3.294(k) (2006) was valid and granted appellee comptroller summary judgment, in connection with the taxpayer's appeal to the trial court seeking a refund of taxes paid and a declaration that the rule was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer did not pay sales tax on parts purchased for the construction of a cleanroom. The comptroller ordered the payment of the tax, which the taxpayer paid under protest. The trial court declared 34 Tex. Admin. Code &sect; 3.294(k) (2006) valid and granted the comptroller summary judgment. The court affirmed. The term &quot;incidental to&quot; in Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 151.006(2) (2002) was unclear and thus the court construed the statute in favor of the taxing authority. Given that the phrase had been used interchangeably with &quot;incident to,&quot; the comptroller's interpretation of the sale-for-resale exemption was reasonable, and thus the court found that 34 Tex. Admin. Code &sect; 3.294(k) (2006) did not exceed the comptroller's rulemaking authority. Because the lease between the taxpayer and another included the lease of buildings along with a cleanroom, the taxpayer was not entitled to claim a sale-for-resale exemption under &sect; 151.006. Even if 34 Tex. Admin. Code &sect; 3.294(k) was invalid, because the company did not purchase a cleanroom for the sole purposes of subsequently leasing it, the company's purchase of the items necessary for the construction thereof did not qualify for the exemption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, four school districts, appealed from an order of the Court of Appeals for the Third District of Texas, which affirmed the trial court's dismissal of their case on the pleadings, wherein the districts contended that they, as well as other school districts, had been forced to tax at maximum rates set by statute in order to educate their students, which had become a state ad valorem tax in violation of Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1-e.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court thoroughly reviewed past judicial precedents in the area of taxation by school districts in order to meet the constitutional requirement of Tex. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1 of providing a general diffusion of knowledge for their students. The court found whether less than half of Texas school districts were taxing at the maximum rates was not the issue. Rather, even if one school district demonstrated that it lost meaningful discretion over the amount taxed by the State due to the State's control, then it was an unconstitutional ad valorem tax in violation of Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1-e. The Legislature had the authority to implement an adequate and efficient school system, but the court had the power to review it for constitutional infirmities. The court found that the pleadings were sufficient to state a valid cause of action, which was ripe for adjudication. The court also noted that the fact that some of the districts that alleged that they were at the maximum tax levels also provided a homestead exemption did not change the justiciability of the claim. The State failed to establish the districts' inability to plead a constitutional violation as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order of the appellate court and remanded the matter to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of an order from the 216th Judicial District Court, Kerr County (Texas), which convicted him of injury to a child, in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.04(a)(3) (2011).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of injury to a child, his 11-year-old son. On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred in failing to limit a jury instruction on the mens rea to the result of the conduct. However, because defendant admitted he intended to cause pain, but was doing so while imposing reasonable discipline, there was little likelihood that the conviction was based on the improper instruction. Defendant did not suffer egregious harm due to the trial court's failure to include an instruction on the parent-child defense, as provided in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 9.61(a) (2011). There was little, if any, evidence upon which a rational jury could have concluded defendant's conduct was reasonable discipline. One could hardly agree that lashing a child at least 15 times with fence wire, while the child was bound by his hands and feet for at least part of the time, and using duct tape to muffle the child's screams, was reasonable discipline to punish the child for failing to take out the garbage and for using an air conditioner and a video game without permission. Because &sect; 9.61 incorporated a reasonable person standard, it was not void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that defendant did not allege any deficiencies in the information previously recognized as cognizable on a pretrial writ of habeas corpus and that the issue of whether the illegal dumping statute required a culpable mental state was not yet ripe for review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant individual challenged a decision of the 410th District Court, Montgomery County (Texas), which ruled in favor of appellee State and granted its petition to civilly commit the individual as a sexual violent predator pursuant to Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 841.001-841.50 (2003 &amp; Supp. 2004).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that the individual suffered from a behavioral abnormality that made him likely to engage in a predatory act of sexual violence. Based on this finding, the trial court entered an order of civil commitment against the individual. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court rejected the individual's claim that Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 841.001-841.50 (2003 &amp; Supp. 2004) was unconstitutional. The court had repeatedly held that the statute was not punitive and it was not unconstitutionally vague or violated the separation of powers doctrine. The court had previously decided one issue against the individual and found no reason to revisit that decision. The court sustained the individual's issue that challenged the trial court's decision to strike his pleadings pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 215.2 and order that he be civilly committed via a default judgment. The court found no basis to justify a legal presumption of a lack of merit of the individual's defense, nor did the court find evidence of prejudice caused to the State that could not be or had not been remedied. Thus, reversal was necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury for the 78th District Court of Wichita County (Texas) found defendant guilty of possession of certain chemicals, namely pseudoephedrine, with intent to manufacture methamphetamine. Defendant then pled true to enhancement paragraphs that alleged prior convictions for burglary of a building and burglary of a vehicle, and the jury assessed a sentence of 50 years' confinement and a fine. The trial court sentenced him accordingly. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An officer stopped defendant for speeding. The officer requested that a dog handler respond to the scene. The dog indicated that he detected something inside the vehicle. A search of the inside of the vehicle revealed a partially smoked marijuana cigarette and a bag containing six cans of lighter fluid, eight lithium batteries, and 24 bottles of cold medicine containing pseudoephedrine. The officers arrested defendant. The fact that the medicine was contained in bottles that remained unopened indicated that the contents had not been changed since the manufacturer bottled them. Also, the labeling on the packages indicating that the medicine contained pseudoephedrine was sufficiently reliable to establish that the medicine did in fact contain pseudoephedrine. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the labels as substantive proof that the medicine contained pseudoephedrine. In addition, Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.124 was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant because the evidence presented was sufficient for the jury to infer that he possessed the lighter fluid, batteries, and medicine with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant became involved in a dispute with his employer's insurer and state agencies overseeing the workers' compensation system. After the dispute was not resolved in his favor, defendant made phone calls to various persons using foul and disparaging language. After he was convicted, defendant sought review. In affirming, the court determined that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.07 (2003) was not unconstitutionally vague. Next, defendant's speedy trial argument was rejected because, inter alia, he moved for a continuance six times. There was no basis for finding that he failed to receive adequate notice from the indictment. Further, defendant's confrontation and compulsory process rights were not violated. He was not denied assistance of counsel because, although he represented himself, standby counsel was appointed. His Sixth Amendment rights were not violated where subpoenas were not issued for various persons, including the President of the United States. Further, defendant did not show that the State did not comply with its discovery obligations. He was unable to challenge a finding of criminal contempt on appeal, and no harm was shown by an error in the verdict form.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The natural gas sellers sought a declaration that Tex. Util.

Code Ann. &sect; 123.024 (1997) was applicable. In the alternative, the sellers asked that the statute be found unconstitutional. The trial court granted the State's plea to the jurisdiction and dismissed the sellers' request for declaratory relief. The court affirmed, observing that litigation brought by agricultural users was pending elsewhere on the same issues and that the sellers had not established an actual or threatened injury. The sellers' pleadings did not affirmatively show that the issues they presented were ripe for review and that the failure to address those issues would constitute a hardship for them. No enforcement action by the State was imminent, and the sellers were not under threat of any sanction or penalty for noncompliance with the statute. The court noted that the necessity for the timely development of facts underlying a dispute was especially important where a party was challenging the constitutionality of a statute.</SPAN></P>

The record failed to demonstrate that defendant raised the issue in the trial court. Accordingly, the instant court concluded that he waived the issue of whether the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him. To the extent defendant's point of error could be read to raise a facial validity challenge, the instant court concluded it was inadequately briefed; defendant failed to develop his argument or support it with appropriate authority.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant's convictions did not violate the double jeopardy clause because the offenses were not the same. The court rejected defendant's contention that Tex. Fam.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant pleaded guilty to the offense of aggravated robbery and was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. Appellant challenged his conviction and sentence, arguing Tex. Code Crim. P.

The court held in order to preserve error appellant was required to make a timely objection in the trial court. Further, the court noted because Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 1.15 (1991) was not facially unconstitutional, or void ab initio, appellant was required to object in the trial court in order to preserve any error on appeal. Therefore, the court affirmed, holding appellant did not preserve his objections and that constitutional error could have been waived by a failure to object.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The County Court at Law No. 1, Collin County, Texas, granted appellee State of Texas' plea to the jurisdiction and dismissing appellants', minor and father, claims with prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Appellants had argued that the municipal court had no subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case after the minor violated Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect; 106.04. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants argued that the county court erred in denying their mandamus and request for declaratory relief. The State argued that the appellate court did not have jurisdiction because appellants' notice of appeal was untimely. The appellate court noted that appellants' motions for new trial was conditionally filed on August 19, 2005, which was timely under Tex. R. Civ. P. 329b(a) and properly extended the deadline for filing a notice of appeal. Appellants had an adequate remedy at law, and mandamus relief was improper where, because the minor's underlying trial was still pending in municipal court, she still had an adequate remedy at law. At the time appellants filed their request for declaratory relief, the minor's misdemeanor violation was still pending before the municipal court; therefore, she was not entitled to declaratory relief. Appellants did not claim that enforcement of the statutes would result in any irreparable injury; therefore, declaratory relief was improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The County Criminal Court of Appeals No. 2 of Dallas County, Texas, denied defendant's motion to suppress, and a jury found him guilty of misdemeanor driving while intoxicated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An officer stopped defendant after observing him change lanes three times without signaling his intent to turn. Defendant argued that the offense of failure to signal an intent to turn under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect; 545.104 (1999) was unconstitutionally vague and that therefore the officer lacked reasonable suspicion and probable cause to stop his vehicle, detain him, and arrest him. The reviewing court disagreed. Section 545.104 provided sufficient notice that a violation occurred when a driver failed to signal an intent to turn and was not in pari materia with Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect; 545.103. Having observed the traffic violation, the officer was authorized to stop and detain defendant. He developed a reasonable suspicion of intoxication, justifying further investigation, based on the smell alcohol and defendant's dazed appearance and admission of drinking. Those facts, together with defendant's refusal to submit to field sobriety tests and other circumstances, provided probable cause for arrest. The court also found that defendant's refusal to perform field sobriety tests was properly admitted; there was no constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State of Texas filed a petition to commit appellant as a sexually violent predator. A jury found he suffered from a behavioral abnormality making him likely to engage in a predatory act of sexual violence, and found he had serious difficulty in controlling his sexually violent behavior. The 284th District Court, Montgomery County (Texas) entered a final judgment and order of civil commitment. Appellant sought judicial review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant presented three issues on appeal. He contended that Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 841.041 violated the Texas Constitution. Since he failed to make the timely specific objection required to preserve the error for appellate review, his first issue was not preserved for appellate review. Secondly, appellant contended that Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 841.082(b) was void for vagueness because it appeared to mandate that the trial judge to transfer jurisdiction for purposes of appeal to another district court, a procedure not authorized by the Texas Constitution or the Texas Government. The present court had already considered that question and rejected it in prior cases. Finally, appellant argued the sexually violent predator statute and final judgment and order of commitment and civil commitment requirements, were unconstitutionally overly broad and vague in violation of his due process rights under the U.S. and Texas Constitutions. The argument regarding the statute had been considered and rejected by the present court in prior cases. Appellant failed to preserve his argument regarding the commitment order.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court noted that because the sex offender registration requirement was civil and remedial in nature and did not constitute punishment for constitutional purposes, it did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. The appellate court held that because the sex offender registration requirement did not constitute punishment for constitutional purposes, the requirement did not constitute an ex post facto law.

Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 19.02, 19.03, 19.06, and 1.07(a)(26) (Supp. 2006). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued the unconstitutionality of &sect; 1.07(a)(26), which defined an &quot;individual&quot; for purposes of murder as including an unborn child at any stage of gestation, and Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.06, which excluded certain conduct from the homicide chapter's applicability, including conduct committed by the mother of an unborn child. In affirming the conviction, the court found no violation of equal protection, due process, or the Establishment Clause. Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 1.07(a)(26) bore a rational relationship to the State's interest in protecting life, which did not arise only at the point of viability, and the definition of &quot;individual&quot; was not vague. The court also found that evidence of bruises on the mother when she presented at the hospital, and the resulting notification of the police, were admissible as same transaction contextual evidence. Finally, defendant was not entitled to lesser-include-offense instructions on felony murder and criminally negligent homicide because there was no evidence that defendant did not intend the babies' deaths when he stood on the mother's abdomen. The death of the babies was the purpose of his conduct, even if requested by the mother.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court noted that a prior decision by the Texas Supreme Court did not change the SVP statute or render it unconstitutional. The appellate court found that the patient pled guilty to the 1992 offense and his proffered testimony related directly to his guilt. The patient's guilt had already been determined in the prior criminal proceedings. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the patient's testimony as a collateral attack of his 1992 conviction. By failing to lodge a timely objection, the patient did not preserve the issue that the trial judge misstated the law during voir dire for appellate review, Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant pled guilty to possession of two grams of cocaine, a third-degree felony carrying a prison sentence of between two and 10 years and a maximum fine of $ 10,000. Appellant's car was valued at $ 3,000, far less than the maximum fine authorized for his offense. Also, Texas courts viewed the possession of cocaine as inherently harmful to society. After considering the relevant Bajakajianv factors, the court determined that the forfeiture of appellant's $ 3,000 car was not grossly disproportional to the third-degree felony offense of possession of two grams of cocaine and that the forfeiture therefore did not violate the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was prohibited under a Family Violence Protective Order from engaging in conduct toward his ex-wife that was reasonably likely to harass, annoy, alarm, abuse, torment, or embarrass her, and from going near her residence or place of employment. After repeated violations, defendant was convicted of violating the protective order on more than one occasion by stalking his ex-wife. On appeal, he contended that the stalking statute,&nbsp;Tex. Penal. Code Ann. &sect; 42.072(a)(1)(A) (Vernon Supp. 2002), was impermissibly vague on its face. The court, however, found that the statute gave a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what was prohibited, and established determinate guidelines for law enforcement. The court also found that the evidence, which demonstrated defendant's abusive behavior during his marriage, his obsessive behavior for over a year afterward, and his awareness of his ex-wife's actions in securing three protective orders and filing numerous complaints with the police, was sufficient to show that defendant knew or reasonably believed that his ex-wife would regard his conduct in following her as threatening her with bodily injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was sentenced to a term of life in prison after a jury convicted him of capital murder, which was committed during a robbery. After verdict, defendant filed a motion for new trial in which he alleged, inter alia, jury misconduct. The 278th District Court, Madison County, Texas, ultimately denied the motion for new trial. Defendant's subsequent appeal challenged the constitutionally of Tex. R. Evid. 606(b), as applied in this case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that, although he intentionally strangled the victim with a rope and hit him with a pipe, and knew he might thereby cause the death of the victim, he did not intend to kill the victim. Since the jury found defendant guilty of capital murder, there was an automatic sentence of life without the opportunity for a punishment phase to consider lesser punishments. In an offer of proof hearing, one of the jurors testified that, based on her mistaken belief about the necessary mental state, a belief formed during jury deliberations, she voted &quot;guilty&quot; when in fact she was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the murder &quot;intentionally.&quot; On appeal, defendant asserted the application of Rule 606(b), which prevented the trial court from considering the juror's testimony, violated his constitutional due process rights under the United States Constitution. The appeals court disagreed. It held that the public policy considerations underlying Rule 606(b) formed the foundation of its decision. Some of these considerations included the protection of the jury's right to privacy and from harassment and the encouragement of free discussion in the jury room.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the 145th Judicial District Court of Nacogdoches County, Texas, after he was convicted of possession of marijuana, and punishment was imposed in open court on November 17, 1999. Defendant had filed a motion for new trial, which was untimely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because defendant's motion for new trial was untimely, his notice of appeal was due to have been filed on or before December 17, 1999. However, defendant did not file his notice of appeal until May 14, 2004. Moreover, defendant did not file a timely motion for extension of time to file his notice of appeal as authorized by Tex. R. App. P. 26.3. On May 27, 2004, defendant informed the appellate court that he was not appealing his conviction, but sought to challenge the constitutionality of several statutes applicable to the 1999 trial court proceeding. The appellate court construed defendant's response as a notification that he would ask the appellate court for a declaratory judgment that the statutes in question were unconstitutional. The jurisdiction of a court of appeals was appellate unless the legislature conferred original jurisdiction by statute. The appellate court was not aware of any statute that conferred original jurisdiction of declaratory judgment actions to the courts of appeals nor did defendant cite any such statute. Therefore, the appellate court was without jurisdiction in the proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appeal was dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties divorced in 1990. The husband was appointed managing conservator for the parties' children in 1999 and the wife was ordered to pay $ 71,000 in attorney fees to the husband. The wife did not appeal. In 2001, in connection with the husband's action to increase the wife's child support obligation, the trial court ordered the wife to pay $ 200 a month against the against the attorney fees, with the amount increasing to $ 500 a month after the youngest child reached 18. The wife argued that the order requiring the wife to pay attorney fees was unconstitutional and that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to make the award because the husband had not specifically requested attorney fees. The appellate court held that the wife's challenge related to the validity of the original order and that raising the issue in the context of the present action constituted an impermissible collateral attack on that order. The order was, at best, voidable, and only a void judgment could be the subject of a collateral attack.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The 30th District Court of Wichita County, Texas, entered a judgment revoking defendant's community supervision, based upon a guilty plea to the offense of indecency with a child, after determining that he violated condition number 20 of his community supervision, going in, on, or within 1000 feet of a premises where children commonly gathered, and sentenced him to 10 years' confinement. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that there was no evidence that he violated condition number 20 of his community supervision, that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 13B(a)(1)(B) (Supp. 2004-05) was unconstitutionally vague, and that the statute operated as an impermissible delegation of authority to the community supervision department. The appellate court noted that the term &quot;including,&quot; as used in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 13B(a)(1)(B) (Supp. 2004-05), was a term of enlargement and it was within the province of the trial court to determine if defendant violated condition number 20 by going in, on, or within 1,000 feet of any premises where children commonly gather. The appellate court held that the record did not demonstrate, as defendant argued, that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 13B(a)(1)(B) (Supp. 2004-05) failed to give him notice of the prohibited conduct; rather, the record showed that he understood the type of conduct prohibited by his community supervision conditions. The appellate court concluded that because defendant's remaining contention concerned his original conviction, not the revocation of his community supervision, it could not address it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The restaurant argued that the trial court was without jurisdiction to relitigate the comptroller's decision, the city was collaterally estopped and barred from making a decision contrary to the comptroller's decision, and the city council's decision violated the restaurant's constitutional rights. The restaurant cited no authority for the proposition that a trial court's jurisdiction over a suit to review an administrative agency decision could be summarily divested by a later decision of a different administrative agency on a different issue. The city was not a party to the administrative action resulting in the comptroller's decision, and the restaurant failed to establish the city was in privity with any party adversarial to it in that action. There was no argument or summary judgment evidence showing that the comptroller's decision was a prior final judgment. The restaurant provided no argument or authority to support its contentions that it was unconstitutionally deprived of its certificate of occupancy. The comptroller's decision rendered more than two years after the certificate of occupancy was cancelled was clearly not a part of the record before the city council.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parents argued that their two expert reports met the statutory requirements of Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 74.351(a) (Supp. 2010). The appellate court found that one expert failed to discuss the inherent risks of a kidney transplant. The injury complained of, acquiring rabies from the donor, was not caused by the undisclosed risk of HIV or hepatitis. The expert's report failed to establish the causal link between the alleged failure to meet the standard of care and the claimed injury. The other expert failed to connect any of the donor's symptoms or possible conditions to the child's cause of death. His report failed to establish the necessary causal link between the alleged failure to meet the standard of care and the claimed injury. The child acquired a condition from the donor, rabies, that was unknown at the time of the surgery. The expert report requirement applied equally to all health care providers and rationally related to the interest of the State to prevent medical practitioners from defending frivolous claims at a high cost to the health care system. It was not unconstitutionally vague and did not violate separation of powers, Tex. Const. art. II, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with the capital murder of a child in the 24th District Court of Jackson County, Texas. He filed a petition for habeas corpus, seeking release under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 17.151, because more than ninety days had elapsed before he was indicted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's detention began when he was arrested for the offense of capital murder on July 28, 2010. However, the indictment was not returned until November 19, 2010, 114 days after his detention commenced. Because the State was not ready for trial within 90 days of the commencement of his detention, the State did not comply with the requirements of article 17.151. The court held, however, that the trial judge was not required to release defendant and, pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 17.15, could reasonably infer that community-safety concerns existed, which then allowed him to exercise his discretion in fixing defendant's bail at $ 750,000.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted in the 9th District Court, Montgomery County (Texas) of two counts of capital murder. He was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant raised various issues. The court affirmed. Because appellant never objected at trial, he waived the claim that his sentence was unconstitutional as cruel and unusual. Appellant argued that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.31 violated the separation of powers doctrine under Tex. Const. art. II, &sect; 1, but by not objecting, he failed to preserve error under Tex. R. App. P. 33.1. In any event, the court did not find that the prosecutor's election amounted to any violation. Although the paroles board was afforded the power to release inmates on parole, the determination of which inmates should be eligible for parole was a legislative function for purposes of Tex. Const. art. IV, &sect; 11(a). The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had previously held that a prosecutor did not encroach on this legislative jurisdiction when deciding how to charge someone with murder. The court held that the prosecutor will act within his authority when recommending a sentence of life without parole in a capital trial. The board had no jurisdiction during the sentencing phase of a criminal trial, and further lacked authority to prescribe whether one was to be eligible for parole based on the nature of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was placed on six years' community supervision by the 117th District Court of Nueces County, Texas, for burglary in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 30.02(a)(1) (2003). The State filed a motion to revoke, alleging that defendant had violated four conditions of his community supervision; defendant pleaded true to three violations. Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to four years' confinement. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court violated Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.07 when it failed to ask him if there was any reason his sentence should not be imposed. By a second issue, defendant contended that art. 42.07&nbsp;unconstitutionally restricted his right to allocution--in other words, that his federal due process rights were violated when he was not afforded the opportunity to personally address the court regarding his sentence, apart from testifying or otherwise presenting evidence to the court. The court did not reach either issue, holding that defendant failed to preserve them for our review. He was required to object to the trial court that he was denied his right to allocution under art. 42.07 in order to preserve that complaint for appellate review. Second, any facial challenge to the constitutionality of the statute was required to be raised in the trial court. Because defendant failed to voice any objection to the trial court regarding either issue, neither was preserved, pursuant to Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The 57th Judicial District Court, Bexar County, Texas, determined that the default judgment obtained against appellee father in a suit to establish paternity was barred as a matter of law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The grandmother contended that her suit was not barred by Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 160.007 because a direct attack on an earlier paternity finding was pending; the Texas Supreme Court relied on by the father was &quot;bad law&quot; or unconstitutional; and the grandmother could bring the lawsuit against the father as next friend. The appellate court found that the grandmother's lawsuit was barred by &sect; 160.007(a) because the statute did not permit a trial court in a later action to render a judgment that was contrary to a final judgment adjudicating a named individual to be the biological father of the child. The appellate court was bound by the authority of the supreme court case unless the Texas Supreme Court overruled or vitiated it. Although the grandmother was not a party to the divorce proceeding, the subsequent lawsuit was brought on behalf of the children. Because the children's rights were represented in the divorce proceeding, the identity of the person bringing the lawsuit on their behalf did not alter the finality of the prior adjudication or the applicability of the holding in the supreme court case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee video game owners filed a civil action against appellant State in the 70th District Court of Ector County, Texas, challenging the seizure of video games and seeking injunctive and declaratory relief. The trial court denied the State's plea to the jurisdiction and the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Law enforcement officers had seized video devices known as &quot;eight-liners&quot; and had filed gambling charges in the county court at law. The State argued that the civil district court did not have collateral jurisdiction over the owners' suit because the subject matter of the suit was evidence seized in connection with a criminal prosecution pending before another court. The trial court expressed a belief that both it and the criminal court had jurisdiction over the devices and entered an order directing the attorney general to maintain the devices safely and not to destroy the devices until further order of the court. The appellate court held that, under Texas's bifurcated criminal and civil law system, a civil court could enjoin the enforcement of a criminal statute only if the complaint attacked the constitutionality of the statute with specificity and urged that enforcement of the statute would irreparably injure vested property rights. The owners made no allegations regarding the constitutionality of the statute under which the property had been seized and therefore the trial court had no jurisdiction to enter any order relating to the seized devices.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order of the trial court was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State indicted defendant for violating Tex. Elec. Code Ann. &sect; 255.001, entitled required disclosure on political advertising, by his actions in publishing an anonymous leaflet without the required disclosure urging residents to vote against three candidates for the office of city council. Defendant filed a motion to quash the indictment, wherein he challenged the constitutionality of Tex. Elec. Code Ann. &sect; 255.001, inter alia, on grounds it violated his right to free speech. The State argued that the trial court erred in granting defendant's motion to quash, as, contrary to the trial court's order, Tex. Elec. Code Ann. &sect; 255.001 was not unconstitutional. The appellate court ruled that the trial court did not err in quashing defendant's indictment, because Tex. Elec. Code Ann. &sect; 255.001 was unconstitutional on its face. Tex. Elec. Code Ann. &sect; 255.001 was not sufficiently narrowly tailored to serve an overriding state interest without placing an undue burden on constitutionally protected political free speech.</SPAN></P>

Appellant filed suit for medical malpractice based on appellee's negligence in failing to discover the ruptured right breast implant and misinterpretation of her first mammogram. The trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court held that appellant's claim was time barred because the statute of limitations ran from the date of occurrence of the asserted malpractice, not run from the day she knew or should have known of the malpractice. Even if the open courts provision prevented the absolute two-year limitations period from applying to appellant's claims, appellant failed as a matter of law to file suit within a reasonable time after she discovered the facts giving rise to this suit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A mother challenged a decision from the 307th Judicial District Court of Gregg County, Texas, which entered an order terminating her parental rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother's child was placed in a foster home shortly after his birth. He was returned to the mother for a short period of time, but then removed again. Thereafter, the trial court entered an order terminating the mother's parental rights. This appeal followed. Specifically, the mother contended that Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 263.405 (Supp. 2007) was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment because it denied due process of law to indigent parents who were appointed new counsel on appeal. In affirming, the appellate court noted that it was required to avoid constitutional decisions unless the issues were presented with clarity, precision, and certainty. The appellate court was unable to declare a statute invalid based on a hypothetical possibility that it might have been unreasonable. The mother did not indicate how she personally was harmed by the application of &sect; 263.405, and she did not suggest that there was any appellate issue that she was prevented from raising as a result of &sect; 263.405. She also failed to show how any constitutional violation resulted in an improper judgment. Therefore, her sole complaint on appeal was hypothetical and not ripe for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner asserted that the LCRA had substantially drained the lake and that such conduct exceeded the LCRA's constitutional mandate to conserve and reclaim the State's water and violated statutory prohibitions on denying public access to the lake for recreational use. The LCRA's plea to the jurisdiction claimed governmental immunity and that the owner lacked standing. On appeal, the court affirmed. Because the owner's action sought to compel the LCRA to comply with statutory and constitutional provisions, such as Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 59, it was an ultra vires suit and could only be maintained against LCRA officials and not against the LCRA as a governmental entity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to possession of cocaine. The 377th District Court of Victoria County (Texas) imposed a suspended a prison sentence and imposed community corrections. The State later filed a motion to revoke community supervision. Defendant pled &quot;true&quot; to all of the allegations and was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment, plus a $ 2,500 fine. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.07 (2006) was unconstitutional because it abridged the due process right to personally address the trial court in mitigation of sentence. However, at the revocation hearing, defense counsel did not state that any of art. 42.07's three reasons for withholding pronouncement of sentence applied, and voiced no objection or complaint with respect to the assessment of punishment or claimed that art. 42.07 violated any constitutional right. Further, there were no post-judgment motions that included argument or authority challenging the constitutionality of art. 42.07. Nothing suggested that the trial court was aware of defendant's claim that art. 42.07 was unconstitutional because it denied his right of allocution. The appellate court held that defendant did not have a constitutional right to allocution and that the trial court's failure to follow art. 42.07 was not preserved for review when the defendant did not contend that one of the statute's three reasons applied to him. Thus, defendant forfeited this complaint on appeal. Defendant did not establish that there was fundamental error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the 183rd District Court, Harris County, Texas, which convicted him, on his guilty plea, to evading arrest using a motor vehicle, a felony offense, in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 38.04. Defendant also challenged his sentence of two years' imprisonment in a state jail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over his cause due to a faulty indictment, that his sentence was void because his indictment alleged only a misdemeanor, and that his sentence was excessive. In affirming, the court noted that the indictment alleged each element of the misdemeanor crime, but that the State intended to elevate the offense from a misdemeanor to a state jail felony by alleging one additional element, the use of a motor vehicle. The State was not required to plead and prove an absence of prior convictions under &sect; 38.04 in order to charge defendant with the felony offense of evading arrest. The punishment assessed was in agreement with the crime charged by the indictment. The indictment charged felony evading arrest, and defendant understood that he was pleading guilty to a felony offense. Because there was no evidence, nor did defendant point to any evidence, that he timely objected to the sentence, he had waived his claim that the sentence was disproportionate to the offense committed. However, even if he had preserved error, the sentence was neither cruel nor unusual because it was within the range of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.35(a).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State filed a petition seeking to involuntarily civilly commit appellant as a sexually violent predator according to Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect;&sect; 841.001-841.147 (2003). Appellant sought review of a judgment from the 284th District Court, Montgomery County, Texas, after a jury found that appellant suffered from a behavioral abnormality that made him likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant raised four issues on appeal. First, he argued that Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect;&sect; 841.001-841.147 (2003) were unconstitutional because they were punitive in nature. The court stated that it had considered and rejected similar complaints before. In issue two, appellant argued that his due process rights were violated when the trial court refused his proposed jury question on the issue of volitional control. The court overruled this issue, stating that it had recently considered and rejected a similar jury submission argument. In issue three, appellant contended that Chapter 841 was unconstitutionally vague and violated the separation of powers doctrine because of Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 841.082(a)(1), (2), (4), (5), and (9) (2003). Again, the court stated that it had considered similar arguments in prior cases and rejected them. Finally, appellant asserted that Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 841.085 (2003) and the final judgment violated the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination because the commitment order required appellant to submit to periodic polygraph examinations. The court stated that it had rejected this argument in a previous case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A minor child's father was named sole managing conservator, but left the child with intervenor grandmother. When the state sought child support from the parents, the grandmother intervened and petitioned the 30th District Court of Wichita County (Texas) to modify the original custody decree to appoint her the child's sole managing conservator. The court denied the petition and ordered the child surrendered to the father.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The grandmother contended the trial court erred by imposing requirements of proof of actual or potential harm or proof of parental unfitness in order for her to establish a right to modification of custody. The father responded that the trial court correctly retained him as sole managing conservator and that the trial court correctly concluded that the Texas modification statute,&nbsp;Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 156.101, was unconstitutional, as applied to him, under the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Considering the statute in light of the policy considerations behind it, the court of appeals concluded that the statute was not too vague or overbroad to protect the father's due process rights. The statute necessarily included consideration of parental fitness and whether a change in custody would harm the child, regardless of whether those findings were constitutionally required. Absent a directive requiring specific prerequisites for modification of conservatorship, the trial court erred and, therefore, abused its discretion in placing the burden on the grandmother to establish the father's unfitness or actual or potential harm to the child rather than the statutory elements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's order denying modification was reversed, and the case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The court found: the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction; the statute had been effectively amended to avoid any overbroad or vague results; and evidence of events occurring before the statute's effective date and on other dates than the date in the information went to the victim's state of mind, not to the elements of the offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State argued that the court of appeals erred in ruling that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 4.18 was unconstitutional. The statute placed limitations upon the courts' ability to review certain types of claims. The appellate court found that art. 4.18 went beyond simply prescribing a limitation on the right to appeal. The statute prevented a claim from being raised in any context if the statute's preservation requirements were not met. A failure to comply with the statute's requirements would prevent consideration of the claim on habeas corpus. The fact that the statute might be unconstitutional in other contexts did not make it unconstitutional as it applied to appeals. The legislature had the power to place limitations upon the right to appeal. Article 4.18 did not violate the Separation of Powers provision. The legislature could amend the traditional method for treating jurisdictional error to require an objection to preserve a particular kind of jurisdictional claim of legislative creation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a city and a purchaser, challenged a summary judgment of the 122nd District Court, Galveston County, Texas, for appellee Texas General Land Office (GLO) in appellants' declaratory judgment action alleging that Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 307.042(e) (2005) precluded GLO from assessing an annual rental payment against the purchaser because the city had never paid rent to GLO for its use and occupancy of State-owned land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The action required the court to construe &sect; 307.042(e), which enabled the city to sell a pier and hotel--property the legislature required be used for public park purposes--to the purchaser. Appellants argued the trial court erred in interpreting the statute to allow GLO to assess an annual lease payment for the purchaser's use of the State-owned tidelands, water, and bed of the Gulf of Mexico (State-owned submerged land) beneath the pier and hotel. The court held that neither the plain language nor the legislative history of &sect; 307.042(e) indicated that the legislature intended for the purchaser to enjoy rent-free use of the State-owned submerged land beneath the pier. The statutory provision contemplated that the purchaser had the right to continue to use and occupy the State-owned submerged land as a public park, in the same manner as the city had done for the past 50 years. Any consideration the purchaser had to pay for that right was a separate matter entirely. Accordingly, pursuant to &sect; 307.042(e), GLO could require the purchaser to enter into a lease, with annual rental payments, for the right to use and occupy the State-owned submerged land beneath the purchased property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann.  &sect; 143.057 was constitutional. According to appellant, &sect; 143.057 was not limited to &quot;disciplinary&quot; promotional passovers and he was entitled to appeal to an independent hearing examiner. The court held that by its clear language, &sect; 143.057(a) required notification of the right to appeal to a hearing examiner only in a letter of disciplinary action. It did not require such notification or authorize an appeal to a hearing examiner from all promotional passovers. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment on the basis that &sect; 143.057 did not permit appellant to appeal his promotional passover to a hearing examiner. Therefore, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment reversing the hearing examiner's decision awarding appellant a retroactive promotion to police lieutenant and backpay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. ch. 62.02 and 62.06, requiring convicted sex offenders to register with law enforcement, were not unconstitutionally void for vagueness, and there was no violation of the due process provisions of the U.S. Constitution and the due process and equal protection provisions of the Texas Constitution. Requiring a convicted sex offender to report more than once in a single 12 month period, by itself, did not violate defendant's federal constitutional right to due process. As defendant failed to provide separate grounds, with separate substantive analysis or argument in support of his contention as to vagueness, the court declined to address the state constitutional vagueness argument. Sex offenders were not a suspect class for equal protection purposes under Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3 and Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3A. Defendant failed to show that requiring convicted sex offenders to register yearly on their date of birth pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. ch. 62.06, even if they had previously registered within the same 12-month period pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. ch. 62.02, was not rationally related to a legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 32.49 (2003). The County Court at Law No. 2 of Collin County, Texas, dismissed appellant State's information, agreeing with the accused that &sect; 32.49 was unconstitutional because Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the State contended Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 32.49 (2003) was not unconstitutionally vague, nor did it impermissibly shift the burden of proof to the accused. The appellate court agreed, holding that the accused did not meet his burden to show the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him. The appellate court presumed, therefore, the legislature acted in a constitutionally sound fashion in passing the challenged, and presumptively constitutional, statute. Reading Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 32.49 (2003) in conjunction with Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 2.05 (Supp. 2006), the appellate court concluded the statute was neither void for vagueness nor did it shift the State's burden of proving the accused's guilt of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt. And because a rational trier of fact could make the connection permitted by the presumptions in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 32.49(b) (2003) and Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 51.901(c) (2005), respectively, the appellate court concluded that both sections were constitutional as applied to the accused.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was factually insufficient to support the jury's finding of &quot;use or display&quot; of a deadly weapon. The court of appeals disagreed. The evidence demonstrated that the metal rod had been removed from its intended purpose as part of a mop bucket apparatus. The rod was seven and a half inches long. The deputy testified that defendant pushed the rod against his throat with such force that he thought his neck had been broken and he &quot;was dead.&quot; He feared defendant would kill him if he did not fight back. The fact that photographs were taken at different times did not outweigh the deputy's testimony that he incurred the throat bruise as a result of defendant's actions. Moreover, the jury could have rationally inferred the deputy did not complain of the throat bruise to emergency room personnel because the injury to his hand caused more damage and was his primary concern. The jury could have reasonably concluded that the rod &quot;in the manner of its use or intended use was capable of causing death or serious bodily injury,&quot; but the deputy prevented such consequences by struggling with defendant.</SPAN></P>

XIV and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. In affirming, the appellate court noted that a criminal statute was presumed to be constitutional, and due process only required that the most basic procedural safeguards were observed. The United States Supreme Court had found that a similar DNA testing statute did not violate due process; moreover, the procedures in article 64.03 were similar to those provided under federal law. There was nothing fundamentally inadequate about the article 64.03 procedure for post-conviction DNA testing, and the appellate court deferred to the Texas Legislature's determinations. Finally, article 64.03 did not offend a principal of justice so deeply rooted in the traditions and conscious of the people so as to be ranked as fundamental nor did it transgress any recognized principal of fundamental fairness in operation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that his sentence was excessive and disproportionate to his crimes because the trial court failed to give appropriate weight to his mitigation evidence offered during the punishment trial. The appellate court ruled that defendant failed to preserve this issue for review. Defendant asserted that he preserved this issue for appeal by making a general objection to stacking. However, defendant's objection lacked the specificity sufficient to put the trial court on notice of any constitutional or statutory grounds for an objection, and the alleged error had been forfeited. Also, defendant did not cite any case law, other authority, or record evidence in support of his contention that the indictment underlying the action was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from two judgments of the County Court at Law No. 3, Collin County, Texas, one which acquitted her of the offense of failure to appear and one convicting her of consumption of alcohol by a minor in violation of Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect; 106.04 (2007) following a jury trial. The county court assessed her punishment at a fine of $ 75.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that it did not have jurisdiction to review the appeal acquitting defendant in the failure to appear case because the judgment was not adverse as required by Tex. R. App P. 25.2(a)(2). Additionally, because the county court assessed her punishment at a fine in the amount of $ 75, the court did not have jurisdiction to review any issues arising out of her alcohol consumption conviction other than her challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 106.04, pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 4.03 (2005). The court determined that &sect; 106.04 was not unconstitutional. It was not void for vagueness or overbroad. It was specific in its terms. It did not substantially implicate constitutionally protected conduct or speech. Also, it was not defined in such a manner that permitted arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The court rejected defendant's argument that because her offenses occurred in a private residence, their enforcement was an unconstitutional invasion of the right to privacy. Additionally, &sect; 106.04 was not unconstitutional because it is codified outside of the Texas Penal Code. The court held that &sect; 106.04 did not require a culpable mental state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">This court reclassified the appeal as an appeal of a criminal conviction. The appeal in the failure to appear case was dismissed. The court directed the clerk to change the style of the case to reflect the correct spelling of defendant's name and to identify the appeal as a criminal appeal. The county court's judgment on the alcohol charge was modified to correctly spell defendant's last name and was affirmed as modified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner owned land in the city's historic district that included a building. When the property owner demolished the building, appellees filed suit, seeking the rebuilding of the building and civil penalties and damages for violating city ordinances. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly granted the Commission's plea to the jurisdiction because the property owner failed to establish that the Commission committed a regulatory taking under Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 315.006, as neither &sect; 315.006 nor the Commission's enforcement claim actually regulated the property. The trial court also properly granted the city's plea to the jurisdiction because the property owner's inverse condemnation claim was not ripe, as there was no final decision regarding the revocation of the property owner's demolition permit and thus the city was not given the opportunity to exercise its full discretion in considering plans for the building before the property owner demolished it. Appellees were immune from liability as to the property owner's conspiracy to take claim pursuant to Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 101.057 (2005).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged the denial of his motion to quash the information charging him with violating Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann.  &sect; 365.012, and denial of his pretrial habeas corpus application, arguing that the anti-trash-dumping statute was unconstitutional for lack of a culpable mental state. The court reversed, ordering the information dismissed after considering the six Aguirre factors to determine if the legislature meant to impose strict liability. The fact that the statute was a public health and safety law, which normally impose strict liability, was diminished by the relatively minor danger posed by illegal dumping. However, the severity of the punishment imposed, which could be as high as a Class A misdemeanor bearing up to one year's confinement in jail, weighed against strict liability. The court held that a culpable mental state of at least &quot;recklessly&quot; was required, and denying appellant's habeas corpus petition was an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the contractor contended the trial court erred in dismissing its suit. The appellate court found that the supreme court had already explicitly rejected the waiver by conduct exception to sovereign immunity. Further, the instant disputes were inherently related to the provisions of the parties' contract as they related to the quality of the contractor's work; attempting to evade the reach of sovereign immunity by casting the dispute in terms of a takings claim did not change the inherent character of the contract dispute. Even if the claim was analyzed under the takings doctrine, the appellate court found that the university lacked an intent to take and the contractor consented to the university's possession of the disputed property. Thus, granting the university's plea to the jurisdiction was proper. Finally, documentary evidence the contractor attempted to admit only further established that the dispute was over the contractor's performance and rights under the contract; their exclusion did not harm the contractor and did not demonstrate that the university's conduct qualified as any unconstitutional taking of property, as the contractor contended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">According to the allegations in the petition, the patient was under the care of appellants at the hospital when he became hemodynamically unstable, and as a result of an inadequate supply of blood and oxygen, suffered injuries to his spinal cord and colon. The patient alleged that appellants' failure to investigate, identify, diagnose, and timely correct the underlying cause of his hemodynamic instability resulted in his injuries. The trial court held a hearing on the pleas to the jurisdiction/motions to dismiss. At the hearing, the only question presented was whether appellants established that the suit could have been brought against the governmental employer, the hospital. Appellants argued that they conclusively established that suit could have been brought under the Texas Tort Claims Act against their governmental employer. The appellate court ruled that the medical negligence claims were brought under the Texas Tort Claims Act. For purposes of Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 101.106(f) (2005), a tort action was brought under the Texas Tort Claims Act, regardless of whether the Texas Tort Claims Act waived immunity for such actions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty in the Criminal District Court No. 2, Dallas County, Texas, to aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. The trial court deferred adjudicating guilt, placed him on five years' probation, and assessed a $ 1000 fine. Subsequently, the trial court revoked his probation and sentenced him to three years' confinement. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued the trial court's judgment warranted modification to delete a fine that was not orally pronounced at adjudication. He further contended that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, which prohibited an appellant from challenging a trial court's determination to proceed with adjudication of guilt, violated the Texas Constitution. The appellate court initially noted defendant did not object in the trial court about the constitutionality of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12; therefore, he had not preserved his complaint on appeal. However, the appellate court held the denial of a deferred adjudication probationer's right to appeal the trial court's determination to proceed with adjudication was rationally related to a legitimate State interest and was not unconstitutional. The appellate court concluded that, under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.03, &sect; 1(a) (Vernon Supp. 2003), the trial court's judgment incorrectly included a $ 1000 fine that was not orally pronounced as part of defendant's sentence after the trial judge adjudicated guilt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed, as modified to delete the fine imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant father appealed the judgment of the 314th District Court, Harris County (Texas) that terminated his parental rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father argued, inter alia, that the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to support the trial court's finding that the children were removed for neglect. The court of appeals disagreed. A case worker stated that when officers arrived at the home at 2:15 p.m., they found the children home alone, as well as two cat litter boxes overflowing with cat feces, cat feces on a bed, a soiled mattress in the children's room, dirty dishes in the sink, and spoiled milk in the refrigerator. The children told the officers that their mother had left at 2:00 a.m., returned to leave doughnuts, and then left again. After waiting forty-five minutes for the mother, the officers left with the children. The mother arrived later at the police department and was arrested for abandonment of the children. When questioned as to her whereabouts, she told the officer that she went to the store to buy milk. However, the officer informed the case worker that there was a corner store that sold milk 300 yards from the house, and that she had not been in there. Therefore, the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support the trial court's finding that the children were removed for neglect.</SPAN></P>
