</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession with the intent to distribute heroin and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Defendant filed a pro se motion to amend, modify, reduce, or vacate his life sentence. The Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, granted defendant's motion and resentenced him to serve 30 years at hard labor. In a writ application, the State sought review of the trial court's ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced in 1986. Defendant filed his motion in 2003. The State argued that the trial court erred in vacating the defendant's life sentence and imposing a 30 year sentence as the trial court was precluded from amending the defendant's sentence at this point. The appellate court agreed and noted that under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art 881, the trial court could not amend defendant's sentence, and under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 822, defendant's sentence could not be modified. The appellate court held that in order for the trial court to be able to amend defendant's sentence, defendant would have had to move for an amendment prior to the commencement of the execution of the sentence. Likewise, a motion to modify his sentence had to be filed within 30 days of the imposition of the sentence. Further, defendant's sentence was not excessive, and therefore, not subject to correction pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 882. Defendant did have recourse however pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:574.22, in that the Louisiana Risk Review Board could review defendant's sentence to see he was eligible for parole or clemency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ruling of the trial court was reversed, the 30 year amended sentence was vacated, and the original life sentence was reinstated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;AFFIRMED IN PART &amp; REVERSED IN PART.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a husband and wife, brought premises liability and negligence claims against defendants, the city and the city sewerage and water board, when the husband hit a depression in the street and fell off of his bicycle, resulting in permanent brain damage. The Civil District Court of Orleans Parish, Louisiana, awarded the husband and wife damages for lost wages, medical expenses, and loss of consortium. The city and the board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the city and the board contended the trial court erred in finding they had previously received notice as to the road's condition and in the damages awards. The appellate court found that the record provided sufficient testimony upon which the trial court could have reasonably concluded that the city and the board had notice of the defect. However, the appellate court also found that the city, and not the board, was completely at fault for causing the unreasonable risk of harm that caused the accident and the husband's resulting injuries. As the city was liable for the husband's injuries, his recovery was limited to general damages in the amount of $ 500,000 for total bodily injury recovery in toto, as per La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5106. Considering the trauma of the accident and the husband's physical and mental suffering, the award, reduced to $ 500,000 under the cap, did not shock the conscience. The trial court's award for future lost wages and earning capacity was not an abuse of discretion, as it was more probable than not that, but for the accident, the husband would have pursued his education to obtain additional advanced degrees resulting in higher salaries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed as to the board's liability, and the board and the husband were found not to be at fault. The general damages award was amended and reduced, and the wife's award for loss of consortium was reversed. Otherwise, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Louisiana Supreme Court remanded the writ application filed by defendant, the State of Louisiana, through the Department of Public Safety and Corrections (department) after plaintiff inmate filed a personal injury action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate filed a personal injury action against the department for injuries he sustained, including a potentially fatal kidney disease. The department filed a dilatory exception raising the objection of prematurity, asserting that the inmate failed to exhaust administrative remedies, as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:1172 and 15:1184. The trial court denied both exceptions, and the department filed a writ application. The merits of the application were denied by the appellate court, and the supreme court later remanded the matter to the appellate court. The appellate court once again denied the department's exceptions, holding that retroactive application of 2002 La. Acts 89 (Act 89) to the inmate's tort action would have unconstitutionally disturbed his vested rights. The inmate was not required to comply with the unconstitutional procedure that existed prior to Act 89. Thus, his tort action was not filed prematurely. Additionally, the inmate's petition was not vague or ambiguous because it did not provide an administrative procedure number.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claiming that appellant department of corrections was negligent, appellee injured inmate sought to recover damages, including medical bills, future medical expenses, and general damages for pain and suffering. The department filed dilatory exceptions, raising the objection of prematurity. The 18th Judicial District Court, Parish of Iberville (Louisiana), denied the department's exceptions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of Louisiana remanded the matter to the appellate court for briefing, argument, and opinion. The department urged that the inmate failed to exhaust her administrative remedies as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1172 of the Louisiana Corrections Administrative Remedy Procedure (CARP), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1171-1179, and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:1184 and 15:1191 of the Louisiana Prison Litigation Reform Act (LPLRA), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1181-1191. The inmate claimed she was entitled to proceed with the trial court proceeding based on the holding of Pope v. State. The inmate initiated her request for an administrative remedy within 90 days of the alleged accident. The appellate court found that retroactive application of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1172 was not permissible based on the facts of the instant case. The administrative regulations in place prior to the enactment of 2002 La. Acts 89 were unenforceable, because they implemented legislation that was found unconstitutional in Pope. Accordingly, the department had not sustained its burden of establishing an available administrative remedy. The trial court did not err in denying the exception.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of distribution of heroin, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(A). The 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Division &quot;M&quot; (Louisiana) denied defendant's motion to exclude certain tape recorded conversations and denied his motions for new trial and post-verdict judgment of acquittal. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without benefit of probation or suspension. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, defendant argued that the evidence presented at trial was legally insufficient to support his conviction because the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he acted with co-defendant to deliver the heroin to the informant. While defendant was not directly involved in the transaction, the evidence reflected that he facilitated the transaction and procured co-defendant to deliver the heroin. According to co-defendant, defendant described the precise location of the heroin and even described how it would be packaged. After speaking to defendant, co-defendant went to the location, picked up the heroin and delivered it to the informant in exchange for $ 350. Further, defendant was seen driving a vehicle near the building prior to and during the transaction. Although defendant contended that his co-defendant's testimony was not believable, the jury obviously found otherwise. The appellate court found that the evidence was sufficient for rational jurors, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was a principal to distribution of heroin. The assignment of error was without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to six counts of carnal knowledge of a juvenile under the age of 17, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:80. The Fortieth Judicial District Court for the Parish of St. John the Baptist, Louisiana, sentenced defendant to 10-years at hard labor on each of the six counts with each sentence to run concurrently.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plea agreement did not contain an agreed-upon sentence, and only indicated defendant would be sentenced, with no sentencing cap, after a pre-sentence investigation report. Defendant admitted he had sexual intercourse with the 13-year-old victim on six separate occasions over a two-month period. Defendant argued that the imposed sentences were unconstitutionally excessive, and that the failure of trial counsel to file a motion to reconsider constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Since defendant sought a review of his sentences solely for constitutional excessiveness, his trial counsel's failure to move for reconsideration was inconsequential and his ineffective assistance claim had no merit. Furthermore, there was no abuse of discretion in the sentences imposed. Defendant had a previous conviction for carnal knowledge of a juvenile, and was on probation for the same offense at the time he committed the present six offenses. Defendant, at the age of 22, had over 20 adult arrests ranging from simple robbery and simple assault to attempted armed robbery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant homeowners brought a suit against appellee neighboring business and a town, claiming that the business blocked their right of way and that the correct procedures had not been followed in changing the zoning of the lot owned by the business. The 23rd Judicial District Court, Parish of St. James, Division &quot;E&quot; (Louisiana), prohibited the right-of-way from being blocked and dismissed the rest of the case. The landowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners, inter alia, claimed that the trial court erred in finding that the town's zoning map and ordinance were properly enacted. They alleged that the published notices were deceptive and misleading, because the board of alderman voted immediately after the meeting to adopt the ordinance, rather than waiting three days for written comments, and because no notice of the agenda for the meeting was published. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:4724 and the town's zoning plan required a public hearing be held prior to adoption or amendment of zoning regulations, and the meeting duly noticed. There was no requirement to hold open adoption of the amendments for three days, and the appellate court did not find that the notice so implied. There was evidence at the trial that receipt of any such comments in the three-day period could have brought the matter back before the board. There were no written comments or objections within the time frame allowed. Strict compliance with the zoning laws did not require the town to wait until the three day period had passed before adopting the ordinances. The town complied with the statutory law requiring notice and the opportunity for a public hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. The homeowners were taxed the costs of the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to sexual battery in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:43.1. The 17th Judicial District Court, in and for the Parish of Lafourche (Louisiana) sentenced defendant to five years at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant claimed that his sentence was excessive. The State argued that review of defendant's assignment of error was barred by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881.2 A(2). The court agreed with the State that the existence of a plea agreement was set forth in the record at the time of defendant's plea. However, that plea agreement was not set forth in the record with any particularity. Without specific reference to an agreed-upon sentence in the record at the time of the plea, Art. 881.2 A(2) did not bar appellate review of the sentence imposed. After considering defendant's argument, the court affirmed. A review of the record revealed that the trial court adequately considered the criteria of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 B(2) and did not manifestly abuse its discretion in imposing the sentence herein. The sentence imposed was not grossly disproportionate to the severity of the offense, given that defendant had sexual contact with a victim younger than 15 years of age and more than three years younger than defendant. Therefore, the sentence was not constitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Nineteenth Judicial District Court, in and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, granted judgment in favor of appellee towing company owner, finding that numerous Louisiana statutes regulating the towing/storage industry, as well as regulations promulgated pursuant to those statutes, were preempted by federal law. Appellant State Police appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the rules and regulations attacked by the towing company were not preempted by 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 14501(c), but fell under Louisiana's safety regulatory authority and were thus saved from preemption. The appellate court found that the subject statutes and regulations found to be preempted by the trial court came within the safety exemption of &sect; 14501(c). The ban on solicitation of towing business by tow truck operators, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:1714(2), was designed to protect the public from the safety hazards associated with wreck-chasing. The provision requiring that tow operators wear clothing sufficient to identify the towing company and driver was clearly related to the efficient administration of accident scenes and was designed to make the towing and removal of vehicles safer. Requiring oil-absorbent materials, such as sand or oil, to be protected from the elements, was clearly related to vehicle safety and was thus saved from preemption under the safety exemption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police jury had argued that the parish was entitled to the revenue derived from video poker machines located in Acadia Parish and also within the municipal limits of the town. The police jury argued that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:171 was unconstitutional because there was no rationale basis for distinguishing between municipalities located wholly within the physical boundaries of one parish and those municipalities whose boundaries encompassed more than one parish. The police jury asserted that it defeated the legislative purpose behind La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:171(B), which was to protect the integrity of the local option vote in each parish and prevent a municipality located wholly within a parish that voted to prohibit video poker from changing its eligibility to receive revenue through the annexation of portions of a parish that voted to allow video poker. The appellate court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:171(B) did not create any unreasonable classifications, and was a legitimate exercise of the legislature's constitutional power to except municipalities which were located in two parishes from the prohibition contained in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:171(B).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a legal malpractice case, the Fifteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Lafayette, Louisiana, denied plaintiffs', family members, motion for new trial after finding that defendants, law firm and lawyer, did not deviate from the standard of care in a meeting between the family members and defendant relatives. The family members appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The family members attacked the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5605, arguing that its application prevented the jury from hearing the evidence that the law firm had been involved in representing the family in developing a real estate project from the beginning. The appellate court found that the members' legal malpractice case was premised on the lawyer's failure to document the tentative agreement reached at a meeting; however, this failure did not automatically require the jury to find that the lawyer had committed legal malpractice. The record in no way supported the allegation that the lawyer's failure to document the tentative agreement was a legal cause of the members' loss. One brother testified that he would not have signed the agreement that night without first checking with his wife, who was a co-owner with him in the business venture. His wife was adamant that the agreement would not be acceptable to her and her husband.</SPAN></P>

The inmate then filed this action and alleged that La. Const. art. V, &sect; 26(B) and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 16:1(B) were unconstitutional as they conflicted with the United States Constitution and that there was an unconstitutional delegation of power to the district attorney's office to prosecute cases on the State's behalf. The trial court granted the district attorney's exceptions of no cause of action and no right of action. The appellate court affirmed and held that there was no cause of action as the inmate's pleading presented no existing, actual and substantial dispute for which declaratory judgment would be appropriate. No resolution of a justiciable controversy could possibly be served by a declaratory judgment in the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being found guilty in the Thirty-Third Judicial District Court, Allen Parish (Louisiana), of distribution of a controlled dangerous substance, Schedule II, cocaine, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(A)(1), defendant's motion for a new trial was denied. Defendant was sentenced to 25 years at hard labor. Defendant's motion to reconsider his sentence was denied. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that: (1) the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict; and (2) his sentence was constitutionally excessive. Defendant could not complain of errors after the verdict unless he objected to the errors at the time of the ruling. A review of the trial transcript revealed that defendant did not object to the admission of the drugs or the video tapes showing the drug transaction. Thus, the instant court could not address the issue of whether the trial court improperly admitted into evidence the drugs, the video tapes of the drug transaction showing defendant exchanging two rocks of crack cocaine for $ 40, and the confidential informant's testimony. The evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. On the issue of excessiveness of the sentence, it was not whether another sentence would have been more appropriate, but whether the trial court abused its discretion. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(B)(1) provided for a term of imprisonment of not less than two years nor more than 30 years.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee couple asserted causes of action in strict liability as well as negligence and sought a judgment that the Blood Shield Statutes were not applicable to the couple's strict liability claims against appellant hospital for the distribution of alleged contaminated blood products received by the wife in 1984. The Judicial District Court (Louisiana) rendered a judgment granting their motion for partial summary judgment. The hospital appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties agreed that the law in effect in 1984 when the blood transfusion took place was the law that governed the case. While there was no dispute that the hospital was a distributor of blood, the parties disagreed on whether the strict liability prohibition contained in the Blood Shield Statutes, former La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2797 and former La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2322.1, in effect in 1984 applied to distributors of blood. The appellate court held that the 1982 statute did not expressly make a distinction between hospitals that actually provided blood from their own blood banks and hospitals that obtained blood from other hospital blood banks. Therefore, the district court erred in concluding that, as of 1984, when the wife's transfusion was received, strict liability applied. The language of the 1982 statute clearly showed the legislature's intention to shield, inter alia, hospitals and hospital blood banks from claims of strict liability or liability of any kind without negligence in the screening, processing, transfusion, or medical use of human blood and blood components resulting in transmission of viral disease undetectable by medical and scientific laboratory tests.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The writ was granted, and the judgment of the trial court granting the motion for partial summary judgment in favor of the couple was vacated.</SPAN></P>

The property actually belonged to appellee property owner, who after unsuccessful attempts to serve the drilling company, had the rig seized and sold at a sheriff's sale. In a declaratory action, the Twenty-Sixth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Webster, Louisiana, upheld the sale. The drilling company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A bank intervened as the holder of a chattel mortgage, asserting that its chattel mortgage was secured by the same drilling rig, and that the chattel mortgage was properly filed. The bank subsequently assigned its security interest to substituted intervenor petroleum company. The sole issue on appeal was the validity of the sheriff's sale. The trial court had held that the bank, knowing the mobile nature of the portable drilling rig, had a duty to take steps to have the mortgage filed in the parishes in which it was located in order to put third parties on notice. Since the bank did not take steps to record its mortgage in the parishes in which the rig was located, the trial court held that, as a mortgagee, the bank was not reasonably identifiable to third parties in other parishes, such as the property owner. The appellate court found that the equipment seized and sold at the sheriff's sale was substantially different from that listed in the chattel mortgage. Further, the location of the chattel as specified in the chattel mortgage was incorrect, precluding notice to third parties. Therefore the chattel mortgage could not be enforced against the property sold.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. Costs were assessed to the drilling company and the petroleum company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff electric cooperative customers filed a petition for refund of state sales taxes with the board of tax appeals against defendant department of revenue; the customers also filed a class action suit seeking virtually the same relief. The 19th Judicial District Court of East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, denied the department's exceptions. On review, the department was granted writs, and the case was remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its exceptions, the department characterized the customers' claims as being brought pursuant to the Louisiana Overpayment Refund procedure, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1621 et seq. The customers' opposed the declinatory exception on the grounds that the trial court had original jurisdiction of all civil matters under La. Const. art. V, &sect; 16(A). The instant court found that the law did not afford the customers a remedy under civil code theories of recovery; thus, the board's jurisdiction was not circumscribed by &sect; 16(A) and the trial court's jurisdiction vis-a-vis the board was properly governed by La. Const. art. V, &sect; 16(B). As such, the instant court held that the trial court lacked original jurisdiction to consider the merits of the customers' claims. The instant court could not properly consider the customers' constitutional issues until the trial court had definitively ruled on them, as the validity of the claim procedure and the merits of the department's prescription defense were intertwined with the issue of the constitutionality of the challenged statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">That portion of the judgment denying the objection of lack of subject matter jurisdiction was reversed. That portion of the judgment denying the peremptory exception of prescription was vacated. The customers' cause of action for judicial review of their causes of action and claims for refund of the sales tax overpayments was remanded, but stayed pending the conclusion of the administrative proceeding before the department and the board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient sued the doctor for misdiagnosing a mole as not being skin cancer. The doctor filed an exception of prescription, in which he alleged that the complaint was filed beyond the three year prescriptive period designated in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628. The patient averred that the condition from which she suffered had a latency period of more than three years, and urged that the Louisiana Supreme Court noted in dicta that in such cases, the prescriptive period may be unconstitutional. As the instant court read the record, it was apparent that the trial court determined the constitutional issue presented by the patient at the trial on the exception of prescription, and, as it granted the exception, it effectively denied the request for declaratory judgment. While the patient did raise the issue in a motion, it was tried as an opposition, the attorney general was not notified as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4448, and no hearing was had on the motion itself. The trial court thus erred in considering the claim of unconstitutionality, and to the extent that it determined the constitutional claim, its ruling, on that issue alone, was vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment granting the doctor's exception of prescription was set aside. The matter was remanded to allow the patient an opportunity to properly litigate her constitutional challenge.</SPAN></P>

The statute and codal provisions pertinent to the instant case were declared unconstitutional in the Louisiana Supreme Court decision solely because they were local laws in violation of La.

The district court also granted appellees, intervenors', motion to intervene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case involved an action for declaratory and injunctive relief seeking to enforce restrictive covenants prohibiting commercial use of the properties fronting one of the premiere residential neighborhoods in New Orleans. The residents fronting the area in question filed an action against the corporation, and the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the residents. The trial court affirmed, stating that, based on the analysis of the three pertinent documents, the two contractual agreements, the 1931 Act and the 1977 Agreement, and the 1990 decision interpreting those agreements, the parties intended to create building restrictions, La. Civ. Code Ann. arts. 781 and 782. The court thus classified the restrictions as building restrictions. Because building restrictions constituted real property rights on property, the only way in which the restrictions could have been amended before the expiration of the fixed term of April 18, 2027, was with the consent of all of the landowners. The court reversed the granting of the intervention, because the restrictions were at the heart of the action and the intervenors were strangers to those restrictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff reception hall and restaurant owner appealed from a summary judgment granted by the 29th Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Charles, Division &quot;D&quot; (Louisiana) to appellee parish in the restaurant owner's suit against the parish for denying the restaurant an outdoor liquor permit after he had already been in business for sometime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The restaurant owner contended, inter alia, that he was denied his constitutional rights of due process of law and equal protection and was deprived of property without just compensation because the ordinance was amended without notice to him. Although the denial of the permit affected the scope of his business, the ordinance did not affect his right to conduct either a restaurant business or a reception business. His right to provide alcoholic beverages inside was not revoked by the ordinance. The ordinance was merely economic or social regulation, thus there needed only to have been a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest. The restriction on alcohol outdoors had a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest, which was to regulate noise nuisance. The council concluded that removing the exemption for restaurants was the best way to regulate the noise caused by loud music at outside parties. Since the ordinance did not: (1) affect a fundamental right; (2) constitute arbitrary and unreasonable action; and (3) was rationally related to a legitimate government interest, it did not violate the federal or the state's due process protections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. Costs of the appeal were to be paid by the restaurant owner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant received an enhanced sentence after the trial court found that he had committed a prior felony. In reviewing the record in the first appeal, the court had recognized that an illegal sentence had been imposed. The sentence was vacated and the case was remanded. The trial court reduced the original enhanced sentence by five years and defendant again appealed. In the second appeal he asserted that the trial court erred in finding him to be a second-felony offender and that his new sentence was excessive. The court refused to address the first issue because the issue had been decided in the prior appeal. Review of the second issue was limited to a review for constitutional excessiveness because no motion to reconsider the sentence had been presented to the trial court. The court affirmed. The sentence imposed was the mandatory minimum sentence for defendant's offense at the time it was committed. It was presumed to be constitutional. Defendant failed to present any evidence that the sentence was unconstitutional. The sentence was mandatory and defendant failed to show that it was grossly out of proportion to the severity of his crime.</SPAN></P>

Defendant stated he understood the sentences, signing a waiver of rights included a statement of the same. Based on the foregoing, defendant was not entitled to appellate review of his sentence. The proper recourse for defendant was to move the court to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea. But, he failed to do so.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of raping a seven-year old child. On appeal, his main contentions were that there was insufficient evidence of penile penetration and that his sentence was excessive. Defendant was 16 years old at the time of the rape. The court affirmed. While there were some conflicts in the evidence, it was sufficient to support defendant's conviction. The victim, testifying in terms she used to describe genitals and other body areas, testified that defendant attempted to stick his penis inside her. The victim made similar statements to doctors and a child advocate. Physical examinations by the doctors indicated penetration. And the victim testified that defendant was the only one who had touched her in an inappropriate manner. The life sentence was mandatory under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42. Departure from the minimum sentence was available only in rare circumstances where a trial court felt the sentence would violate La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. Defendant failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that circumstances existed that warranted a departure from the minimum sentence. Thus, the sentence was not constitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence, the Second Judicial District Court for the Parish of Bienville, Louisiana, convicted him of second-degree murder and sentenced him to the mandatory term of life imprisonment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying his motions to suppress and for mistrial. The appellate court found that the testimony and physical evidence were sufficient for a rational jury to find that defendant had the specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm when he fired his weapon at the victim's head. Although defendant's self-serving statement was that he shot the victim in self-defense, the jury chose to reject this version of the shooting, which it was entitled to do. As defendant had no right to an expectation of privacy in the abandoned house, and, as probable cause for the search existed, the search was not unlawful, and defendant's statement was not subject to suppression. While questions the prosecutor asked an expert regarding the gunshot wounds were improper, denial of defendant's motion to mistrial was proper, considering the trial court's strong admonition to disregard. Defendant's sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive, as it was statutorily required; defendant failed to articulate why his circumstances justified an exception to the imposition of the mandatory life sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A restraining order required plaintiff individual's wife to leave the home. Defendants, two city police officers, escorted the wife to the home to retrieve personal items. The individual sued the officers, alleging they deprived him of his constitutional right to be free of unreasonable search and seizure. The Twenty-Third Judicial District Court, Parish of St. James, Louisiana, granted summary judgment for the officers. The individual appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual and his wife were going through a divorce. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46:2135(C) provided that during the existence of a temporary restraining order, a party had the right to return to the family residence once, to recover his or her personal necessities, provided that the party was accompanied by a law enforcement officer. However, the individual asserted that under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, the alleged violation of his Fourth Amendment rights took place with the entry of one officer into his home without a warrant, and that there was a &quot;seizure&quot; of his person when the officer instructed him to sit on the sofa while his wife gathered her belongings. The appellate court agreed with the trial court's findings that nothing in the record indicated the officers threatened or touched the individual or removed anything from his house. The officers were on the premises for approximately 10 minutes, and were authorized by their department to provide the assistance rendered for defendant's wife for the limited purpose of obtaining her clothing and personal items. Thus, there was not an unconstitutional seizure on the individual.</SPAN></P>

His original sentence of five years at hard labor was vacated because he failed to appear and he was resentenced as a multiple offender to seven years at hard labor. He appeal, but the court affirmed, stating that defendant was sufficiently advised of his rights and made a knowing and intelligent waiver of those rights. Throughout the colloquy, the trial court asked defendant if he understood his rights and the fact that he was giving them up by pleading guilty to which defendant consistently responded, &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; The trial court also specifically inquired into the waiver of rights form. Defendant acknowledged that he had read and signed the form, which specifically advised defendant of his three Boykin rights. The court further granted his counsel's motion to withdraw, holding that there were no errors or issues, which if raised, would have arguable supported an appeal. The court concluded that the record showed that the trial court fully complied with La. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), which convicted him of armed robbery, in violation of La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64 and he appealed both his conviction and sentence. The court affirmed however, stating that the evidence was not insufficient to convict him, because the convictions essentially rested on his identification by the victims in each case. In a case where there was no physical evidence to link a defendant to the crime charged, the testimony of one witness, if believed by the trier of fact, was sufficient support for a factual conclusion required for a verdict of guilty. Further, defendant was not prejudiced by the State's comments in its opening statement, because defendant did not allege or prove bad faith on the part of the prosecution, and the court found that there was no clear or substantial prejudice to him. There was sufficient evidence to connect defendant with the crime independent of any inference in the opening statement. Defendant had no constitutionally guaranteed right to the assistance of counsel at the physical lineup, because it was held prior to his indictment. Defendant was precluded from raising an appeal with regard to a juror, because he did not object prior.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967C. Defendant was adjudicated a fourth felony offender and given the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment at hard labor without benefits. After the First Judicial District Court, Parish of Caddo (Louisiana), denied defendant's motion to reconsider the sentence, defendant appealed his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the term was disproportionate to the severity of the offense and excessive due to his disabilities and the non-violent nature of his prior offenses. The appellate court found that the trial court could have considered the legislative change in policy brought about by the 2001 amendment to the Habitual Offender Law, but rejected defendant's argument regarding the direct application of the new law to his sentencing. As defendant had only one 10-year drug offense, which was his oldest and not his latest offense, the leniency of the new law indicated that such an offender, after June 15, 2001, should have been sentenced under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1)(c)(i) to a term ranging from 20 years at hard labor to life imprisonment. A trial court could take into consideration such leniency, as reflected in the legislature's new policy, and had the duty to reduce a sentence to one that would not have been excessive in view of the specific facts regarding the prior offenses and the fact that the legislature amended the Habitual Offender Law to provide more lenient punishment for drug offenders such as defendant who committed crimes after June 15, 2001.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence was vacated, and the case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was hired by the DWF as a wildlife educator supervisor. She served as a wildlife educator supervisor under a probationary appointment. She was separated from employment when she failed to obtain permanent status after a 12-month probationary period. Subsequently, she filed claims of sexual discrimination and/or sexual harassment. The appellate court found that the alleged sexual discrimination and harassment claims alleged in the employee's petition were not included in the parameters of the jurisdiction afforded to the Louisiana Civil Service Commission. Thus, she properly filed her suit in district court. Additionally, the trial court improperly granted the DWF and the supervisor's motion for summary judgment because there was evidence that the supervisor engaged in sexual harassment because (1) the supervisor's rude behavior was directed much less frequently toward the men than toward the women at the DWF; (2) in a training session on handguns, all the females were singled out and excluded while the men were permitted to attend and participate; and (3) and the supervisor had a propensity to remark about the size and appearance of female employees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers learned that a package containing a controlled substance was being shipped to defendant's address.

A search warrant was executed and drugs were found in defendant's house. Defendant was subsequently charged and convicted of drug offenses. The court affirmed on appeal. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's possession of cocaine conviction in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(F). The kilogram of cocaine was found inside a videocassette recorder in defendant's bathroom closet. The police also seized 29 bags of crack cocaine, a digital scale, and other drug-related items. The State established that the cocaine was subject to defendant's dominion and control. Defendant's guilt could have been inferred from the circumstances. Defendant's two 30-year concurrent sentences were not constitutionally excessive in violation of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The trial court properly considered the presentence investigation report and the facts. Defendant failed to show that he was entitled to a downward departure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Louisiana Board of Tax Appeals vacated a portion of the additional sales tax assessment by defendant, the Louisiana Department of Revenue, set aside the penalty imposed, and ordered a refund of the payment made on that portion of the assessment. The Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Division &quot;I&quot; (Louisiana), reversed the part of the Board's ruling that was in favor of plaintiff taxpayer. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department began a sales tax audit of the taxpayer. The controller of the taxpayer signed a Department-supplied form that waived prescription for the tax period January 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993. Subsequently, the chief executive officer (CEO) signed a waiver of prescription for 1994. The taxpayer filed a petition with the Board asserting that the waivers of prescription signed by the controller and the CEO were invalid because they were made without authorization by the board of directors. Although most of the facts were stipulated, there was no stipulation of fact as to the issues of the apparent authority of the controller and the CEO and the alleged ratification by the CEO of the controller's waiver. Because the controller was only an employee of the taxpayer and had no apparent authority to act for the taxpayer, the 1993 prescription waiver was not valid and the additional sales tax assessment for 1993 was improper. However, the CEO had apparent authority to act for the taxpayer; thus, the waiver of prescription of the 1994 taxes was effective. Finally, the Board did not exceed its authority in ordering a refund of the overpayment.</SPAN></P>

App. LEXIS 3234 (La.App. 1 Cir., Nov. 7, 2003)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;AFFIRMED; ANSWER TO APPEAL DENIED.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mayor and city failed to issue a paycheck to appellee newly-elected city court judge. The judge filed suit seeking an alternative writ of mandamus directing the mayor to issue the judge's paycheck. The 19th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), ordered that the writ of mandamus be made peremptory and ordered that the mayor pay attorney fees. The mayor and city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge argued that his failure to sign the personnel action form would only have served as acquiescence to an incorrect salary. The appellate court held that the judge's cause of action arose when his first paycheck was withheld. The trial court properly overruled the exception raising the objection of prematurity. The primary issue was whether or not the trial court properly granted the extraordinary remedy of mandamus. As the chief executive officer of the city, the mayor had to execute the ordinances as passed by the city council. The appellate court concluded that the mayor was obligated to compensate the judge in accordance with the city ordinance. Because the mayor failed to comply with the terms of the city charter and with the mandate of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:2488.27 that the judge's salary was to be fixed by the council, the judge's only available avenue of relief in the case at bar was by mandamus proceeding. Thus, the appellate court found no error in the trial court's judgment ordering that the writ of mandamus be made peremptory. It necessarily followed that the mayor's dilatory exception to the unauthorized use of summary proceedings was without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. Appeal costs in the amount of $ 1,724 were assessed against the mayor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was employed at a group home; the victim was a 12 year old resident of the home. Defendant performed oral sex on the child and attempted to sodomize him.

Defendant argued that the trial court failed to adequately consider the mitigating circumstances listed in La. Code Crim. Proc.

The appellate court affirmed the sentence and noted that aggravating factors relevant to the case included art. 894.1(B)(2), (B)(9), and (B)(13) in that the victim was particularly vulnerable or incapable of resistance due to his mental retardation, the offense resulted in a civil suit against defendant for damages which could not be recovered in a criminal matter, and defendant occupied a supervisory position to the victim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a medical malpractice claim filed by appellee heirs of a state prisoner after the prisoner died while incarcerated, the Twelfth Judicial District Court, Parish of Avoyelles (Louisiana), found that the heirs were not required to go through a medical review panel before filing their suit. The trial court then dismissed appellant State's exceptions of lack of subject matter jurisdiction and prematurity. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner died in state custody due to illness caused by sickle cell anemia. After his death, the heirs filed a wrongful death and survival action. The suit alleged that the State committed medical malpractice and, thus, caused the prisoner's death. The heirs did not go through a medical review panel before bringing their malpractice claim. The appellate court found that the wording of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.39.1(A)(1) of the Medical Liability for State Services Act was clear and unambiguous. The appellate court found that the statute excluded claims where the patient was a prisoner and claims by persons other than the prisoner himself. Specifically, the appellate court found that the phrase &quot;other than claims wherein patients are prisoners&quot; would exclude from the medical review panel process claims by patients who were prisoners and claims of a person that arose from the claim of the prison patient. Thus, the heirs were not required to go through a medical review panel because the specific wording of the statute excluded them from that process. Therefore, the trial court properly dismissed the State's exceptions of lack of subject matter jurisdiction and prematurity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The mistrial statute,&nbsp;La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 775, did not apply to a missing witness under the particular facts of the case. The court further found that, based on the jurisprudence holding that double jeopardy protections did not apply to habitual offender proceedings, defendant's counsel was not ineffective for failing to file a motion to quash the bill of information on the basis of double jeopardy. Finally, the court found that defendant's 66-year enhanced sentence as a third felony offender was not constitutionally excessive. Defendant faced a sentencing range between 66 and 198 years of imprisonment at hard labor. The record revealed no patent errors in the case.</SPAN></P>

The defendant was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence. He appealed, but the court affirmed, stating that the trial court did not err in denying his Batson challenge because the prosecutor's reason for challenging the prospective juror was based on his belief that her attire was disrespectful to the court. And, wearing a jogging suit was not a characteristic that was peculiar to any racial group. Further, defendant did not make a showing of purposeful discrimination. The court concluded that his sentence was not unduly harsh pursuant to La. Rev. Stat.

On appeal, the court found that: (1) the trial court's failure to observe the statutory delay of La. Code Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Fourteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Calcasieu (Louisiana), which convicted him of the molestation of a juvenile in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81.2 and sentenced him to eight years at hard labor with four years suspended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the molestation of a juvenile pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81.2 and was sentenced to eight years at hard labor with four years suspended. He was dating the mother of the victim at the time of the incidents. The court affirmed both the conviction and sentence, however, stating that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction. The trial court chose to believe the testimony of the juvenile, which was a credibility determination that the court would not disturb. The court further concluded that his sentence was not excessive because the judge considered the pre-sentence investigation report (PSI), the supplement to the PSI, the testimony of the victim's mother, and defendant's statements. The judge also considered several factors set forth in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 before sentencing him. The court did vacate the trial court's order imposing the condition of parole concerning defendant's contact with children because the trial court had no authority with regard to that phase of the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment and vacated the trial court's order imposing the condition of parole concerning defendant's contact with children. Further, the case was remanded for the trial court to impose and set the amount of a probation supervision fee and for defendant to be informed of the prescriptive period for filing post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, State of Louisiana, Division &quot;P,&quot; found defendant guilty of aggravated rape. Defendant was sentence of life imprisonment at hard labor, without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, with credit for time served. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of raping his estranged wife. The wife's testimony that she fought unsuccessfully to repel defendant was supported by the other evidence. Defendant's torso was scratched in many places, the wife had marks and an abrasion on her face, and a spot of blood was on her shirt. Also, the wife was visibly upset when she described the events to the police and the doctor and her trial testimony was consistent with her interviews. Additionally, the law did not require that defendant, but only that such force was used that the victim could not dislodge defendant. The jury heard the testimony of the wife, the witnesses, defendant, and apparently believed the wife that the degree of force used by defendant to subdue her was such that a verdict of aggravated rape was warranted. Thus, the evidence was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find defendant guilty of aggravated rape beyond a reasonable doubt. Also, the trial court did not err in rejecting defendant's request for a downward deviation of the mandatory sentence. Finally, defendant was not deprived of a fair trial by ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, but remanded the case to the trial judge so that the judge could inform defendant of the sex offender registration requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company had leased the subject property to operate seasonal fireworks sales establishments. The city annexed the property into its corporate limits in 2000, such that the property became subject to the city's ordinance that prohibited the sale of fireworks within the corporate limits. The ordinance's application to the annexed property had the effect of preventing the company from continuing its fireworks sales on the leased property. The company filed suit to recover its lost profits from the city, asserting that the annexation constituted an unconstitutional taking of its property. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city. The appellate court affirmed the grant of summary judgment. The appellate court noted that, while a lessee could require the city to provide compensation for the expropriation of leased property, the property here was not taken or damaged by the annexation for purposes of eminent domain compensation. The court also held that there was no evidence that the company was led to believe that its business would not be affected by the ordinance or that the person from the city who made such a representation had the authority to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An original charge against defendant in 1996, of first degree murder, was quashed by the trial court, and subsequently dismissed by the State. However, in 2002, based on the same underlying offense, a grand jury returned an indictment charging defendant with second degree murder. The Fourteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Calcasieu, Louisiana, quashed the latter indictment, and ordered defendant's release. The State sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was clear from the trial court's ruling that it calculated the time delay for commencement of trial, from the date of the original indictment. That was improper, because the dismissal of the first indictment was the result of that indictment being quashed. The State's re-indictment was not for the purpose of avoiding the time limitation established by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 578. The State had two years from the filing of the second degree murder charge to bring defendant to trial. Thus, the trial court erred in quashing the second degree murder indictment. The remaining issue was whether defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial was violated. The appellate court applied the four factors under Barker v. Wingo. Here, defendant had been incarcerated since his arrest in 1996, so prejudice could be presumed. However, the record established severe problems in obtaining, and retaining, and funding qualified counsel for defendant, and that the vast majority of the delays, continuances for trial, and for hearings on pretrial motions, were attributable to the defense. Defendant failed to proffer what a purported eyewitness, who had died, would have testified to.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that as the 1996 indictment for first degree murder had already been dismissed, the trial court was incorrect in granting a motion to quash that indictment. The appellate court held defendant was not denied his statutory or constitutional right to speedy trial, and the trial court's order quashing the indictment for second degree murder was reversed. The matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon remand for sentencing for attempted possession of cocaine, the Louisiana Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, No. 417-430, Section I, sentenced defendant under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1A, before being amended by 2001 La. Acts 403, effective on June 15, 2001, as a multiple drug offender to life imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. Defendant appealed the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Louisiana Supreme Court had decided that the appeals court's prior decision was correct that the 2001 La. Acts 403 amendments to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, which provided for a sentencing range of from 20 years to life was not applicable because defendant's attempted possession occurred before its June 15, 2001 effective date. However, even though the mandatory life sentence provided by &sect; 15:529.1, before 2001 La. Acts 403, had been declared constitutional as a part of the entire Habitual Offender Law being declared constitutional, the imposition of a mandatory life sentence could still be unconstitutionally excessive under the facts of a particular case, such as defendant's case. The trial court, which had originally imposed a 30-year sentence, had apparently imposed the mandatory minimum life sentence on remand because it believed that sentence was its only alternative. The appeals court stated that, upon another remand, the trial court was to consider the Dorthey case to determine whether to impose a lesser sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court reversed the sentencing judgment and remanded the case for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police jury adopted an ordinance creating the mosquito control sales tax district. On that same date, the police jury, acting as the district's governing authority, adopted a resolution calling for a special election to place the proposition before the voters authorizing the district to levy and collect the tax. The electors cast more votes for the proposition than against it. Thereafter, the police jury passed a resolution declaring that the proposition was carried by a majority of the qualified voters, voting in the special election. The town and mayor filed suit, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:1405(E), contesting the legality of the election and the tax authorized by the passing of the proposition. The trial court found that the constitutional and statutory law permitted the police jury to hold the election to create the district and levy taxes for the district. After the town and mayor appealed, the appellate court found that constitutional law allowed a police jury, as a local government subdivision, to have the authority to levy and collect sales taxes, while statutory law permitted it to create a special district to use the additional tax so authorized.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Defendant's motions for post verdict judgment of acquittal, and a motion for new trial, were denied. Defendant's subsequent direct appeal was dismissed as untimely. The Twenty-Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Charles, Louisiana, then granted defendant's uniform application for post-conviction relief, seeking an out-of-time appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties stipulated that defendant had a prior felony conviction for unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling. Defendant argued his 15-year sentence, the maximum punishment allowed under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.1, was unconstitutionally excessive, considering that he was offered a six-year sentence prior to trial as part of a plea agreement. However, the fact that a defendant did not accept a plea bargain was not a factor listed for consideration under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. Contrary to defendant's argument, the trial court did give an adequate explanation for the maximum sentence. Aggravating factors were that defendant deliberately shot the victim in the buttocks, and also put the safety of many other people in jeopardy. Defendant's argument that the victim was not a reliable witness, was rejected. The shooting did occur at night, and the victim did not actually testify that defendant &quot;fired&quot; the gun. But &quot;firing&quot; the gun was not a necessary element of the crime. Although there were inconsistencies in the victim's testimony regarding certain details, he consistently stated that defendant had a gun. Thus, the evidence supported defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

Defendants, individual and town, filed a motion for a suspensive appeal, and the claimant filed a motion seeking dismissal of the suspensive appeal as untimely perfected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant moved for a new trial, and on the same day, defendants filed a motion for suspensive appeal of the judgment. The trial court refused to sign the attached order granting the suspensive appeal, and denied it as premature, pending a ruling on the pleadings filed by the claimant. The trial court denied the claimant's motion for a new trial as untimely, and defendants filed a second motion for a suspensive appeal. Defendants argued that the claimant's motion to dismiss their appeal was untimely and should be dismissed. The appellate court ruled that the claimant's motion to dismiss the appeal was timely filed. The appellate court found that the subsequently filed motion for appeal was untimely, however, the untimely filing was not due to an error imputable to defendants. The appeal was perfected untimely because the trial court erroneously refused to sign the appeal order until a formal judgment denying the motion for a new trial had been signed. The failure of the trial court to promptly consider and sign the motion for a suspensive appeal was not an irregularity, error, or defect imputable to defendants, La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 2161.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed the conviction because of the unavailability of a trial transcript and remanded for a new trial. Defendant was again found guilty and was sentenced to 40 years at hard labor. She contended on appeal that the trial court erred in denying her motion to quash the indictment, based on the expiration of the 1-year time limitation for a new trial in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 582. The court found that the period of limitation had been interrupted, pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 583, by defendant's filing of a motion to release her without bail on the ground of a statutory speedy trial violation and by her appeal from the denial of that motion. Consequently, defendant's retrial was timely. The court also found that defendant's sentence was not excessive under the standards of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, because the killing was a vicious act. After strangling and stabbing the victim, defendant left the body for the victim's young son to find. The maximum sentence for manslaughter was not too severe under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The State alleged defendant to be a second felony offender based on a prior armed robbery conviction. Defendant admitted the allegations in the multiple offender bill, and the 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Division &quot;M&quot; (Louisiana), imposed a sentence of 50 years at hard labor without benefit of probation. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence used to convict him. He pointed out that one of the victims could not identify him as the perpetrator and further that the testimony of the two victims was inconsistent with their prior statements to the police. He also argued that the state failed to prove the element of force or intimidation. Although the victim could not identify defendant from the photographic lineup, other evidence at the trial negated the reasonable probability of misidentification. Defendant placed himself at the scene of the crime with a companion and both victims positively identified defendant's companion from a photographic lineup. Additionally, the other victim identified defendant at trial as the gunman. One victim testified that defendant did not point the guns directly at him; however, the victim testified that he was afraid. The appellate court held that no verbal threat was required to satisfy that element of armed robbery. It was reasonable to infer that the victim was afraid, as he was on the passenger's side of the van looking through the van at defendant who was armed with two guns. Defendant created an atmosphere of intimidation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of simple burglary, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:62. The State agreed that the use of defendant's prior violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.1 to enhance the sentence was erroneous. The 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Division &quot;O&quot; (Louisiana), resentenced defendant as a second felony offender to 12 years at hard labor. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court imposed an excessive multiple offender sentence. The appellate court held that defendant's failure to file a motion to reconsider sentence or to have stated specific grounds upon which the motion was based limited defendant to a bare review of the sentence for constitutional excessiveness. In the case at bar, the trial court mistakenly found defendant to have been a third felony offender. The trial court subsequently found defendant to have been a second felony offender, vacated the life sentence, and sentenced him to 12 years of imprisonment at hard labor. The appellate court held that the jurisprudence suggested that defendant's 12-year sentence was neither shocking nor grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime committed. Defendant's 12-year sentence was at the lower end of the sentencing range, and the appellate court found that he could have received up to 24 years of imprisonment. Additionally, defendant had a prior conviction in 1986 for simple robbery. Under the circumstances of the case at bar, the appellate court found that the sentence was not excessive and that the trial judge had not abused his discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's adjudication as a second felony offender and defendant's sentence of 12 years imprisonment were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fifteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Acadia, Louisiana, denied plaintiff town's request to enjoin a special tax election. The town appealed, asserting defendant parish police jury, acting as the governing authority of the Mosquito Control Sales Tax District of the parish had no statutory or constitutional authority to adopt a resolution calling for the election to authorize the District to levy and collect a tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town's suit objected to the calling of a special election. Pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:1405(G), such actions had to be instituted within 14 days after the calling of the election. The calling of the special election occurred on May 20, 2003, by resolution. Suit was not instituted until June 25, 2003, past the 14-day period. A precedent decision established that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:1405(A), which allowed a 10 day period for one to object to a candidate's qualifications for office, was a peremptive period. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:1405(A) (B) and (G) contained the same operative language with respect to delays, all stating that actions &quot;shall be instituted&quot; within the time period set forth therein. Having failed to file their claim within the 14-day period, the town's action was lost. The town could not object to the calling of the special election. The town's remedy was therefore limited to challenging the legality of the election and tax, if authorized, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:1405(E).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court denying the town's request for an injunction was affirmed. Costs of the appeal were assessed against the town.</SPAN></P>

The partnerships sought specific performance of the agreements and damages. The homeowners association challenged the validity of the agreement as it claimed the authority under which the creation of the PUD was based was unconstitutional. The appellate court noted that the state supreme court had held that La. Const. of 1921, art. XIV, &sect; 29, as amended, did not prohibit the establishment of other types of districts best suited to the needs of the local population. The appellate court held that a PUD qualified as an &quot;other type of district&quot; that was best suited to the needs of the population, and thus, the authority under which the PUD was planned was not unconstitutional. The appellate court also held that that it was within the parish's police power, delegated to it by the state, to enter into a development agreement with the partnerships.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of one count of cruelty to the infirmed. The State filed a habitual offender bill of information against the defendant, alleging he was a fourth felony habitual offender. The 22nd Judicial District Court, St. Tammany Parish (Louisiana), sentenced defendant to seven years of imprisonment at hard labor and denied defendant's motion for a new trial and motion for reconsideration of the sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for cruelty to the infirmed. Defendant also argued that his sentence was constitutionally excessive. The appellate court rejected defendant's arguments. The defendant's shoving of the victim with both hands sufficiently established his general criminal intent to mistreat the victim, and the pain caused to the victim was not an inevitable consequence of care and treatment, and thus, was unjustifiable. Further, defendant, a third felony habitual offender, shoved his 84 year-old grandmother into kitchen furniture with both hands, thereby causing her unjustifiable pain and bruises. Thus, defendant's sentence of seven years at hard labor was not unconstitutionally excessive and not grossly disproportionate to the severity of the offense.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court initially granted a writ to examine the record more closely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient underwent a hysterectomy at the hospital in early 1980. In a deposition, she stated that she received at least 10 units of blood supplied to the hospital by the blood center. She alleged that she was diagnosed with Hepatitis C in late 1998 and had no other risk factors for the disease. The trial court noted that her first doctor's records were full of modifications and that he did not give her enough information to excite her suspicion as to diagnosis and cause. Specifically, the doctor did not consider the condition serious enough to warrant further tests or treatment, so he did not put her on notice. By contrast, a second doctor made it clear to the patient in late 1998 that she had Hepatitis C and probably contracted it from the blood transfusions. The appellate court found that the trial court was not plainly wrong to find that the patient did not have actual or constructive knowledge of her condition or its cause from her first doctor and that she only received actual knowledge of those matters from the second doctor. Thus, her petition for a medical review panel, filed in June 1999, was timely. Also, the claim against the blood center was also timely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court recalled its writ, affirmed the trial court's judgment denying the hospital's and the blood center's exceptions of prescription, and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of distribution of cocaine in the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana. Defendant was sentenced as a third felony offender, with prior convictions for distribution of cocaine, and possession of cocaine. Defendant's motion to reconsider sentence was denied. Defendant appealed, asserting there was insufficient to support his conviction, and that he was entrapped into committing the offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence established that an agent stopped his vehicle, rolled down the window, and asked defendant where he could get &quot;two 20s.&quot; Two $ 20s was street slang for 2 rocks of crack cocaine. Defendant entered the passenger's side of the detective's vehicle and gave the detective directions to a house. The detective gave defendant $ 40, and defendant returned with 2 rocks of cocaine. Videotaped and audiotaped recordings of the events were entered into evidence. Defendant asserted several fairly minor contradictions between the officer's testimony, the police report, and what actually transpired. However, the appellate court found that a rational trier of fact could have found defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. As to entrapment, defendant failed to establish that the detective induced him to distribute cocaine. The evidence indicated that the detective merely furnished an opportunity for defendant to distribute crack cocaine, and there was considerable evidence that defendant was predisposed to sell cocaine. Finally, defendant signed a habitual offender bill of information, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, and was precluded from challenging his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed. However, the matter was remanded for the trial court to advise defendant of the prescriptive period for filing post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand, defendant again pled not guilty to a multiple bill. He filed a motion to quash the multiple bill, which was denied, and defendant was found to be a fourth offender. Defendant was re-sentenced by the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Section &quot;F&quot; (Louisiana), as a fourth offender to 20 years at hard labor without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence. Defendant's motion to reconsider sentence was denied and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, defendant claimed the trial court erred in adjudicating him a fourth felony habitual offender. He was charged with having committed three previous offenses: attempted simple burglary in 1995, distribution of false drugs in 1989, and three counts of distribution of cocaine in 1988. At the multiple bill hearing, a fingerprint expert testified that defendant's fingerprints matched the arrest register in the 1988 conviction. The State also introduced the bill of information, a guilty plea form containing the Boykin rights, a minute entry, and a docket master pertaining to the 1988 conviction. Defendant's fingerprints matched those on the back of the bill of information. Lastly, the fingerprint expert testified that defendant's fingerprints matched those on the arrest register of the 1994 conviction. The State introduced the bill of information, a multiple bill of information, the guilty plea form, the docket master, and the minute entry. Defendant's fingerprints matched those on the back of the bill of information. Considering defendant's extensive and serious criminal record, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to deviate from the minimum sentence.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court of Louisiana granted the State's writ application, reinstated the conviction and sentence, and remanded the matter for consideration of defendant's remaining claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the attempted murder of her estranged husband and for the murder of her three-year-old son, after she shot both of them and then shot herself. After it was found that she voluntarily waived a jury trial, on remand the court reviewed the rest of her claims and affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the convictions. Defendant asserted the insanity defense with regard to the second-degree murder charge, but the court found that she did not prove that she was unable to distinguish right from wrong at the time of the shootings. Defendant admitted that she took her father's gun without his knowledge, that she put her child in her husband's arms, and that she shot her husband. Her mother admitted to telling police that defendant pointed the gun at the child. Moreover, two witnesses testified that defendant made threats regarding the husband and the child. The court affirmed the mandatory sentence for second-degree murder and the mandatory minimum sentence for attempted second-degree murder, to be served consecutively. Defendant failed to show that she was exceptional under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences. The court further directed the trial court to inform defendant of the two-year time limit for filing post conviction relief and to file written proof that defendant received the notice in the record of the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate sued defendant state to recover lost property. The state responded by filing a declinatory exception of improper venue and a dilatory exception of prematurity. The exception to venue was granted, and the 20th Judicial District Court, Louisiana, transferred the matter. The inmate filed a writ application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the inmate was transferred in the prison system, he alleged that his personal property was lost. On appeal, the issue was whether the lost property claims were controlled by the Corrections Administrative Remedy Procedure and, therefore, subject to judicial review of the record under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1177 or were the property claims tort claims and thereby under the district court's original jurisdiction? The appellate court concluded that lost property claims were classic matters of prison administration or conditions of confinement. Moreover, the inmate was not raising a claim of unconstitutional deprivation of a vested property right. Thus, the grant of the motion to transfer venue was proper, as the district court had appellate jurisdiction over claims brought pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1171, et seq.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), of armed robbery. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by sentencing him to 198 years at hard labor based on a prior juvenile conviction in which he had not been afforded the right to a trial by jury. The court of appeal agreed. The juvenile matter was heard by a judge, not a jury. The juvenile court, however, did employ the requisite beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard. The defense asserted that the circumstances of that conviction (for attempted second degree murder) demonstrated the problem with considering a juvenile conviction as an Apprendi exception. A statement from defendant at the age of 14 indicated that there was no evidence that that he participated in the crime resulting in the girl's death. In fact, the statement indicated instead that he tried to help the victim. Yet, he was adjudicated guilty of attempted second degree murder. To use such a defective juvenile adjudication to constitute a &quot;prior conviction&quot; for purposes of the Apprendi exception, and allow such prior conviction to be used to enhance the statutory penalty for the instant offense was constitutionally improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was affirmed. The sentence was reversed and the case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The Civil District Court of Orleans Parish, Louisiana, declared that the bonds, the proceedings held, and the actions of the board were valid and binding on appellants, citizens, taxpayers, and property owners (citizens). The citizens appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the citizens contended, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying their motion to compel more complete answers to discovery, the state bond commission's rules and regulations governing the filing of bonds were violated by the board, and the bond issuance in question was contrary to law. The appellate court found that the citizens filed their motion to compel less than two days before the hearing and that most of the requested records were a matter of public record and not beyond the reach of the citizens. Their requests for admissions were adequately answered by the board and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in so finding. Further, the board's filing of the amended resolution to its previously approved bond application did not constitute a substantial defect, or material error or omission. As the alleged &quot;donation&quot; of public funds was the exemption from payment of ad valorem taxes for the lessee of the property in question, no governmental entity was actually giving up anything of value, insofar as the property owned by the board would not be subject to ad valorem taxes. Thus, no improper donation of public funds to a private entity existed.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 40:966(B)(1) did not provide that the sentence for distribution was restricted as to &quot;parole.&quot; A major issue however, was a discrepancy in the statutory sentencing provisions. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 40:979(B), provided that the sentence for &quot;attempt to distribute heroin or certain narcotics&quot; would be imprisonment for not less than &quot;eight years.&quot; However, the sentence for the greater offense of actual distribution of heroin or certain narcotics under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(B)(1), was not less than &quot;five years.&quot; Thus, the minimum sentence for the lesser-included offense was more severe than the minimum sentence for the greater offense. The appellate court concluded that under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, a more stringent sentence for the attempted crime, than for the actual crime, was an excessive sentence. Thus, defendant's sentence on the attempt crime was left at five years. For the same reason, defendant's sentence on the attempt crime was amended to allow for parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's five-year sentence for his conviction on one count of distribution of heroin was amended to exclude any restriction on parole. Defendant's sentence for the lesser-included offense of attempt to distribute heroin, was left at five years, because correction to the statutory minimum of eight years would have been constitutionally excessive. For the same reason, the attempted crime was amended to exclude any restrictions on parole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An administrative complaint was filed against respondent doctor. The Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners (board) held a hearing. The board revoked the doctor's license to practice medicine. The Civil District Court, New Orleans Parish, Division &quot;B&quot; (Louisiana), affirmed, but clarified the board's decision to reflect that fewer patients were involved than might have been suggested by the board's opinion. The doctor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The crux of the complaint against the doctor was that he prescribed narcotics and other controlled substance drugs to patients without performing physical examinations and without legitimate medical purpose in exchange for payments by those patients. The doctor claimed that expert testimony was needed to explain the meaning of the statutes involved. Unlike a jury of laypersons, the board was made up of physicians and was able to evaluate medical issues without the assistance of expert testimony. As to the argument that the statutes and regulations were unconstitutionally vague in the absence of expert testimony as to their meaning, the appellate court found dispositive the board's findings of fact that the doctor knew what the statutes and regulations meant and that any properly educated physician would have known what they meant. The doctor failed to take advantage of the second La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:961 961(c) meeting offered him, by insisting, improperly, that the meeting be transcribed by a court reporter. Further, he failed to preserve any right he had to another meeting by voluntarily going forward with discovery, and he thus waived the 961(c) meeting.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), denied defendant's motion to suppress and convicted him of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and distribution of cocaine. The State filed a multiple bill, and, after hearing, the trial court found him to be a third felony offender. He was sentenced as such to life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after he sold crack cocaine to an undercover officer. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and seven and one-half years on the distribution conviction. Defendant appealed stating that the life sentence was excessive. The appellate court found that there was substantial evidence to rebut the presumption that the mandated life sentence was constitutional because (1) defendant had a supportive family who wanted to help him; (2) he was not in possession of a weapon when arrested, had no money in his possession, and was only a petty street drug pusher and not a major drug dealer; (3) he was a non-violent offender; (4) he admitted to his addiction; and (5) he was employed prior to his incarceration. Furthermore, because of a change in the Habitual Offender Law since his conviction, he would not qualify for a life term under the current law. Thus, the life sentence imposed was not proportionate to the crimes for which he was convicted and the sentence made no measurable contribution to the acceptable goals of punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed defendant's seven and one-half year sentence on the distribution conviction. The appellate court vacated defendant's life sentence as a multiple offender on the possession of cocaine with intent to distribute conviction and remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

Trial Court No. 450,017. Honorable Frank H. Thaxton, III, Judge.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Amended, and as amended, affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant timber owner brought a suit against appellee timber company and timber co-owner three years after the timber had been cut. The First Judicial District Court, Parish of Caddo (Louisiana), found in favor of the owner under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3:4278.1, the &quot;timber piracy&quot; statute. It found that the company and the co-owner acted in good faith, but ordered the pay damages and attorney fees to the owner. The parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The timber company alleged that the trial court erred when it applied &sect; 3:4278.1, as it cut and removed the timber from the property in question &quot;in accordance with specific terms of a legal contract or agreement&quot; with the co-owner. The Court of Appeal of Louisiana, Second Circuit, held that &sect; 3:4278.1(A) allowed a timber buyer to escape the imposition of treble damages, if the buyer cut and removed timber with &quot;the consent of&quot; or at &quot;the direction of&quot; or with &quot;a legal contract or agreement&quot; with &quot;the owner or legal possessor,&quot; where &quot;the owner&quot; was defined, in co-ownership situations, as at least 80 percent of the ownership interest in the land. The court's opinion relied heavily on the public policy describing the company's failure to identify and consult all co-owners as presumptive timber theft. The statute altered any implication of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 798 suggesting that a single co-owner could produce a fruit or product of the immovable and owe only an accounting to a co-owner. The company's actions of cutting and removing the timber from the land without the consent of the owner constituted a violation of &sect; 3:4278.1(A) and (C), and it was liable for treble damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The damages awarded by the trial court were amended and increased to $ 22,500, and the attorney fees awarded were increased to $ 3,523. In all other respects the judgment was affirmed at the timber company's costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the First Judicial District Court, Parish of Caddo (Louisiana), found defendant guilty of attempted possession of cocaine. Defendant was adjudicated a habitual offender and sentenced to 20 years at hard labor, without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police conducted a sweep of a block in response to citizens' complaints about drug activity there. An officer saw defendant toss a plastic baggie on the ground. The baggie containing two rocks that appeared to be crack cocaine was recovered. Defendant was placed under arrest, advised of his Miranda rights, and escorted to the police car. Defendant offered to help the officers, but then recanted his statement and stated that he did not want to help the officers. The appellate court found that any rational jury could have concluded that the State established the essential elements of the crime of attempted possession of cocaine beyond a reasonable doubt. Also, the appellate court found that defendant's statement to the officers was voluntary, as it was not made in response to inducements by the officers. Additionally, when defendant tossed away the baggie, which contained suspected cocaine, the officers had probable cause to arrest defendant. Further, defendant's prior convictions were valid for habitual offender purposes, and his 20-year sentence was not excessive; however, the trial court erred in imposing the sentence without the benefit of parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court amended defendant's sentence to remove the restriction on parole eligibility and, as amended, it affirmed defendant's conviction for attempted possession of cocaine and his adjudication as a fourth offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was given a suspended sentence conditioned on sex offender registration after he pleaded guilty to one count of indecent behavior with a juvenile. His probation was revoked for failure to register. He failed to register after completing his prison sentence. The Fourteenth Judicial District Court Parish of Calcasieu (Louisiana) granted his motion to quash an indictment for violating La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:542(F)(1). The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence for a sex crime included a requirement that he register as a sex offender pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:540 et seq. In his pro se motion to quash his indictment for failure to register defendant claimed that the completion of his sentence entitled him to a first offender pardon under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:572 and La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 5(E)(1). The court disagreed. The court held that the first offender pardon statutory and constitutional provisions did not apply until defendant had completed his sentence and that an essential element of defendant's sentence was registration as a sex offender. The court noted that the purpose of the sex offender registration statute was to protect the public and aid in police investigations. The court also noted that a first offender pardon did not equate a full gubernatorial pardon, the former only reinstating basic citizenship rights, and further held that the pardon addressed in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:542.1(H)(1) was a full gubernatorial pardon. The court held that the issue of any mistake of law claim by defendant was not properly before it and remanded the case to the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The Nineteenth Judicial District Court, East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, held La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33.22182. was constitutional and denied the Commission's request for injunctive relief. The Commission appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature enacted La. Rev. Stat.

The Commission argued that &sect; 33.2218.2(A)(2)(a) was unconstitutional, as it was in derogation of the authority granted to the Commission in La. Const. art. XI, &sect;10(A)(1) to regulate the compensation of employees in state classified service. The appellate court agreed and reversed the trial court's ruling that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33.2218.2(A)(2)(a) was constitutional. The appellate court held that &sect; 33.2218.2(A)(2)(a) was unconstitutional, as it was clearly in derogation of the uniform pay plan for employees in classified service established by the Commission. Further the legislature's enactment of &sect; 33.2218.2(A)(2)(a) was not a constitutional exercise of the legislature's plenary power to enact legislation under La. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At a preliminary injunction hearing, the 17th Judicial District Court, Lafourche Parish (Louisiana), denied appellant parish council's request for injunctive relief requesting that appellee parish president be enjoined from unilaterally awarding contracts for road construction without the council's approval and ordered the council to pay the attorney for the parish president.

The council filed an ex parte petition for injunctive relief requesting that the parish president be enjoined from unilaterally awarding contracts for road construction without its approval. Considering that the trial court specifically stated that the issue of sanctions was not before it, La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 863 was inapplicable, and attorney fees would be improper under that provision. Also, because La. Rev. Stat.

The State filed a multiple offender bill of information, charging defendant as a third felony offender. The 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Division &quot;J&quot; (Louisiana), sentenced defendant to life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to properly arraign him on the habitual offender bill and additionally erred in failing to properly advise him of his right to remain silent and of the right to have a formal hearing prior to his stipulation to the multiple bill. At the multiple offender hearing, defense counsel informed the court that his client wished to stipulate to the allegations contained in the multiple bill. The trial judge additionally advised defendant that the district attorney would have to prove: (1) that he had a prior felony; (2) the appropriate time period between felonies; and (3) that he was properly advised of his rights at those proceedings. The court advised that, if he were to have a trial on the instant matter, he would have the right to remain silent, the right to cross-examine all witnesses against him, and the right to call his own witnesses. The appellate court held that defendant was properly advised of his rights and that he knowingly and intelligently waived his rights, particularly his right to a formal hearing and his right to remain silent, prior to stipulating to the multiple offender bill of information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and co-defendant were indicted for first-degree murder. Defendant moved to suppress his confession, then a motion for a lunacy hearing was filed. Testimony on the competency issue was heard, and the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Section &quot;E&quot; (Louisiana), found that defendant was competent to proceed to trial, but granted the motion to suppress his confession. The State objected and sought writs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the trial court erred in suppressing defendant's confession on the grounds that his mental retardation precluded him from making a knowing and voluntary waiver of his rights. Defendant's statement, reflected that he was arrested for a carjacking, but he also told the officers that he had been with two others when they were involved in a shooting. Defendant's aunt was with him when he made his statement, but she stated that she was upset and just cried. A police sergeant testified that defendant completed the waiver of rights form prior to giving a taped statement; in fact he testified that defendant's completion of the form was reflected in the taped statement, even though the statement showed that defendant said he could not read or write well, so the sergeant read the form to defendant. The expert testimony overwhelmingly indicated that defendant was not able to understand and intelligently waive his rights as given to him at the time he made his statement. The extrinsic evidence that would have mitigated against the experts' opinions was minimal. The appellate court could not say the trial court had been manifestly erroneous in suppressing the confession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's writ was granted, but the trial court's ruling suppressing defendant's statement was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A grand jury indicted defendants for first-degree murder. The Orleans Parish criminal district court granted defendants' motion to quash their indictments based on equal protection and due process violations in the selection of the grand jury foreperson in Orleans Parish from 1987 to 2000. The State appealed directly to the Louisiana Supreme Court, which transferred the matter to the court to be treated as an appeal by the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court quashed defendants' indictment, finding that they presented a prima facie case of discrimination in the selection of the jury forepersons in violation of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the federal Constitution and that former La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 413(C) was an unconstitutional local or special law. The State claimed that defendants failed to show a prima facie case of discrimination in the selection of grand jury forepersons between 1987 and 2000. The court agreed. Defendants failed to make a statistical showing of substantial under-representation of African Americans and women over a substantial period of time. The judge who selected the grand jury testified that he attempted to seat a grand jury representative of the parish's demographics. Such did not address selection of the forepersons. Moreover, defendants' statistical evidence was drawn from incomplete data, and the selecting judge's race and gender, relied on in defendants' analyses, were irrelevant. There was also no proof of a due process violation, especially given that the foreperson's role was ministerial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's decision quashing the indictments and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, defendant was charged with possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia, both misdemeanors.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:716(B)(1), which authorized the commissioner to sign search warrants. A judge testified and explained that the judges recommended that the commissioner post be created by the legislature in order to reduce their workload and improve court efficiency by having the commissioner handle as many minor matters as possible so that the judges could devote more time to jury trials. The judge acknowledged that judges discussed the possible constitutional problems with delegating judicial authority to a commissioner who was appointed, not elected. The Court of Appeal of Louisiana, Third Circuit, concluded that &sect; 13:716(B)(1) was unconstitutional. Defendant's constitutional due process rights were impaired by the legislature's grant of authority to appointed commissioners. The commissioner's finding of probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant was a final determination that was not reviewed by an elected judge who was vested with judicial power by the state constitution. However, the appellate court held that the portion of section (B)(1) of &sect; 13:716 pertaining to search warrants was severable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Third Judicial District Court, Parish of Lincoln, Louisiana, convicted defendant of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. He was adjudicated to be a second felony habitual offender and his sentences were to run consecutively without benefit. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to convict him of the offenses and contended the trial court erred by allowing the State to mention in front of the jury the name and nature of his prior convictions. The appellate court found that the marijuana was in the motel in which defendant was staying. His actual possession was established by the testimony of a co-defendant, who stated that the marijuana belonged to defendant and that he was selling marijuana out of his van. As there was no internal contradiction or irreconcilable conflict with the physical evidence, this accomplice's testimony, which was not uncorroborated, was sufficient support for a requisite factual conclusion. Further, the officers' testimony clearly proved that the firearm was subject to defendant's dominion and control, as it was located under the covers in close proximity to defendant's hand. The use of the prior felonies was appropriate to prove defendant was a convicted felon. Denial of defendant's motion to suppress was proper, as the law enforcement officers were lawfully at the door of the motel room where the presence of the marijuana was in plain view.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were affirmed; his sentence for possession of marijuana was amended, deleting the requirement that the first five years of the sentence be served without benefit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city instituted a petition for declaratory judgment, naming as defendant, the Legislative Auditor of the State of Louisiana. The city sought a judgment declaring that a city ordinance granting a temporary abatement of municipal ad valorem taxes did not violate La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 20(A)(3). The Twenty-Fourth judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), granted partial summary judgment for the city. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court declared that the legislative auditor did not have power and/or authority to determine the constitutionality vel non of ordinances adopted by the city. The trial court also declared that the taxes levied by the city were &quot;special taxes&quot; that were subject to the homestead exemption, as provided in La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 20(A)(1). The legislative auditor contended that he was not attempting to challenge the constitutionality of a municipal ordinance, but was merely attempting to adhere to his obligation to approve of the ad valorem property taxes collected by the tax recipient agency. The appellate court held the legislative auditor was required to abide by the provisions of the city ordinances, and he was without legal power or authority to withhold approval of the ad valorem property taxes of the city, absent a judicial determination, that the application of the homestead exemption to those taxes was unconstitutional. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rendering a declaratory judgment declaring that the legislative auditor did not have the power or authority to challenge the constitutionality of the city ordinances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the trial court reached the merits of the constitutional challenge to the city ordinances prematurely, the appellate court vacated and set aside, in part, the summary judgment granted insofar as it declared that the subject ordinances were special ad valorem taxes that were subject to the homestead exemption pursuant to constitutional provisions. In all other respects, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an oil and gas company, opposed another operator's request for administrative approval of an operator change for certain wells and units. After a hearing, appellee, the conservation commissioner and assistant secretary of state natural resources, granted the requested change. The decision was upheld by judgment of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant company was the designated operator of two wells that were not operating. It apparently had no intentions of conducting production operations. It had a .49 percent working interest in one unit and a 6.25 percent working interest in another. The other operator, which the commissioner designated as the new operator of record, and which intervened in the proceedings and supported the commissioner's order, had 63.53 and 87.85 percent working interests in the two wells. The appellate court found that it was realistic to assume that the party with the greater interest had more incentive to rework the wells. The company argued that the commissioner did not have authority to determine the validity of the mineral leases. However, the appellate court found that the commissioner merely took into consideration which party had a majority interest in the two units. The commissioner's authority in the instant matter was derived from La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:4. The commissioner was charged with preventing waste. The non-operation of the wells was wasteful to the other interested owners. Ownership issues in relation to wellbores and casing were not before the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After three mistrials, a jury for the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Section &quot;K&quot; (Louisiana), found defendant guilty of five counts of forcible rape and three counts of second degree kidnapping. Defendant was sentenced for each count, and the trial court sentenced defendant to two years for possessing a firearm at the time he committed at least one of the crimes. All sentences were to run concurrently. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a former police officer who was accused of raping several victims. A review of the record revealed an error patent, as La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893.3(A) only provided for a two-year mandatory minimum sentence for the offense in which defendant possessed a firearm and did not provide for a separate sentence. Thus, defendant's separate two-year sentence, pursuant to art. 893.3(A), was improper and had to be vacated. But, the evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant possessed a firearm during the commission of one of the crimes, and a mandatory minimum sentence of two years for that crime would be appropriate. Additionally, it was not a gross abuse of discretion for the trial court to deny defendant's motion to quash his indictment or to bar his fourth trial, and double jeopardy did not bar his retrial. Furthermore, the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of the forcible rapes and second-degree kidnappings of the victims. In addition, the trial court did not admit inadmissible evidence of defendant's bad character and other bad acts into evidence. However, even if it was error to admit any of the objectionable evidence, the errors were harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed defendant's convictions for forcible rape and second-degree kidnapping. The appellate court vacated in part defendant's separate two-year sentence for possession of a firearm during the commission of one of the crimes and remanded that portion of the judgment to the trial court for a factual finding and appropriate resentencing. The appellate court affirmed the remainder of defendant's sentences.</SPAN></P>

The City/Parish appealed from the judgment of the 19th Judicial District Court, Division I, Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in favor of plaintiffs. The injured person answered the appeal, seeking increased general damages and other relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured person sustained a severe back injury when she tripped on a broken sidewalk that was partially covered by vegetation. She filed an action to recover damages from the City/Parish, which was within the latter's right-of-way and its responsibility regarding care and maintenance. The City/Parish appealed from a judgment awarding damages to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs answered the appeal, seeking an increase in general damages, court costs, and a reversal of the finding that the injured person was 40 percent at fault. The court held that there was no manifest error in the conclusion that the depression in the sidewalk, which was at least partially obscured by plant material, constituted a defect that presented an unreasonable risk of danger to the ordinary, prudent pedestrian; hence, the City/Parish was properly found liable under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2317. The court also found no legal error or manifest error in the allocation of fault to the injured person under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2323(A), given that she had a four-foot-wide sidewalk, but walked exactly where the depression was, but held that she was entitled to court costs under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5112.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the judgment by awarding additional court costs to plaintiffs to be paid by the City/Parish. As amended, the court affirmed the judgment. Costs of the appeal were assessed against the City/Parish.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by imposing the maximum sentence. The court of appeals disagreed. The trial court complied with the requirements of the sentencing guidelines by taking into account both mitigating and aggravating circumstances. It listened to the numerous witnesses presented by defendant in mitigation. The trial court specifically mentioned that defendant had indicated some sense of remorse. However, it was aware of the severe injuries suffered by the victim, including temporary blindness and brain damage, at the hands of defendant, her husband, who was twice her size. The trial court was particularly impressed with defendant's callousness in beating the victim nearly to death and leaving her alone to die. For those reasons, the seriousness and callousness of the crime, in the trial court's opinion, warranted a serious sentence. A lesser sentence would have deprecated the seriousness of the offense. Therefore, the trial court did not err.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for shooting a woman after an altercation. The court found sufficient evidence in the record to support the manslaughter conviction under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:31 and the jury's rejection of defendant's self-defense claim. A witness testified that defendant shot the woman while she was seated and unarmed, expert testimony corroborated that the wound was inflicted from a standing position while the victim was seated, and no gun was found at the scene to corroborate defendant's claim that the victim was armed. The court also found that self-defense instruction, while erroneous, was not a basis for reversal. The instruction improperly put the burden of proving self-defense on defendant, but in light of all other instructions, in which the burden was properly put on the State to prove all elements of the crime and in which the jury was to determine the credibility of witnesses, the court found no prejudice. The court also affirmed the enhanced sentence under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1)(c)(ii). Defendant failed to show that he was an exceptional defendant for which downward departure from the mandatory minimum sentence was required.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:44.1A(3) or A(5) and B(3). Defendant asserted that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. The appellate court determined that the issue was whether defendant's conviction could be upheld based upon La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:44.1B(3), even though the subsection alleged in the bill of information was La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:44.1B(1). The appellate court ruled that defendant's conviction need not be reversed where the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction under one subsection of the statute, when the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant under another subsection of that statute. Furthermore, there was no merit to defendant's assertion that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:44.1 was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence, as the police lacked probable cause to conduct a warrantless search of his car's gas cap. The court of appeals disagreed. When police went to execute a search warrant, they conducted a brief surveillance from an area near defendant's residence. An officer testified that he spotted defendant four blocks from his residence standing next to a gray Buick Le Sabre. He then saw a red truck pull up next to the Le Sabre and a man exit the truck. Defendant and the truck driver then engaged in a brief conversation. The truck driver then reached into his pocket, pulled out an unknown amount of money, and handed it to defendant. Defendant walked to the gas cap compartment, pulled out a white package containing a plastic bag, and handed it to the truck driver. The truck driver then got back into the red truck and departed. Therefore, the police had probable cause to search defendant's gas cap, and the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, defendant was convicted as charged by amended bill of information with distribution of cocaine. He was subsequently charged and found guilty of being a multiple offender, and the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Section L (Louisiana), sentenced him to 20 years in the custody of the department of corrections.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction for distribution of cocaine and his sentence imposed for being a multiple offender. On appeal the court affirmed the conviction, holding that defendant's motion for a mistrial in reference to the prosecutor's comments during closing argument was properly denied. Although La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 770(2) barred the prosecutor from referencing other crimes in the closing, the court found that there was overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt to make any error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, the prosecutor's subsequent statement immediately following his reference to other crimes was not an additional reference to other crimes but was a reference to an earlier statement made by the defense. The court also held that the 20-year sentence was not excessive. It was the minimum required under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15;529.1A(1)(b)(ii), and defendant's drug addiction and non-violent criminal history were not exceptional circumstances warranting a downward deviation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty in the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, of distribution of marijuana. The State filed an amended multiple offender bill of information to allege defendant was a second felony offender. Defendant admitted to being a second felony offender and was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was observed by the police holding a brown bag with a clear plastic bag inside. As the police approached, they saw defendant receiving money from a man while simultaneously passing a clear plastic bag with green vegetable matter to the man. Both defendant and the man he was selling the drugs to were arrested. The man who bought the marijuana testified on behalf of the defense that the marijuana was his, but the jury apparently discounted that testimony and believed the testimony of the police instead. The appellate court held that: (1) sufficient evidence existed to convict defendant, as the physical evidence supported the version presented by the police, and the jury's finding that the police were more credible would not be re-weighed on appeal; (2) evidence of the marijuana and scales did not have to be suppressed, as the police had reasonable suspicion of criminal activity based on what they observed and the location where the sale took place; and (3) defendant's sentence was not excessive, as he offered no evidence other than that he was a hardworking husband to rebut the constitutionality of the mandatory minimum sentence that was imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and sentence were affirmed, but the case was remanded for the trial court to properly advise defendant of the prescription period for filing post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court previously vacated the sentence, and the State applied for a writ of certiorari. The supreme court granted the writ and remanded to the court for reconsideration. The court again vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing. On resentencing, the trial court sentenced defendant to 30 years at hard labor and defendant's motion for reconsideration of the sentence was denied. He appealed, urging that the sentence imposed was excessive. The court disagreed, however, and affirmed. At resentencing, the trial court referred back to its previous findings concerning defendant's record, the pre-sentence investigation, and considerations under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1, and then imposed the current sentence. The court stated that the amendment to La. Rev. Stat.

In addition, defendant failed to object to the jury instructions given. Therefore, the court declined to consider the issue on review. Finally, the court determined that the sentence imposed did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment. The sentence imposed was less than the maximum permitted in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:34.1.

Defendant chased him, and, when he was found, allegedly threw an object through the vehicle's window, striking the victim in the head. As a result of the incident, the victim had difficulty with speech and walking. The court affirmed the decision. Defendant argued that the State failed to negate self-defense, but the court stated that, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:21, the evidence presented clearly showed that defendant was the aggressor. Further, his sentence was not excessive, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(2)(a), as the sentencing range for defendant as a second felony offender was 2 and 1/2 years to 10 years; defendant's sentence was the minimum he could have possibly received.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employees filed a class action suit against defendants, employer, executive officers, manufacturers, distributors, and insurers, due to their exposure to asbestos. The trial court denied defendants' exception of no cause of action. The Louisiana Supreme Court held that 1999 La. Acts 989 could not retroactively bar the employees claims and remanded the action to determine if the claims were barred by the workers' compensation statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees were a class of former and current employees of the employer. The employees sought establishment of a judicially-administered medical monitoring fund and counseling program. The state supreme court previously held that medical monitoring was a compensable item of damage and that 1999 La. Acts 989 could not be applied retroactively to bar the employees' claims. The appellate court held that the employees' claims against the executive officers were not barred by the 1976 amendment to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1032, as long as the employees had significant exposure to asbestos before 1976. Finally, the appellate court noted that the employees could pursue their claims under either a state compensation scheme or the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA). 33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 901 et seq. As the employees sought compensation under the state scheme, they could sue executive officers in tort under the pre-amendment La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1032, even though that remedy was not available under the LHWCA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city council sought a judicial declaration that a proposed bond issue was valid prior to the marketing of the bonds. Defendant citizens, a group of taxpayers, property owners, and residents of the city, filed an answer, reconventional demand, and exceptions of prematurity, vagueness, and failure to state a cause of action. The Civil District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, declared that the bonds were valid. The citizens appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the citizens contended, inter alia, that the council's failure to produce a development agreement and other project documents should have precluded the trial court from validating the bonds. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the documents in the record sufficiently described the project, the source of funds, and all other material issues relevant to the bonds; the fact that subsidiary documents detailing certain aspects of the project had yet to be created did not preclude judicial validation of the bonds. Having determined that the documents were sufficient to establish the legality of the bonds, the trial court's decision that no further discovery was necessary or appropriate was not an abuse of discretion. The citizens failed to show that the dedication of the designated sales tax increments to finance the bonds either impaired any existing obligation of the city or included tax revenues previously dedicated for a special purpose, within the meaning of the TIF statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:9033.3. The citizens also failed to meet their burden of proving that the TIF statute was unconstitutionally vague or that the project lacked a public purpose.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that: (1) La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1406(D)(1)(a)(i), (ii) clearly allowed any insured named in the policy to reject UM coverage, the insured's husband was a named insured, and he had the authority under the statute to execute a valid waiver of UM coverage under the PLUP; (2) under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2346 each spouse acting alone was authorized to manage, control, or dispose of community property and because the community property laws governed the insured's husband's ability to reject UM coverage under the PLUP despite the language in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1406(D)(1)(a)(i), the appellant court did not reach the issue of the constitutionality of &sect; 22:1406(D)(1)(a)(i); and (3) the insurance rejection form complied with applicable state law in that it gave the insured a clear, meaningful choice between the three legal options available, and no legal option was foreclosed.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeal disagreed. The evidence clearly established that the child was severely abused and neglected throughout her life. The four-year-old child was bound, beaten, and deprived of food. Although the immediate cause of the child's death was listed as hypothermia, the secondary causes listed were battered child syndrome and malnourishment. Medical testimony at trial clearly indicated that the child's weakened physical condition, which was due to malnourishment and battered child syndrome, hastened her death. The medical testimony presented at trial, particularly the testimony indicating the existence of fresh or recent abusive wounds, some of which were only hours old, reasonably supports the conclusion that the child was beaten severely, possibly rendered unconscious, tied up, and left in an unheated room prior to her death. Viewing that evidence, together with defendant's admission that he intentionally struck the child and restrained her, any rational trier of fact could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was engaged in cruelty to a juvenile.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a jury trial, defendant was convicted of theft of property having a value of $ 500 or more in the Twenty-Third Judicial District Court, Parish of Ascension (Louisiana). Defendant's motions for a mistrial, and for a new trial were denied. Defendant appealed, asserting the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict of guilty for felony theft, and that the trial court erred in allowing the admission of other crimes evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State established defendant's fingerprints were discovered upon three of the 13 fraudulent checks. Numerous witnesses testified that their initials were on the subject checks, and some witnesses recognized defendant as having been at their establishments. However, most witnesses could not definitively identify defendant as the person who presented the subject checks. The appellate court was not convinced the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt, all of the elements of the offense of theft of property having a value of $ 500 or more, and defendant's identity as the perpetrator. The State's evidence established the taking of the aggregate amount of $ 304, and defendant's identity as the perpetrator of those takings. That amount included three checks which witnesses testified defendant presented, and the three checks that had defendant's fingerprints on them. No direct evidence established defendant's identity as the person who presented the other checks. Finally, the appellate court rejected defendant's argument that the testimony of two witnesses, who observed defendant at two establishments attempting to pass checks, constituted inadmissible other crimes evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for theft of property having a value of $ 500 or more was reversed, and modified to a conviction of theft of property having a value of $ 100 or more, but less than $ 500. Defendant's sentence was vacated, and the matter was remanded to the trial court for resentencing on the modified judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the First Judicial District Court, Parish of Caddo (Louisiana), of illegal use of a weapon. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction. The court of appeals disagreed. The evidence was clearly sufficient to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant utilized a dangerous weapon in the latter stages of a melee. Defendant intentionally or negligently struck the head of an infant victim with a baseball bat, which foreseeably caused a serious head injury to the infant victim. The fact that a serious closed head injury was sustained by the infant victim was not contested at trial. Also, uncontested was that the bat admitted into evidence caused the infant's head injury. At least two eyewitnesses testified that defendant ran toward the mother and the infant victim wielding the bat. Those witnesses saw defendant swing the bat and strike the victim. That scenario was partially corroborated by several witnesses, including two eyewitnesses who were uninvolved in the altercation. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and sentence were affirmed, but the probationary condition ordering restitution to the victim was vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to cultivation of marijuana, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(A)(1), and was sentenced to serve five years at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence, with credit for time served. He appealed and claimed that his sentence was excessive and the 14th Judicial District Court, Parish of Calcasieu, Louisiana, erred in not applying the amendments to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the amendments to art. 893 applied to persons convicted after June 15, 2001, and thus, the trial court erred when it applied the law in effect at the time of the offense when sentencing him. The State asserted that the sentencing provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(A) and La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893, in effect prior to the most recent amendments applied to defendant, which precluded him from receiving benefits. The appellate court held that defendant overlooked the clear reading of the act itself: 2001 La. Acts 403, &sect; 6 provided that it would only have prospective effect. It was clear the legislature intended the newly amended provision of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893 to apply to only those defendants whose crimes were committed after June 15, 2001; the fact that the new provision became effective before defendant's conviction did not extinguish his liability for the offense committed under the prior statute. Therefore, the penalty provision under the prior law was applicable to the case at bar. The appellate court also held that the five-year sentence was not so grossly disproportionate as to shock the court's sense of justice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee challenged a decision of the Office of Workers' Compensation (OWC), District 9, Parish of Iberia (Louisiana), which found that: (1) the employee failed to prove that he had an accident at work resulting in an injury; and (2) his testimony was based on misrepresentations, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1208. The trial court ordered full restitution to appellee employer and fined the employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while working. After he was fired for unrelated reasons one week later, the employee sought workers' compensation benefits. The OWC ruled against him, and the court affirmed. The OWC did not commit legal error in failing to find that the employee's injury was caused by an on-the-job accident. The employee never mentioned his alleged back injury until after he was fired, and the treating physicians believed that any such injury would have manifested itself before the employee was fired. Furthermore, the employer introduced a videotape that showed the employee performing various activities without any restriction of movement, contrary to the employee's contentions. The employee failed to meet his burden of proof. The OWC properly found a willful misrepresentation on the employee's part that justified a forfeiture of benefits, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1208. While the employee argued that the constitutionality of &sect; 23:1208 should have been considered, and while the judge writing the opinion for the court argued against the statute's constitutionality, the majority found that the issue was not properly before the court.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect;. 14:67(B)(1). Defendant pleaded guilty to theft, and to being a second-felony habitual offender. He was sentenced to 18 months at hard labor by the Criminal District Court of Orleans Parish, Louisiana. Defendant appealed the conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim informed the officer that parts to his truck were at defendant's residence. Defendant advised officers that he had taken a truck bed cover off an abandoned truck. Defendant took the officers into his backyard and showed them the truck cover. They arrested him for possession of stolen property. On appeal, defendant framed his argument as one directed to intent. Defendant believed the truck was abandoned. Viewing all of the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant took the bed cover, valued at $ 300 or more, but less than $ 500, that he knew it belonged to another, without the other's consent, with an intent to permanently deprive the other person of the bed cover. As to defendant's sentence, the trial court only learned after imposing the sentence that defendant had been undergoing chemotherapy, and that he needed to be tested periodically to determine if leukemia was still in remission. Defendant had a valid argument that placing defendant in prison for one and one half years might be disproportionate to his actions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant pled guilty and the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, sentenced defendant to five years at hard labor, without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 16 when he committed the crime. The trial court stated that it was deviating from the minimum mandatory sentence due to defendant's age, that this was his first conviction, and that he had a great deal of support from his family. The State argued that the trial court abused its discretion in imposing a sentence of five years' incarceration at hard labor for the crime of armed robbery where the mandatory minimum sentence was 10 years' incarceration at hard labor. The State contended that the facts of the case did not support the imposition of a sentence below the 10 year minimum penalty provided in La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14:64, and that the trial court failed to provide a sufficient basis for the downward departure. The instant court agreed and noted that the absence of violent offenses and defendant's age could not be the basis for a downward departure from the minimum sentence. As the State was not part of the sentencing agreement, defendant could withdraw his guilty plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence was vacated. The case was remanded to the trial court for further proceeding, reserving to defendant the right to withdraw his guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of possession of crack cocaine and sentenced to two years' imprisonment. Thereafter, the State filed a multiple bill charging defendant as a fourth felony offender under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 and he was sentenced to life imprisonment without the trial court having first vacated the previously imposed term. Defendant's motions to reconsider the sentence and to quash the multiple bill were denied, and on appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress was proper because he was not seized when he was approached by police. When he dropped a bag with drugs in it, it was an abandonment thereof. Accordingly, suppression was not necessary. However, the court vacated his sentence, finding that there may have been extenuating circumstances which warranted a lesser sentence. Although &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1)(c)(ii) mandated life imprisonment, the court found that the trial court still had discretion to make a downward modification thereof in the event that such sentencing was constitutionally excessive. The failure to have vacated the prior sentence did not affect defendant's substantial rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction, but vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held the identification of the workers' compensation judge as the appropriate authority to impose the penalties under &sect; 23:1208(D) was the type of legislative intent required by La.

Insofar as La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1208(D) was concerned, subject matter jurisdiction was specifically assigned to the Louisiana Office of Workers' Compensation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured motorist brought an action against defendants, a tortfeasor, his insurer, and the motorist's uninsured/underinsured carrier, for damages relating to a car accident. After the insurer was declared insolvent, the motorist sought insurance benefits from defendant Louisiana Insurance Guaranty Association (LIGA). The Civil District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), dismissed the motorist's claims against LIGA. The motorist appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist's vehicle was hit in the rear by the tortfeasor. The motorist settled with her carrier for an amount less than the policy limits. The parties stipulated that the motorist's damages did not exceed those policy limits, and they further stipulated the amount to which the motorist was entitled in the event she was rendered a judgment against LIGA. The trial court ruled in favor of LIGA and found that it was constitutionally permissible to apply La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1386 (amended 1992) to the case at hand. On appeal, the motorist challenged the constitutionality of the statute's retroactive application. The court affirmed the ruling. The court noted that a previous opinion held that the statute could be constitutionally retroactively applied. In light of that case, the court made the same conclusion. Thus, the statute was applicable in this case. The motorist was only entitled to recover from LIGA to the extent that her damages exceeded the policy limits of other insurance. Because the motorist failed to exhaust her rights under the limits of her policy with her carrier, the trial court properly found in LIGA's favor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After denial of plaintiff lounge's application for a liquor license, the lounge filed an action seeking a writ of mandamus against defendant police jury. After a trial, the Twenty-Third Judicial District Court, Parish of Assumption (Louisiana), granted the police jury's exception of prescription and motion for partial summary judgment, and dismissed all of the lounge's claims. The lounge appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police jury met on January 13, 1999, and it amended its existing liquor ordinance to prohibit a barroom within 500 feet of a church. On January 27, 1999, the police jury denied the lounge's application for a liquor license. The lounge's owners were present at the January 27, 1999, meeting. The lounge filed suit on March 29, 1999, contending that the police jury violated provisions of the Open Meetings Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:4.1 et seq., and that the amended ordinance was unconstitutional. The appellate court found that: (1) the lounge's challenge of the police jury's finding that they could not issue a liquor license under the amended ordinance was untimely, as the lounge owner's were present at the meeting, they had notice on January 27, 1999, that the license was denied, and they failed to file the lounge's action within 10 days after the denial under the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:106; and (2) the lounge lost the right to attack the amended ordinance on the ground that it violated the Open Meetings Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:4.1 et seq., by failing to file suit within 60 days of January 13, 1999, as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42.9.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an employer and an insurer, challenged a decision of the Nineteenth Judicial District, State of Louisiana, Parish of East Baton Rouge, which found in favor of appellee employee in his workers' compensation case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured in the course of his employment, and he received medical treatment without the employer's aid. He later filed a form reporting his injury, and he was recommended to receive temporary total benefits. Thereafter, the employee filed this action to compel the employer and insurer to pay total and permanent disability benefits, together with penalties. The benefits to the employee were first paid as requested, then reduced and terminated. The trial court found that the employer and insurer arbitrarily reduced and terminated the compensation payments to the employee. The court affirmed on appeal. Although not raised on appeal, the court considered the issue of subject matter jurisdiction and held that the claim was governed in accordance with 1989 La. Acts 260, and the trial court had jurisdiction. Given that there was no medical substantiation for a reduction in benefits to the employee, the trial court had a reasonable basis for finding that the employee was entitled to receive total temporary disability payments. The trial court did not err in refusing to admit the employee's entire personnel file from another job because it was not shown to be relevant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of distribution of cocaine, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967A. He was subsequently found to have been a third felony offender and was sentenced under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 to 25 years. The 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Division &quot;I&quot; from &quot;S&quot; (Louisiana), denied defendant's appeal. Defendant appealed and claimed his enhanced sentence was unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued his 25-year enhanced sentence was excessive, because, in the 5 years that he was in prison prior to his resentencing, he rehabilitated himself through the various courses offered in prison. He pointed to several substance abuse, life-saving, and religious courses he completed while in prison. He also noted that he was currently enrolled in a GED program. Defendant was a third felony offender. His prior convictions included possession of cocaine and possession of stolen property. In his most recent conviction, defendant's level of crime progressed to distribution of cocaine. The appellate court found that an adequate factual basis for the trial court's imposition of a 25-year sentence existed. Defendant argued 25 years was excessive in light of his non-violent record. However, a defendant's record of non-violent offenses was not the sole reason or even the major reason for declaring a sentence excessive. Violent offenses had already been taken into account under the Habitual Offender Law for third and fourth offenders, which punished third and fourth offenders with a history of violent offenses more severely than those with a history of non-violent offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with second degree battery on his estranged wife, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:34.1. He pled not guilty. A six-person jury in the 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Division &quot;G&quot; (Louisiana), found defendant guilty as charged, and he was sentenced to four years imprisonment at hard labor. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence and asserted, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant also asserted that the trial judge erred in admitting Prieur evidence and that the sentence was excessive. Defendant contended that the state failed to prove that his estranged wife's injuries were sufficient to constitute &quot;serious bodily injury,&quot; as intended by the second-degree battery statute. However, inter alia, defendant choked her, shoved her across the bed, and kicked her. She could not breathe and thought she was going to die. As defendant continued to choke her, she felt her neck &quot;crackle,&quot; she &quot;blacked out,&quot; and she was in jeopardy of losing her life. When defendant finally released her, she still had difficulty breathing. He then beat her about the head and face. Defendant's actions left marks on her neck that were observed by a deputy the following day. Those injuries were sufficiently serious to have risen to the level of second degree battery. The trial judge had not abused his discretion in admitting the evidence of other crimes. The record supported the sentence imposed. Defendant was a chronic abuser who did not think his actions were aberrant. He testified that he attended an anger management class, but only after being ordered by a judge to do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction and sentence were affirmed, and the case was remanded so that the trial judge could, within 10 days of the rendering of the appellate opinion, send written notice of the prescriptive period for post-conviction relief to defendant, and then to file written proof in the record that defendant received the notice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence for distribution of cocaine within 1000 feet of an elementary school, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:981.3. The 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Division &quot;C&quot; (Louisiana), found him to be a second felony offender. The court vacated the original sentence and sentenced defendant under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 to imprisonment at hard labor for 60 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised issues on appeal, inter alia, regarding sufficiency of the evidence, erroneous admission of evidence, and his sentence. He argued that his counsel was ineffective for failing to timely file a motion for post verdict judgment of acquittal, where the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction. He argued that the state failed to prove he knowingly or intentionally distributed cocaine. The state produced the testimony of a police officer, which proved that defendant voluntarily delivered or physically transferred the cocaine when he handed the drugs to an undercover officer. Guilty knowledge of the cocaine at the time of transfer was shown when defendant handed two crack cocaine rocks to the officer. The exact identity of the cocaine had been stipulated to. The drug transaction was videotaped and played for the judge. The undercover officer identified defendant in a photographic lineup and testified that the transaction occurred one block away from the school. The appellate court held that the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knowingly or intentionally distributed cocaine within 1000 feet of a school.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed, and the case was remanded for a ruling on the motion to reconsider the sentence, for the trial court to send the appropriate written notice to defendant regarding the prescriptive period for post-conviction relief, and to file written proof in the record that he received the notice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted before the 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, on a charge of distribution of cocaine within 1000 feet of the playground, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:981.3. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A narcotics agent was driving an unmarked patrol car near a playground. A woman came to the car, and the agent asked the woman if she could purchase some drugs. The woman told the officer to drive around the block, but, before the officer could, defendant asked the officer what she wanted. Defendant gave the woman cocaine, which she handed to the officer in exchange for money. The transaction took place approximately 250 feet from the playground. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial judge improperly denied his motion to quash and motion for new trial because the State failed to establish that the playground was school property as defined by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:981.3(C)(2). Nevertheless, defendant never raised this issue before the trial court. The appellate court found that defendant's chief complaint was that the evidence was insufficient. At trial, the officer described the drug-free zone sign, and this testimony was uncontested. Finally, in its patent error review, the appellate court determined that it would not correct the illegally lenient sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant father appealed a judgment from the Fifteenth Judicial District, Parish of Lafayette (Louisiana), which changed the visitation schedule between the father and plaintiff mother regarding their child and the mother's daughter from a previous marriage from &quot;seven and seven&quot; physical sharing to every other weekend. The father claimed error in awarding visitation rights for the daughter to her biological paternal grandmother and her husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found no manifest error in modifying the physical custody schedule from a &quot;seven and seven&quot; schedule to every other weekend visitations. The &quot;seven and seven&quot; physical custody schedule was not intended to be a permanent custody arrangement and due to continuances, the plan was in effect much longer than originally intended. Previously the physical custody schedule in effect was a more traditional every other weekend arrangement with additional visitation in the middle of the week. The language of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:344(B) showed a clear preference by the legislature to ensure a child's contact with biological family members, regardless of the marital status of the child's parents. Therefore, the father's contention that the daughter was not a child of the marriage between the mother and her first husband was without merit, and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:344 was the applicable statute. In light of the grandmother's past contact with the granddaughter, as well as her substantial economic support for the past several years, there was no error in the determination that it was in the granddaughter's best interest to ensure her continued contact with the grandmother.</SPAN></P>

After the insurer was declared insolvent, the motorist sought insurance benefits from defendant Louisiana Insurance Guaranty Association (LIGA). The Civil District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), dismissed the motorist's claims against LIGA. The motorist appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist's vehicle was hit in the rear by the tortfeasor. The motorist settled with her carrier for an amount less than the policy limits. The parties stipulated that the motorist's damages did not exceed those policy limits, and they further stipulated the amount to which the motorist was entitled in the event she was rendered a judgment against LIGA. The trial court ruled in favor of LIGA and found that it was constitutionally permissible to apply La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1386 (amended 1992) to the case at hand. On appeal, the motorist challenged the constitutionality of the statute's retroactive application. The court affirmed the ruling. The court noted that a previous opinion held that the statute could be constitutionally retroactively applied. In light of that case, the court made the same conclusion. Thus, the statute was applicable in this case. The motorist was only entitled to recover from LIGA to the extent that her damages exceeded the policy limits of other insurance. Because the motorist failed to exhaust her rights under the limits of her policy with her carrier, the trial court properly found in LIGA's favor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his first assignment of error, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying him the right to present evidence of the victim's accusation and subsequent denial of prior sexual activity with her biological brother. Defendant further submitted that the trial court's failure to allow him to present such evidence was not harmless error. Defendant attempted to present evidence to show that the victim made prior false statements concerning sexual activity between herself and her biological brother. The appellate court held that two requirements had to be satisfied before evidence of prior sexual activity could be admitted for impeachment purposes, assuming the evidence was otherwise admissible. First, the activity had to have been of a sexual nature. Second, there had to have been evidence the statement was false. The appellate court found that the trial court properly applied State v. Smith and did not err in ruling the evidence concerning sexual behavior between the victim and her brother inadmissible. Furthermore, the trial court did not err in ruling that there was insufficient admissible evidence that the victim made false allegations regarding sexual activities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant department of revenue challenged the award by the 19th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), of attorney fees to appellee attorneys who represented plaintiffs. The award was based upon the &quot;fund doctrine&quot; or &quot;common fund doctrine.&quot; The attorneys in turn requested 35 percent of the common fund, rather than the 28 percent award ordered by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorneys' claim for an attorney fee award was properly raised and properly considered by the trial court. The assignment of error lacked merit. The appellate court held that the fund doctrine was applicable under the facts and circumstances of the case at bar. The efforts of the attorneys clearly resulted in the creation, preservation, protection, and increase in the settlement fund for the benefit of all taxpayer beneficiaries. But for the actions of the attorneys, no fund would have been created for the non-party beneficiaries to receive a refund of state sales taxes paid on manufactured and mobile home purchases. Accordingly, the appellate court found no error by the trial court in its conclusion that the fund doctrine was applicable and entitled the attorneys to a fee from the fund. Given the vast amount of work performed by the attorneys over the course of six years as well as the skill, ingenuity, and diligence resulting in the creation, preservation, and increase of the fund, the appellate court was unable to say the trial court abused its discretion in awarding a fee of 28 percent of the Settlement Fund. The appellate court, however, declined to change that award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. Costs of the appeal were assessed against the state through the department.</SPAN></P>

Reversing the trial court's judgment, the court held that the hospital had not violated the Open Meetings Law. The complainant then instituted an action seeking a declaration that the core provisions of the Enhanced Ability to Compete Act violated La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 3. The trial court held that the Act was constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The right to observe the deliberations of public bodies and examine public documents was not an inalienable individual right. The Legislature could exempt from disclosure any information it wished. The Act was a permissible exercise of legislative power. Because the right was not a fundamental, inalienable constitutional right, the substantial overbreadth doctrine was not applicable. The complainant failed to rebut the strong presumption in favor of the Act's constitutionality. The Act did not violate the complainant's rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen had previously been convicted for aggravated rape and burglary. He filed his declaratory action, arguing under the former version of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 413(B) in effect at the time of his conviction called for the trial court to select one person from the grand jury venire to serve as the foreman of the grand jury. The citizen contended the statute was unconstitutional due to the alleged racially discriminatory method of selecting grand jury foremen. The appellate court initially noted although couched in terms of a prayer for declaratory relief, the citizen's request was nothing more than an effort to obtain a reversal of his conviction based upon the alleged illegality of the previous La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 413(B). The appellate court admonished declaratory judgment was unavailable to test the constitutionality of a repealed criminal statute and a resulting conviction. The appellate court held the citizen waived his right to complain because he failed to assert an equal protection claim regarding the composition of grand juries in a pre-trial motion to quash at his trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Fifteenth Judicial District Court, Paris of Lafayette (Louisiana), after she was tried by a jury and found guilty of second degree murder; a sentence of life imprisonment at hard labor was imposed, without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence; and her motion to reconsider sentence was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon arrival to investigate a domestic disturbance, police found the victim lying dead on the bedroom floor, with a substantial amount of blood on his shoulder and a large knife lying nearby. Defendant admitted that she stabbed the victim, and gave a videotaped statement, during which she conflicting accounts of the events leading up to the crime. The appellate court held that: (1) the State submitted sufficient evidence to prove that defendant did not act in self-defense, as the murder scene did not show any signs of a violent physical confrontation, defendant had physically the victim on several prior occasions, and it was unnecessary to kill the victim under any of the scenarios offered by defendant; (2) based on the evidence, the jury did not err in rejecting defendant's claim that she acted in the heat of passion; (3) prosecution of defendant, following a mistrial, did not violate double jeopardy, because prosecutorial error was unintentional and defendant suffered no prejudice; and (4) the record contained no evidence which the trial court could have reviewed to determine that the mandatory life sentence was constitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant had been arrested for obstruction of justice and false personation of a peace officer. He filed a motion in the Ninth Judicial District Court, Rapides Parish (Louisiana), in which he prayed that his felony arrest records be expunged and destroyed. The State did not oppose the request for expungement but opposed the destruction request. The trial court ultimately ordered the expungement and destruction of the records. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court first noted that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:9 provided for the expungement of felony arrest records in particularized instances, but it did not provide for the destruction of felony arrest records. The appellate court then quoted La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:9(G) in finding that expungement meant removal of a record from public access but did not mean destruction of the record. The appellate court held that the trial court's grant of movant's request for destruction of his felony arrest records was a misapplication of the law. Movant alternatively sought a judgment declaring that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:9's provision for the destruction of misdemeanor arrest records, but not felony arrest records, was unconstitutional. In his rule to modify judgment on rule or, alternatively, petition for declaratory judgment, he requested service on the Louisiana Attorney General, but there was no evidence in the record that service was made. Without proof of notice of service on the attorney general, the issue of the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:9 was not properly before the appellate court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court ordering the destruction of movant's felony arrest records was reversed. The issue of service on the Louisiana Attorney General regarding movant's challenge to the constitutionality of the expungement statute was remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Tenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Natchitoches (Louisiana), which convicted him of vehicular homicide, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:32.1 and sentenced him to 15 years at hard labor, and convicted him of vehicular negligent injuring, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:39.1 and sentenced him to 6 months in the detention center.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for vehicular homicide and vehicular negligent injuring. He appealed, and the court affirmed both of his convictions, but vacated his sentence for vehicular homicide, finding that it was indeterminate. The trial court imposed an indeterminate sentence when it ordered that &quot;at least&quot; five years of defendant's sentence for vehicular homicide be served without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. The sentencing provision for vehicular homicide required that at least one year of the sentence be served without probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. Thus, the trial court could order all or a portion, but at least one year, of the sentence to be served without benefits, but it must have specified the term. Further, in addition to being indeterminate, the sentence for vehicular homicide was illegally lenient. The failure to access defendant with a fine and order him into a court-approved program provided additional grounds for vacating the sentence. Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel argument failed, because it should be relegated to post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and his sentence for vehicular negligent injuring. The court vacated his sentence for vehicular homicide and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of Rapides (Louisiana), found defendant city liable to plaintiff injured party, who alleged that she was raped by a trustee, a prison inmate, while working for the city doing community service work. The city appealed. The injured party answered the city's appeal seeking an increase in the award of damages and claiming that the trial court erred in dismissing her 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party was sentenced to perform community service. While performing community service, the injured party was raped by a trustee who was incarcerated at a parish detention center. The city and the parish detention center had entered into an agreement for the use of inmates outside of the detention facility. In the agreement, the city agreed to supervise a trustee when a trustee was working for the city. The trial court found that the injured party was raped and that the city was responsible for her resulting injuries and awarded her special and general damages. The appellate court found that had the city simply never allowed the trustee and the injured party to be alone together, the rape would never have occurred. Therefore, the city was 70 percent at fault and the trustee was 30 percent at fault. Also, the city's actions were grossly negligent. Thus, the city was responsible for any general damages in addition to medical expenses. Additionally, the trial court's award of damages was appropriate. However, the injured party failed to prove a claim for damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and her claim was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court modified the trial court's judgment insofar as it failed to allocate fault to the trustee who raped the injured party and reduced fault as to the city based on the allocation of fault to the trustee. In all other respects, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed. Costs of the appeal were assessed to the city.</SPAN></P>

The matters were consolidated on appeal. The appellate court found that: (1) the inmate's &quot;tort&quot; claims arose directly from the disciplinary and administrative remedy proceedings of the department of corrections and not from an independent accident; (2) the corrections administrative remedy procedure was not unconstitutional when applied to injuries from prison confinement; (3) LA. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1177(A) required the inmate to seek judicial review of any adverse administrative remedy decision in the nineteenth judicial district court within 30 days of receipt of the adverse decision; and (4) both of the district courts properly sustained the exceptions of prematurity and lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Defendant admitted the allegations, the two year sentence was vacated, and the five year sentence was imposed. Defendant argued that her guilty plea should have been set aside, because she was erroneously advised that she was pleading guilty to a felony, and she was later advised that an amendment to the statute under which she was charged made the offense a misdemeanor. The appellate court ruled that defendant's contention that her conviction and multiple offender adjudication and sentence should be set aside because they resulted from involuntary guilty plea was unfounded. Defendant admitted culpability to access device fraud in exchange for a two-year sentence. The sentence was legal within the language of former La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:70.4 (E), as that statute existed at the time of defendant's offense.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Section &quot;L&quot; (Louisiana), after he was convicted, following a mistrial, of possession of cocaine in an amount 28 grams or more, but less than 200 grams, and was adjudicated a second-felony habitual offender and sentenced to 30 years at hard labor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two police officers arrested defendant after they saw him engage in a hand-to-hand transaction with another individual near a store. On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction, and that his sentence was constitutionally excessive. The appellate court held that any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was a seller of crack cocaine, as defendant offered no evidence that the substance was not cocaine to rebut the State's evidence, and the record contained evidence that two police officers observed defendant engage in a hand-to-hand transaction and one officer observed the individual hand defendant currency and defendant hand a white object to the individual. However, the trial court erred regarding sentencing insofar as it believed that it was barred by law from considering the dramatic reductions in sentences for drug offenses effected by 2001 La. Acts 403, &sect; 4, as a palliative factor when assessing the reasonableness of defendant's sentence under the Dorthey standard. To the contrary, the legislature's subsequent changes in criminal statutes were relevant sentencing considerations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a sales tax assessment case, the Fourteenth Judicial District, Parish of Calcasieu, Division &quot;H&quot; (Louisiana), denied plaintiff rental company's motion for summary judgment and granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of defendant, the Director of Calcasieu Parish Sales and Use Tax Department (Louisiana). The trial court subsequently reduced the penalty percentage owed by the rental company. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rental company was audited by the Department and was assessed sales and use taxes for its leased cranes. The rental company protested the assessment, but it was denied. The rental company paid, under protest, the Department's final assessment, but filed a petition for refund to recover the amounts, essentially arguing that the cranes were excluded from taxation. The rental company appealed the trial court's denial of its motion for summary judgment and motion for new trial regarding the impropriety of the taxation. The Department appealed that portion of the motion for new trial which was granted by the trial court reducing the penalty percentage owed by the rental company. The appellate court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:301(10)(a)(iii) and (18)(a)(iii) were constitutional. Thus, the Department properly assessed the rental company with its local use tax. Also, the appellate court had to reverse the trial court's judgment regarding the imposition of attorney's fees since the amount awarded would cause the combined interest, penalty, and attorney's fees to exceed the 15 percent penalty permitted by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2746.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The summary judgment granted in favor of the Director finding that the rental company was subject to a sales and use tax and was not entitled to a credit was affirmed. The trial court's judgment was reversed regarding the amount of penalties. On remand, the combined interest, penalty, and attorney's fee award could not to exceed 15 percent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of three counts of armed robbery and sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment at hard labor as to each count. The convictions and sentences were affirmed. The State filed a multiple bill, charging him as a third felony offender and the Criminal District Court for Orleans Parish (Louisiana) resentenced him to 66 years at hard labor on count three under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1)(b)(i) (2001). The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's third felony, armed robbery, was a crime of violence. His prior offenses were simple robbery, carrying a concealed weapon second offense, and first-degree robbery, which was a crime of violence. On the date that defendant was charged, former La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1)(b) (2000) was in effect. The trial court deliberately sentenced the defendant to a lesser term under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1)(b) (2001). The appellate court found that: (1) the trial court erred in sentencing defendant to the 66 year sentence rather than life imprisonment because the amendments to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 (2001) became effective after defendant committed his most recent offense; (2) La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, the habitual offender statute, was constitutional; and (3) imposition of a life sentence was not constitutionally excessive because nothing in the record or the facts suggested any mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentenced imposed by the criminal district court was vacated and the matter was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a suit by plaintiffs, 35 coroners, against defendant, the State of Louisiana, seeking past due and future extra compensation allegedly owed them, the 19th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), overruled the State's peremptory exception raising the objection of no cause of action, granted the coroners motion for summary judgment, and awarded each coroner the specific amount due him or her. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Commencing with the 1986-1987 fiscal year, the legislative branch failed and/or refused to appropriate funds for the coroners' extra compensation. Further, the legislative branch failed, refused, and/or was unable to amend La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1559 by which it created the State's obligation to pay the extra compensation to the coroners.  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1559A and B imposed a mandatory obligation on the State to pay extra compensation to the coroners (1) until La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1559 was repealed, (2) the money was paid, or (3) the terms for which the coroners were elected expire, whichever came later. Pursuant to La. Const. art. I, &sect; 22 and the Louisiana Civil Code, substantive remedies available to the coroners were specific performance, La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1986 et seq., or dissolution and damages, La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2013 et seq. The coroners chose specific performance. The failure to pay the compensation owed to the coroners breached the contract between the State and the coroners. Thus, the trial court properly awarded the coroners the amounts due to them for past due compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The State was cast for the costs of the appeal.</SPAN></P>

Several times the case was appealed to the Louisiana Supreme Court and remanded to the trial court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, lesbian and gay civil organization and several lesbian and gay citizens, sued defendants, State of Louisiana, attorney general, and parish district attorney, the latter both individually and as the class representative of all of the Louisiana prosecutors. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Louisiana Crime Against Nature statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:89, and several statutes extending its effects, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 12:1041, 15:535, 15:536, 15:538, 15:540, 15:542, 15:542.1, 15:543, 15:544, 15:545, and 15:549 were unconstitutional. The appellate court held that the discriminatory purpose by the lawmaking body was not proven and no evidence was introduced that the entire legislative body enacted the statutes for the purpose of discriminating against gay men and lesbians. As such, the statutes were not unconstitutional on equal protection grounds. After considering the evidence and law, the appellate court found no error in the trial judge's ruling that there was insufficient evidence to hold that the targeted statutes provided for cruel, unusual, and excessive punishment. Also, the targeted statutes were not bills of attainder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment as amended. The appellate court amended the original judgment to read that plaintiffs were dismissed with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Approximately 18 years after receiving the blood transfusions, the patient was diagnosed with the hepatitis C virus, and the patient was told by doctors that it was likely due to the blood transfused. The patient argued that an action in strict product liability arising out of a defective blood transfusion was not within the scope of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628. The patient asserted that the action did not prescribe in three years from the date of the transfusion in cases where the harm from the transfusion was discovered beyond the three years. The appellate court ruled that the patient's claims of strict liability were not prescribed and the trial court was wrong in so ruling. All claims made against the hospital in strict product liability arising out of defective blood transfusions that arose before the blood shield statutes enacted in 1982 were governed by La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 3492 and not La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A bill of information was filed charging defendant with fifth-offense operating a vehicle while intoxicated (DWI), in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:98E. The 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Division &quot;P&quot; (Louisiana), found defendant guilty as charged. Defendant moved for a new trial, which the court denied. He was sentenced to 10 years at hard labor. Defendant filed a notice of intent to appeal, which was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the State failed to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Specifically, he asserted that the evidence was insufficient to show he was legally intoxicated and that the prosecution failed to prove he was the same person who was convicted of the prior DWI offenses. At trial, a police corporal testified that defendant was exceeding the speed limit, although he was not driving erratically, and that several factors, which were evident after he stopped defendant for speeding, led him to conclude that defendant was intoxicated. When defendant exited his car, he swayed and grabbed the side of the car to steady himself. When defendant walked toward the corporal after exiting his car he staggered. Defendant smelled strongly of alcohol, and his speech was slurred. The appellate court's review of the record supported the trial judge's determination that defendant was legally intoxicated and guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of operating a vehicle while intoxicated. And, when viewed in its entirety, the record supported the sentence imposed and that the entire term was to have been served without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction and sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One truck driver was killed and his fellow driver was severely injured when their tractor trailer rolled over. Appellees, their wives, brought suit against appellant Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD). A jury in the 19th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), awarded damages to the wives. Inter alia, the court granted the DOTD a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV). Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One issue on appeal was whether the highway was an unreasonably dangerous one; defective by inadequate warnings and in design. The Federal Aid Highway Act (FAHA), 23 U.S.C.S. &sect; 101 et seq., standards did not attempt to supersede the prohibition in state law against negligent acts of design, construction, or signage or imposition of strict liability. The appellate court saw no error in the trial court's denial of the summary judgment on the issue of preemption. Based on credibility determinations, the judge found that there was not sufficient evidence that the driver was impaired at the time of the accident. The court's conclusion served as the basis for the trial judge's grant of the motion to exclude the DOTD's experts' testimony regarding marijuana and grant of the partial summary judgment dismissing the affirmative defense of the driver's negligence in driving under the influence of marijuana. It was error for the judge to have based his ruling not on the evidentiary articles and law governing admissibility, but on his own credibility decisions and choice of expert opinions. However, the inclusion of the rejected evidence could not have permissibly changed the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The JNOV was reversed and the jury's award for the survival action was reinstated, the amount of damages awarded was amended, and as amended, the judgment was affirmed in part. The costs of the appeal were assessed as one-half to the wives and one-half to the DOTD.</SPAN></P>

The sheriff, deputy and warden filed an exception of failure to exhaust the administrative remedies, which was granted by the 19th Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana). The prisoner's suit was dismissed and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner asserted on appeal that the Corrections Administrative Remedy Procedure (CARP), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:1171-1179, was unconstitutional as applied to tort suits, and thus the district court erred in dismissing his suit under an unconstitutional statute. The appellate court found that: (1) the prisoner was able to raise the unconstitutionality of the statute for the first time on appeal because the statute was declared unconstitutional in another case; (2) the sheriff's administrative procedure was not distinguishable from the department of corrections' administrative procedure; (3) the CARP administrative procedure was unconstitutional as applied to tort suits because it conflicted with La. Const. art. V, &sect; 16(A), in that it attempted to divest the district courts of jurisdiction over prisoner's tort claims; and (4) it was error for the district court to dismiss the prisoner's tort suit for failure to follow the unconstitutional procedure set forth in CARP.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Louisiana Office of Workers' Compensation (OWC) entered judgment against appellant employee, and in favor of appellee employer and the appellee insurer, and awarded damages. The employee filed another petition claiming the OWC had no jurisdiction to award money damages. The Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Ouachita, Louisiana, granted the employer's and the insurer's exceptions. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee claimed to have injured his back on his first day of work for the employer, and obtained medical treatment paid for by workers' compensation. The employee reported no previous injuries, but it was discovered the employee had suffered a back injury in a department store. The current provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1310.3(F) were not in effect at the time of the employee's initial claim for benefits or at the time he filed his petition in district court. Without regard to the retroactivity of these provisions, however, the employee did not attempt to litigate the constitutional issue in the proceedings that led to his first appeal. The gist of the argument in the appeal was that the OWC had no jurisdiction to award money damages except in awarding compensation benefits. The appellate court concluded, however, that the challenge to the OWC's jurisdiction and to the constitutionality of the statutes enabling the OWC to enter the awards, including his action challenging the subsequent award for damages for investigation and litigation, was barred by operation of La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 2005.</SPAN></P>

The doctors pled the peremptory exception of prescription, which the trial court granted. The parents appealed, arguing the retroactive application of a holding that party who improperly filed a premature medical malpractice suit without first filing the claim with the board for a medical review panel, and whose suit was subsequently dismissed without prejudice, gained an additional year in prescription in addition to the suspended time provided by the Louisiana Medical Malpractice Act, within which to file suit anew violated their constitutionally protected interests.

The Civil District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, denied motions to consolidate and to declare La. Code Civ. Proc. Art. ann. 971&nbsp;unconstitutional. The parties cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found no constitutional flaw with the construction of the article. The second and most important constitutional issue before the appellate court was whether art. 971 violated the Equal Protection Clause. The appellate court found the constitutional challenges made were without merit. The abuse of rights doctrine could not be invoked. Malice was not proven because there was only conjecture presented that the articles and newscasts were published for the sole purpose of generating profits and to depict the public servant in a bad light. As to the public servant's argument regarding racial profiling, Louisiana law did not recognize a cause of action for racial profiling in the media.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the judgment in part, as to the trial court's denial of the motion to consolidate and the granting of the special motion to strike. The appellate court reversed, however, as to the trial court's failure to award reasonable attorney fees and costs. The matter was remanded.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its review for errors patent, the appellate court found that the trial court failed to observe the mandatory 24 hour delay between the denial of a motion for new trial and sentencing, and defendant did not waive the delay. Because defendant alleged the trial court imposed an excessive sentence, the sentence had to be vacated and the case remanded for resentencing. Defendant argued the trial court erred in permitting an officer to testify about the search performed by another officer, due to the original officer's unavailability. The testifying officer stated that he saw his partner search defendant's vehicle under the driver's seat and place the items he found on the roof of the vehicle. Additionally, defendant's counsel was made aware of the officer's absence prior to the commencement of the defendant's trial. Defendant's counsel did not object to proceeding to trial because of the officer's absence. The sentencing range for defendant as a fourth felony offender was 20 years to life. Defendant's 22 and 1/2 years sentence was within the lower range of the sentencing scale. The sentence imposed was not grossly out of proportion.</SPAN></P>

In addition, there was testimony that defendant was not a threat to others and was not mentally ill. The appellate court found that: (1) a sentence of eight years was not warranted when considering the maximum penalties for aggravated assault and the degree of culpability of the defendant's actions; and (2) sentencing defendant to eight years was excessive, given the circumstances; the sentence shocked the appellate court's sense of justice and was grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for first degree robbery several times. The 16th Judicial District Court, Parish of Iberia (Louisiana), sentenced defendant to 30 years at hard labor and denied his request for an out-of-time appeal, stating that he waived his right to an appeal by failing to timely file a motion to reconsider the sentence. On remand, the trial court granted leave to file an out-of-time appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, defendant claimed that the trial court erred, as the 30 year sentence imposed for first degree robbery was unconstitutionally excessive for a fourth felony offender who never committed a crime with a weapon. As a preliminary matter, the appellate court noted defendant failed to timely file a motion to reconsider his sentence, as required by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881.1(A), and, as a general rule, appellate courts were precluded from reviewing a sentence when a defendant failed to timely file such a motion. However, because defendant appeared to raise the issue of ineffective counsel in his pro se assignment of error, the appellate court reviewed the sentence. The 30-year sentence was clearly within the statutory limit. Before imposing sentence, the trial court received a pre-sentence investigation report that showed defendant was a fourth-felony offender and included a number of other charges that never became convictions. The appellate court found that the trial court did not abuse its wide discretion in sentencing defendant, and the trial court articulated the factors, both aggravating and mitigating, it considered before rendering the sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant injured worker appealed a judgment of the Office of Workers' Compensation, District 02, Parish of Rapides (Louisiana) (OWC). The worker claimed that her manager had falsely testified that the worker was a part-time employee. OWC dismissed, on its own motion, the worker's claim of employer fraud under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1208 on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues on appeal were whether the OWC had subject matter jurisdiction to consider claims of misrepresentation under &sect; 23:1208, and whether &sect; 23:1208 was constitutional. The appellate court held that &sect; 23:1208 was beyond the scope of the powers and authority granted to the OWC, an executive branch office. The appellate court declared &sect; 23:1208&nbsp;unconstitutional pursuant to La. Const. arts. 5, &sect;&sect; 1, &sect; 16; 2, &sect; 2. In accordance with the constitutional provisions, the workers' compensation judge properly recognized that he lacked the authority to review a claim of fraudulent misrepresentation. La. Const. art. 5, &sect; 16, limited the scope of the power and authority of an administrative tribunal like the OWC. If the employer had been found in violation of the statute, then the employer would also have been subject to criminal penalties under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1208(C). Imposition of such a penalty was clearly a judicial branch, not an executive branch, prerogative. Undertaking such action infringed upon powers specifically delegated to the judiciary and violated the Louisiana Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant demoted state police officer appealed a decision rendered by the State Police Commission, East Baton Rouge Parish (Louisiana), that upheld his demotion by the department of public safety and corrections, office of state police (SP), for, inter alia, failure to report off-duty traffic details. The demoted officer also appealed the commission's decision that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain his appeal of an annual performance rating.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer was demoted for violating SP Procedural Orders, as he failed to submit the paperwork for 30 off-duty traffic details he worked over a 2 year period. As a supervisor, the officer was expected to set an example. The commission found he had not done so, and, considering all of his violations, it concluded he should not have served in a supervisory position and upheld his demotion. The parties stipulated the officer had not reported the income he earned from the details on his income tax return. The appellate court held that all of the versions of Procedural Order 306 clearly and unambiguously covered off-duty personnel conducting &quot;traffic control&quot; at special events. The violation was established. The revision, which specifically added the words &quot;traffic details&quot; to the listing set out in Procedural Order 306, merely added another item to an illustrative list. Accordingly, the commission based its disciplinary decision on legal cause and did not abuse its discretion by imposing a punishment on the officer. The officer's &quot;needs improvement&quot; rating was not discriminatory, was not a removal or disciplinary claim, and the commission lacked jurisdiction over that issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a divorce, appellant mother was subsequently granted sole custody of her child, and appellees, the paternal grandparents, were granted limited visitation, with the requirement they not allow contact between the child and the incarcerated father. Later, the 22nd Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of Washington (Louisiana) granted the grandparents additional summer visitation. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In post-divorce proceedings, the trial court had granted the mother sole custody of the child after the mother alleged that the father had a recent history of criminal sexual abuse and was incarcerated in Utah. After filing two rules for contempt against the mother for allegedly frustrating their visitation rights, the grandparents sought a modification, and obtained an additional one week of summer visitation. The appellate court cited a recent United States Supreme Court decision which rejected any visitation scheme that trampled upon the sacred and paramount rights of a fit parent to dictate the best interests of his or her children. When a parent was incarcerated, as here, the grandparents were relieved of showing extraordinary circumstance to obtain visitation, but they nevertheless had to show that the requested visitation was in the &quot;best interest&quot; of the child. The burden of proof was on the grandparents. Visitation that unduly burdened parental rights would be unconstitutional, regardless of the provisions of statutory law. The appellate court held that by improperly placing the burden on the mother and using the wrong analysis, the trial court fell into reversible error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">judgment mandating summer visitation is reversed. The matter is remanded to the trial court for reevaluation of its decision in light of this opinion. Upon rendering a new judgment on the issue of additional, visitation to the grandparents, the court must provide an articulation of the court's analysis and reasons for its decision.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 51:1160, as amended, to be unconstitutional and ordering the city to distribute any and all future PILOT money under the store's agreement to the board and to all other tax recipient bodies of the city. Ultimately, the trial court entered judgment in favor of the city, and the board challenged the decision. The court of appeal held that: (1) the trial court did not err in granting the city's motion for summary judgment, since there existed no genuine issues of material fact concerning the lack of authorization of the amendment to the PILOT agreement; (2) the trial court did not err in failing to declare La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:1160, as amended in 1972, unconstitutional, since that statute did not violate the provisions of La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 14(A); and (3) the trial court did not err in ruling that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2798.1 was applicable to the city's actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patients instituted medical malpractice actions against defendant health care providers, incidental to pending medical review panel inquiries. The parties sought supervisory review of the district court's ruling on discovery issues. The Louisiana Supreme Court effectively consolidated the separate cases, granted writ applications, and rendered an opinion directing that the issue be addressed in an opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two of the cases, the patients were served with interrogatories about the standard of care, which they refused to answer. In the first case, the patient gave a limited answer. In the second case, the patient answered that she was not an expert regarding the applicable medical standard. The patient refused to answer a second question. The common issue of the three cases concerned the sufficiency of the statement of material facts of the claim as presented to the medical review panel. In the third case, the claim did not list the particular injury or injuries suffered, or allege facts of causation linking injuries to the various unidentified actions of the physician. As such, the claim did not properly set forth a statement of the material facts. As to the first two cases, the process employed by the health care providers were faulty. First, there was no showing regarding any insufficiency in the claims to the Patient Compensation Fund. Further, the discovery in the non-judicial proceedings was not in keeping with the intended nature of the proceeding as described nor was discovery through written interrogatories expressly provided in the Medical Malpractice Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ruling of the district court was affirmed as to the third case. The trial court's ruling issuing a protective order and refusing to order answers to a written interrogatory was affirmed in the first case. In the second case, the trial court's ruling in ordering the patient to respond to written interrogatories was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections (the Department), applied for a rehearing, alleging the appeals court's original opinion was in error regarding its interpretation of the screening provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1188 as applied by the Louisiana district court in this case to dismiss petitioner inmate's claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed habeas relief should be granted to him under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 362(2), which allowed relief if his original custody was lawful, but by some subsequent act, omission, or event, had become unlawful. He contended the application of an allegedly unconstitutional statute to return him to custody on a parole violation was the act that had made his current custody unlawful. The appeals court concluded the inmate's argument was not one that could properly be raised through post-conviction habeas under article 362(2). The statute that he claimed was unconstitutional had never been declared unconstitutional. The triggering event--application of an unconstitutional statute--for a habeas corpus claim under article 362(2) had not occurred. The inmate's claim was initiated as a civil action seeking redress from a governmental entity. Because an alleged violation of a constitutionally protected right could be raised in a separate suit invoking the district court's original jurisdiction, the screening provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1188 were correctly applied, and the district court's judgment of dismissal was appropriate for appellate review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On rehearing, the judgment of the district court dismissing defendant's claims was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate filed suit against defendants, the prison warden, prison employees, and the department of corrections, seeking punitive and compensatory damages for injuries he allegedly suffered in connection with disciplinary proceedings. Prior to docketing, the Second Judicial District Court, Claiborne Parish, Louisiana, dismissed the inmate's suit. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The underlying action arose when one of the employees filed a disciplinary report against the inmate, allegedly in retaliation and out of anger after the inmate said he would bring charges against the employee for not allowing him to use the phone to report another employee. At a disciplinary proceeding, the inmate was found to have violated prison rules and was penalized and placed in isolation, which led to his initiating the instant action. In his petition, he alleged he suffered physical injuries from the time spent in isolation, as well as emotional distress and humiliation. On review, the appellate court found that since the inmate's complaint sought a remedy with respect to his conditions of confinement, he was required to seek judicial review of any administrative remedy decision in the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1177(A). As he did not, the trial court properly utilized the judicial screening provisions of the Corrections Administrative Remedy Procedure, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:1171, 15:1178, of the Prisoner's Litigation Reform Act to dismiss his claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals raised the same basic issue: whether the provisions of art.

The appellate court held that it did. The language of art. I, &sect; 10, was clear and unambiguous. None of the three candidates was eligible to qualify for elective office unless art. I, &sect; 10, could not have been applied to them: (1) because application would have been an illegal retroactive application under Louisiana law; (2) because the article's disqualifying language, effective November 5, 1998, amounted to an ex post facto law in violation of the U.S. Constitution; or (3) because the disqualifying language conflicted with other constitutional provisions so as to create ambiguity regarding its application. While the appellate court agreed that the amendment to art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by bill of information with possession with the intent to distribute cocaine and entered a plea of not guilty at his arraignment. The Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Section &quot;L&quot; (Louisiana), denied defendant's motions to suppress evidence and for a new trial. Defendant was adjudicated to be a third felony offender. The trial court denied defendant's motion to reconsider sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's failure to rule on the merits of a motion for new trial prior to sentencing constituted an error patent, however, because defendant's original sentence was vacated as a result of his multiple offender adjudication, the error was cured. Defendant argued that the prosecutor's actions during closing argument were prejudicial and influenced the jury's verdict. The prosecutor crumbled the affidavit of a witness during his closing argument. The appellate court held that the prosecutor's actions were not prejudicial. By crumbling the paper, he gave emphasis to his argument that the document was worthless. The prosecutor questioned the affiant's credibility and the fact that he did not appear to testify at trial. The jury was adequately instructed on actual and constructive possession. The requested instruction was not supported by any fact brought out at trial. To the contrary, the testimony of the police officer demonstrated that defendant was initially in actual possession of the drugs. He was not &quot;merely present.&quot; Defendant did not produce any evidence to prove that he should have been sentenced to a sentence less than the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court denied defendant's motion for new trial and sentenced him that same day.  La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 873 required a 24-hour delay between the denial of a motion for new trial and sentencing, unless defendant waived such delay. There was no indication defendant waived the delay, however, defendant showed no prejudice. Thus, the error was harmless. Defendant argued, inter alia, that the record failed to show that he made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to a jury trial. The appellate court held that the record contained the transcript of defendant's waiver of his right to a jury trial. The transcript indicated that the judge addressed and questioned defendant in the presence of his attorney as to whether he understood he had a right to trial by judge or jury. Defendant responded affirmatively. The judge then asked what type of trial he elected to proceed by. Defendant replied: &quot;I would like to go with a judge.&quot; The record established defendant waived his right to a jury trial. Despite defendant's contention, the source of testimony was irrelevant to the establishment of the corpus delicti, so long as the statements were not those of the accused.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate filed what he styled as a habeas corpus action against defendant prison officials in the Second Judicial District Court for the Parish of Claiborne (Louisiana). The inmate demanded to be transferred back to the prison where he was formerly housed and enrolled in its mental health program. The trial court summarily dismissed the action with prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate alleged that he had been transferred from his former confinement to a new and harsher confinement as retaliation for exercising his rights to file complaints and lawsuits against prison officials. He did not allege that the complaints filed with the Department of Correction (DOC) had been resolved through its administrative remedy procedures. Thus, the trial and appellate courts found that his petition did not state a cognizable claim for habeas corpus relief as the inmate did not seek immediate or a speedier release from confinement. Rather, he alleged unconstitutional treatment while in confinement. He was challenging the conditions of his prison life, not the fact or length of his custody. The appellate court agreed with the trial court that the inmate's demand to be transferred back to the prison where he was formerly housed and enrolled in its mental health program must first be considered and disposed of through the administrative procedures of the DOC as required by the Corrections Administrative Remedy Procedure Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:1171-1180, and the Prison Litigation Reform Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:1181-1190.</SPAN></P>

The prisoner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court had found that under Louisiana's Correction Administrative Remedy Procedure (CARP), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:1171-1179, and Louisiana's Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:1181-1190, the prisoner was obligated to proceed with the administrative remedies available to him before he could file suit in the district court. The appellate court found that, after another case found that certain provisions of CARP were unconstitutional, the possibility existed for several sections of CARP to be saved from unconstitutionality vis-a-vis tort claims by the Department of Public Safety and Corrections adopting a new administrative remedy procedure and the legislature amending portions of CARP relating to judicial review. The new administrative remedy procedure rules simply informed the prisoner that he or she could file suit in district court. The legislature also amended provisions of CARP and PLRA. The trial court correctly found that the evidence presented indicated a failure by the prisoner to exhaust administrative remedies. The prisoner had 90 days to initiate administrative remedies for his action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried and convicted by a jury of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">En route to the scene of a fight, an officer pulled up behind defendant in a parking lot and called him over to the patrol vehicle. Defendant stopped briefly in front of the vehicle and then he ran down the street. While in pursuit, the officer stated that he saw defendant throw a gun down on the ground. After securing defendant, the officer retrieved the gun. Defendant also testified during trial. He stated that he ran from the officer because he was scared and denied possessing a firearm. However, defendant did admit that he had a prior simple burglary conviction. When viewed in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The appellate court found that the officer's eyewitness account alone was sufficient to convict defendant. Considering defendant's prior criminal history, the fact that he was on probation when he committed the instant offense, and the fact that he lacked remorse and fled from the police, his sentence of 12 years at hard labor without benefits did not shock the conscience and was not unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an appeal arising out of a taxpayer suit alleging that defendant city illegally contracted away its right to levy a per-person boarding tax on riverboat gaming operations within its jurisdiction, the Twenty-Sixth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Bossier (Louisiana) granted an exception of no right of action filed by all defendants except defendant parish police jury. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were an uncertified class of taxpayers and former members of the parish school board who challenged the legality of the contract between the city and the riverboat casinos. In the contracts, the city made a deal with the riverboats not to assess a boarding tax/fee in exchange for a fixed fee arrangement for a term of 10 years. In granting the exception of no right of action, the trial court found that plaintiffs had failed to show that the conduct complained of resulted in an increased tax burden and that they had no standing to challenge the legality of the contract at issue. The appellate court found that plaintiffs had at least a small and indeterminable interest in seeing that their elected representatives obeyed the laws and did not enter into illegal contracts in matters pertaining to the public fisc. The argument that the contract at issue represented a benefit and not a burden to the public fisc was without merit. The illegal surrender of the statutory right to tax the riverboats could not be considered a benefit to the public fisc. Thus, the trial court erred when it granted the exception of no right of action.</SPAN></P>

Taken in totality with all other evidence, the court held that the comments did not likely contribute to the verdict. The trial court offered to admonish the jury, but defendant declined the trial court's offer. Moreover, the statement did not warrant reversal of defendant's conviction, as the testimony overwhelmingly established defendant's guilt. Thus, any error was harmless.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court had originally held that the administrative remedies that were the subject of the exception of prematurity because of failure to exhaust those remedies were an invalid attempt to alter the original jurisdiction of the trial court by legislative acts as they related to tort suits. The appellate court granted the correction facility's application for rehearing to further clarify its judgment. The appellate court noted the legislature was free to enact procedures for initial submission of tort claims by prisoners to administrative agency for review as long as the action of the administrative agency did not constitute the exercise of original jurisdiction. The appellate court concluded it did express an opinion on the exception of prematurity for failure to exhaust administrative remedies because those procedures were deemed unconstitutional as applied to tort suits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the trial court erred in refusing to recuse the district attorney's office and in denying his motion to quash the habitual offender bill of information. He also complained that his sentence was excessive and unconstitutional. The appellate court found that defendant produced no evidence showing that the district attorney's bid for re-election created a personal interest in conflict with the fair and impartial administration of justice. Nor did defendant produce evidence to suggest that the State filed the habitual offender bill of information for the purpose of deterring or punishing the exercise of his legal rights; defendant failed to prove that a plea agreement existed or that he relinquished a fundamental right. Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying his motion to quash the habitual bill of information. As defendant was convicted of first degree robbery, purse snatching, and distribution of cocaine, his life sentence was proper under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1(c)(ii). The record did not show that defendant's case was exceptional under the Johnson test.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When appellee parents' medical malpractice suit was settled with defendant insurer, the Fourteenth Judicial District Court, Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, found that liability was admitted, thereby precluding appellant patient's compensation fund from contesting the issue. The parents' motion for summary judgment was granted, awarding them damages and future medical care of their minor son. The compensation fund appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents suit against defendants, a doctor, his insurer, and the hospital, alleged malpractice in the mother's prenatal care and in the delivery and birth of their son. On review, the compensation fund contended the trial court erred in implicitly ruling that the statutory admission of liability included an admission that the doctor was 100 percent responsible for the parents' damages. It further argued that because the parents' were still pursuing their claims against the hospital, the hospital could be found comparatively at fault for the son's injuries, and that the compensation fund would thereby be entitled to a pro rata reduction in the damages it could be required to pay. After reviewing the jurisprudence in this regard, the appellate court found that the compensation fund was correct in asserting that it was entitled to assert the comparative fault of the hospital. Accordingly, the parents were not entitled to summary judgment against the compensation fund based on the sole liability of the doctor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The summary judgment and the damages award were reversed and the case was remanded to determine the degree of comparative fault attributable to defendants, as well as for a determination of damages.</SPAN></P>

The Civil District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, sustained the defendants' dilatory exception of prematurity. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A nodule was found in the patient's lung. The patient underwent five courses of chemotherapy after the defendants' advised him that his bone scan indicated he had Stage IV cancer. When a second bone scan was conducted, it was learned that the patient's first bone scan had always been normal and the bone scan had been switched with another patient's bone scan. The patient claimed he did not need to submit his claim to a medical review panel as the misfiling of his bone scan was a clerical act and did not constitute malpractice as defined under the Private Medical Malpractice Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.41 et seq. The appellate court held that the misfiling of the bone scan was &quot;treatment related&quot; as the interpretation of the bone scan was a necessary step in the patient's cancer treatment program. The court also found the defendants were qualified health care providers within the meaning of &sect; 40:1299.41 and were entitled to a medical review panel hearing before the patient filed suit. Finally, the patient failed to prove that &sect; 40:1299.41 treated him differently from similarly situated patients under the State Medical Malpractice Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.39.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced as a second offender to 10 years at hard labor with the first two years to be served without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. The State argued that the trial court erred by failing to impose the statutory minimum sentence under La. Rev. Stat.

The appellate court found that defense counsel did not argue for a lighter sentence. Defendant did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that he was exception, that he was the victim of the legislature's failure to assign sentences that were meaningfully tailored to the culpability of defendant, the gravity of the offense, and the circumstances of the case. He did not rebut the presumption of constitutionality of the sentence under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1. Defendant had been arrested for battery, resisting an officer, and illegal uses of firearms during a crime. This was an indication of violent criminal activity; thus the trial court erred by sentencing defendant below the statutorily mandated guidelines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner sought judicial review of a decision in an administrative remedy procedure. After a hearing, a commissioner for the 19th Judicial District Court, Louisiana, recommended dismissal of the petition. The district court agreed with the recommendation and signed a judgment dismissing the petition with prejudice. The petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The essence of petitioner's appeal was that the prohibition against good time in his sentence was illegal because the sentencing court failed to stipulate for the record that he was being sentenced under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 890.1, and that his equal protection rights were violated because a co-defendant received the same sentence but allegedly received good time and was released. This allegation of an illegal sentence was not, however, a proper subject for habeas relief, and was not subject to the appellate court's jurisdiction, pursuant to the Corrections Administrative Remedy Procedure, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:1171-79. The petitioner's claim as to the denial of good time release should have been raised either through timely motion for reconsideration of sentence directed to the sentencing court, timely direct appeal of that sentence to the appropriate court of appeal, or at any time by a motion to correct illegal sentence directed to the sentencing court. As to the purported constitutional claim, the appellate court instructed the district court to dismiss that claim without prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal was dismissed, in part, for lack of jurisdiction, and the matter was remanded with instructions to dismiss the constitutional claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parish argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in finding that the employee was entitled to temporary total disability benefits as opposed to supplemental earnings benefits.

The appellate court held that the workers' compensation judge found that the employee continued to be temporarily, totally disabled, and that the compensation judge based that finding upon the employee's doctor's testimony. The doctor testified that the employee was unable to work due to his many problems which included the palsy, headaches, back pain, neck pain, family history, social abilities, and education. And that the employee's back pain and psychological problems associated with his initial work-related accident would alone have been disabling. The parish also claimed that the trial court erred in finding that the ankle injury was related to the work accident. The appellate court held that the emergency room records supported the judge's finding that the ankle injury was related to the original back and leg injury.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed her conviction for possession of cocaine and alleged, inter alia, that the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Division &quot;P&quot; (Louisiana), erred in denying her motion to suppress evidence and to suppress her statements, as the Miranda warnings she was given were incomplete and could not have served as a basis for admission of the alleged statements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended the detective failed to advise her that she could terminate questioning at any time. Defendant argued that she was not advised of her right to terminate questioning after she began making a statement. The right to terminate questioning was a right that had to be observed; but, it was not specifically included in the rights that had to be verbally advised. The detective testified that he told defendant about the narcotics investigation and advised her of her rights immediately after he removed her from the vehicle. Defendant stated that she understood those rights. The appellate court held that the detective advised defendant of all of her rights pursuant to Miranda. In addition, once defendant arrived at the police station, she refused to make any more statements. Thus, she exercised her right to terminate questioning, which the officer observed. The statements made by defendant to the detective occurred after she had been fully advised of her constitutional rights, and the trial judge did not err in denying the motion. The informant's tip was sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion to conduct a stop, and there was sufficient probable cause for an arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress and defendant's conviction of possession of cocaine were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to the charge of possession of marijuana over 60 pounds after the Thirty-third Judicial District Court, Parish of Allen, Louisiana, denied his motion to suppress. Defendant was sentenced to 15 years at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence. The trial court also denied defendant's motion for reconsideration of his sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after a confidential informant purchased drugs from him. The police executed a search warrant at defendant's home shortly after defendant had sold drugs to the informant, and the police recovered 120 pounds of marijuana from defendant's home. Defendant argued that the trial court should have granted his motion to suppress, as the trial court considered evidence at the evidentiary hearing that was outside the four corners of the affidavit, and that the affidavit was insufficient to establish probable cause. The appellate court held that while the language of the affidavit was imprecise, it was not so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to alert the issuing judge that its existence was entirely unreasonable. As there was no evidence that the police misled the issuing judge, or that the issuing judge was not a detached and neutral magistrate, exclusion of the evidence seized was not warranted. The legislature reduced the sentencing range for the crime that defendant pled guilty to after his conviction, but he was not entitled to be sentenced under the new sentencing range unless the legislature specifically stated the new statute was to be retroactive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of the motion to suppress was affirmed, but defendant's sentence was amended to provide that he serve 15 years imprisonment at hard labor, with 10 years to be served without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former inmates filed a petition for damages from a denial of due process and loss of liberty interest by reason of an illegal forfeiture of good time and concomitant increase in the number of days incarcerated. The 19th Judicial District Court, East Baton Rouge Parish (Louisiana), dismissed the suit without prejudice for the former inmates failure to show that all administrative remedies were exhausted. The former inmates appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the former inmates argued that the district court erred in maintaining the agency's exceptions of vagueness and improper cumulation based on the erroneous finding that the former inmates were required to submit to an unconstitutional administrative review process prior to filing suit for damages. The appellate court held that, in light of a recent Louisiana Supreme Court decision holding the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1171-1179&nbsp;unconstitutional as applied to inmate tort actions, the district court erred in dismissing the former inmates' claims. To the extent that &sect; 15:1171-1179 allowed the agency to exercise original jurisdiction in tort actions, the statute violated La. Const. art. V, &sect; 16(A), as it divested the district courts of original jurisdiction over a tort action. The claims asserted by the former inmates were claims to recover damages for injury while incarcerated in prison. Thus, to the extent they asserted a tort action, the former inmates were entitled to have the district court adjudicate their tort claims under its original jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sued defendants in a medical malpractice action.  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.39 limited the liability of state health-care providers in a medical malpractice action for general damages and lost wages to a $ 500,000 statutory cap. The appellate court found that the prior judgment adjudicating liability and awarding quantum was not res judicata as to the issue of constitutionality. Prior caselaw dictated that the resolution of the issue of the constitutionality of $ 500,000 statutory caps on medical malpractice judgments were constitutional. Nothing in the law permitted a court to depart from traditional notions of constitutional law to conclude that the statute violated the constitution. No Louisiana court had held that after analyzing due process, adequate remedy, original jurisdiction, sovereign immunity, and separation of powers issues presented in similar cases involving claims against both private and public health-care providers. If the cap was to be changed, it had to be by the power of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant for three counts of armed robbery. Defendant filed motions for post verdict judgment of acquittal and new trial, which were denied. The Twenty-First Judicial District Court, Parish of Tangipahoa, Louisiana, sentenced defendant to 99 years at hard labor, without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence, on each count, to run consecutive with each other. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This matter involved three armed robberies committed in the same town. On appeal, defendant argued there was insufficient evidence to prove his identity as the perpetrator. He contended the eyewitnesses' identifications were unreliable because each eyewitness failed to see or mention tattoos on his face and arms. The State argued the uncontradicted identification by the witness in each robbery was sufficient to negate any reasonable probability of misidentification. The appeals court concluded that a rational trier of fact, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, could have concluded that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was the perpetrator in each of the three robberies. During the trial, the victims of the three armed robberies each identified defendant as the man who robbed him or her at gunpoint. Each of these three victims also viewed an out-of-court photographic lineup and identified defendant as the armed robber. In addition to the victims' identifications, the State introduced evidence of similarities in the three crimes. The trial court's decision to allow the jury to take notes was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of second degree murder. The Third Judicial District Court for the Parish of Lincoln, Louisiana, imposed the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was found in her trailer. She had been killed by a slash wound to the neck. Forensic examination revealed defendant's bloody fingerprints on items inside the trailer. Defendant denied knowing the victim. He later stated he and the victim had sexual relations in the trailer two weeks before the murder and that it was the last time he was in the residence. Subsequently, he admitted he was in the victim's trailer the night of the murder. At trial, defendant's wife testified against him. On appeal, defendant argued the evidence was circumstantial regarding his identity as the murderer and did not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence. The appeals court disagreed. Defendant's statement to the police offered no explanation as to why his blood would have commingled with that of the victim if he merely discovered the body. Defendant's identity as the perpetrator of the offense was clearly proven. Further, defendant's right to spousal privilege pertaining to confidential communications was upheld. However, when defendant's wife chose to waive her spousal privilege to not testify against her husband, she was allowed to testify as to non-privileged matters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted five claims in his relief application. First, defendant argued there was no probable cause for the indictment on aggravated rape and second degree kidnapping. The court ruled that the claim obviously could have been raised prior to trial, during the appeal or defendant's first relief application, and as it was not, should have been barred under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 930.4. Also, lack of probable cause for an indictment or following a preliminary hearing was moot after conviction. Second, defendant asserted the selection of the grand jury foreperson violated the constitution because of the exclusion of African-Americans. The court ruled that such a challenge must have been raised pretrial in a motion to quash or it was waived. Thirdly, defendant's request to recuse a judge was moot. Defendant's fourth claim was that the evidence was insufficient to convict him on the charge of second degree kidnapping, a claim that was barred under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 930.4. Defendant's fifth claim was based on ineffective assistance of counsel, which the court determined was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court ordered defendant's appeals be consolidated. On review, the appellate court found defendant only briefed the conviction for felony battery of a police officer. Therefore, defendant's issues regarding the misdemeanor convictions were considered abandoned. Defendant argued that when she entered her guilty plea, the State failed to articulate sufficient facts to establish a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 14:34.cB(3), and thus, did not meet its burden. In its brief, the State pointed out that, at the time of her guilty plea, defendant stated the police officer threw her on the ground and that she got up and kicked him twice. The prosecutor stated that the factual basis for the plea was that defendant kicked the officer several times in the groin which caused and required medical attention. The appellate court ruled that this was a sufficient factual basis to establish strong evidence of actual guilt. Thus, defendant's guilty plea to the charge of battery on a police officer requiring medical attention was valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(A) and sentenced to 30 years at hard labor. Defendant argued that the district court erred in failing to grant his request to include jury instructions on alibi witnesses. Defendant argued that the use of an alibi was more than a defense, but rather it was evidence used to rebut the State's case. The appellate court found defendant's counsel was accurately instructed on the special jury instructions regarding the use of alibi witnesses. Counsel could argue that the alibi witnesses disproved the State's allegation that defendant committed the crime. Defendant was present and facilitated the sale of crack cocaine by the passenger to the informant, and there was nothing in the vehicle that prevented the informant from observing or hearing the drug transaction as it transpired. The four rocks that the informant purchased from defendant were tested and found to be positive for the presence of cocaine. Defendant's sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive as the district court articulated specific reasons for the 30-year sentence, and why the statutory minimum sentence was not constitutionally justifiable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress and that the evidence was insufficient to convict him. The evidence showed that the officers stopped defendant and his friends because they were in violation of a curfew. A computer check revealed that defendant had outstanding arrest warrants. Defendant ran away and an officer saw that defendant had a gun. Defendant was arrested and searched. The appellate court found that once the officers found that there was an outstanding warrant, they had probable cause to arrest. The trial court therefore correctly denied the motion to suppress. The appellate court also found the State presented no evidence that defendant was convicted of a prior felony. The officers in fact did not know of what crime defendant had been convicted. The only testimony was hearsay evidence of an unknown police operator that defendant had a record. No proof existed in the record that defendant was the same named person who was convicted of armed robbery in a different parish. Accordingly, defendant's conviction was amended to reflect a conviction for the lesser-included offense of illegal carrying of weapons.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessor and lessee entered into a lease for commercial retail space. The lease required the lessor to perform certain improvements to the space and required the lessee to provide other improvements.

The appellate court further ruled the lessor failed to satisfy her burden of proof that the ordinance was enforced at all against the property. The record did not support the lessor's assertion that the ordinance affected a taking of the property by prohibiting the collection of rent from the space. The lessor did not present any evidence that Jefferson Parish enforced the ordinance or that enforcement as to the property prevented any actual merchandise deliveries at any time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insureds, who were both retired, made a claim for damages under the underinsured/uninsured (UM) provisions of their automobile policy after a car crashed into their home. The insurer prevailed on a summary judgment motion on the grounds that the insureds selected &quot;economic-only&quot; UM coverage. The insureds' claimed that, because they did not understand the meaning of &quot;non-economic&quot; loss only, they did not have a &quot;meaningful selection.&quot; If the insureds did not have a meaningful selection in choosing the UM coverage, the policy form violated case law. The appellate court noted that the insurer's form met all the necessary requirements, as it explained the difference between economic and non-economic coverage. The court also held that the agent was not negligent, as he had no duty to explain to the insureds that the coverage they selected was of little benefit to them. Moreover, the evidence provided indicated that the agent answered all the insureds' questions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured while driving in the course and scope of his employment. When the injured employee failed to make payment to the employer's insurer, pursuant to a settlement agreement, it sought reimbursement from the injured employee, his attorney, and the other driver's insurer, by filing motions to enforce a prior judgment. The attorney's motion to withdraw as counsel based on a conflict of interest was granted, and the injured employee was ordered to deposit money into the court's registry. After withdrawing as counsel, the attorney filed a motion for Moody fees. The court ruled as follows: (1) there was not fair notice that the employer's insurer was attempting to pursue a separate action for damages; (2) if the employer's insurer wished to pursue an action for damages, it had to file suit with the required factual allegations to support its causes of action and effect proper service against the true targets of its action; and (3) the attorney did not provide a sufficient basis for an award of fees.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2800.12. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the trial court erred in overruling the State's declinatory exception, raising the objection of lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The appellate court found that it was without jurisdiction to issue or review advisory opinions and could only review matters that were justiciable. The clinics sought to enjoin the State from enforcing La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2800.12. The statute, however, created a private right of action in favor of women who suffered damage while undergoing an abortion. The statute contained no provision authorizing the State or any of its agencies or officers to enforce, or take any action on, the provisions of the statute. The statute created no apparent dispute between the clinics and the State. The clinics would have the opportunity to present their defenses and seek adequate remedy, if and when private actions were brought against them. It was the private plaintiff, bringing a private lawsuit under the statute, who caused the injury of which the clinics complained. No justiciable controversy existed between the clinics and the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff town sued defendant town attorney over some property. Third party lawyer, through reconventional demands and other means, became part of the suit, which came to focus on attorney fees. The lawyer settled with the town. On remand, the 13th Judicial District Court, Parish of Evangeline (Louisiana), found the parties' contingent fee contract invalid and awarded attorney fees on the basis of quantum meruit. The town attorney appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town was governed by a mayor and board of aldermen. The lawyer worked for a hospital or nursing home, management over which was transferred from non-profits to a company. The mayor approached the town attorney and lawyer regarding representing the town in accounting and collection efforts as to money due the town from the non-profits. They entered into a contingent fee contract for 25 and 33.3 percent of all collections before and after litigation respectively. The sums involved turned out to be large. External criticism led the mayor to choose not to honor the agreement. The attorney asserted that he should have been paid for the collection of some funds already in the town's possession, as he had to defend against the non-profits' claim for reimbursement. The appellate court found that the attorney was not entitled to a contingent fee over funds he merely transferred from one town account to another. The contingent fee was to be based on amounts recovered, not on accounts receivable assigned to the town in settlement. The contingent fees were reasonable under La. St. Bar. Art. X, R. 1.5(a) for the difficult job. The mayor and board understood the contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The determination that the contingent fee contract was invalid was reversed. Judgment was rendered increasing the attorney fee award from $ 60,875 to $ 159,265, giving the town credit for $ 125,000 previously retained by the town attorney, and awarding him legal interest on that portion of the award not already in his possession from the date of judicial demand until paid in full.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife filed their lawsuit on January 24, 2000 alleging that the first time the wife was told she had hepatitis C was on February 5, 1999. At the time of the wife's transfusion LA. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628 did not apply to blood centers, but in 1990 it was amended to include community blood centers. In 1999 the legislature enacted La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628.1 (1999) which was a remedial, retroactive statute for pending claims. The appellate court found that: (1) the district court erred in granting the exception of prescription because LA. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628 was not applicable to claims against a blood center before September 7, 1990, and the husband and wife's claim against the blood center was timely under LA. Rev. Stat.

The appellate court ruled that, in imposing and maintaining the ten-year sentences, the trial court considered very thoroughly the circumstances of the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The stepfather was married to the child's mother since 1998, and the child resided with them since that time.

The biological father served over three years in prison and was transferred to a work release facility in December of 1999. The appellate court did not find any manifest error in the trial court's factual determinations that the biological father failed to comply with the order of support and failed to communicate with the child for a period greater than six months. The stepfather satisfied his burden of proving the requirements of La. Child. Code art. 1245(C), and the biological father's consent was not required in the adoption proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, convicted defendant of aggravated flight from an officer, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14:108.1, and he was resentenced as a third-felony offender to 16 months' imprisonment at hard labor, with credit for time served. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State contended that the sentence imposed on defendant as a third-felony offender was illegally lenient. The State argued that whether the trial judge erroneously imposed sentence under the multiple offender statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(2)(b)(ii), as amended, or made a downward departure from the mandatory sentence required for third felony offenders, who had a prior conviction for a crime of violence, the trial court erred. The appellate court found that the multiple offender statute was inapplicable. In the enactment of 2001 La. Acts 403, the legislature was cognizant that it was amending a number of criminal statutes, with the intent to prospectively lessen prison overcrowding. The legislature did not intend that the old and new versions of the statute should apply at the same time. Thus, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, as amended, applied to crimes committed after the effective date of the amendment. Defendant presented no evidence to rebut the presumption that the mandatory sentence of life, without benefits of parole, probation or suspension of sentence, was unconstitutional. A downward departure was unwarranted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence was vacated and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), denied defendant's motion to suppress a confession and entered a final judgment of conviction after a jury found defendant guilty of attempted possession of cocaine. Both defendant and the State challenged imposition of the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police were on patrol when they noticed defendant. He was walking in the same direction the officers were driving, and after he glanced over his shoulder and saw them, he seemed to become nervous. He stopped, put his right hand in his pants pocket, removed a bag, dropped it to the sidewalk, and began to walk fast. The bag contained a glass tube. Two conclusive testing procedures on the residue in the tube indicated the substance in the tube was crack cocaine. After defendant was convicted, he was sentenced. The trial court applied the version of a sentencing statute that was not amended until after defendant committed his offense. After a 30-year sentence was imposed, the appellate court found the trial court applied the wrong version of the statute. The appellate court agreed with the State that the trial court was obligated to apply the sentencing statute in effect at the time the offense was committed, especially since the amended statute stated that it applied only prospectively. Since the proper statute required that defendant be sentenced to life in prison because he had been adjudicated to be a fourth felony offender, the case had to be remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction was affirmed, but the sentence was vacated and the case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The Criminal District Court for the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) re-sentenced defendant to serve 50 years at hard labor under the Habitual Offender Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1. The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered an elderly woman's home to rob her. Defendant asked for the woman's money and wedding ring. The victim begged defendant not to take her ring, but he forced it off her finger. Defendant was initially sentenced to 25 years and then re-sentenced as a habitual offender to 50 years at hard labor. A different judicial district court granted defendant's motion and ordered that the record be amended to show that he was serving a 25 year term. The court who presided over defendant's trial and original sentencing then granted the State's motion to correct an illegal sentence and re-instated the sentence for 50 years at hard labor. The appellate court dismissed defendant's claim that he was deprived the right to counsel of his choice as defendant failed to show how he was prejudiced by his appointed counsel's representation or that the appointed counsel was incompetent. It was proper for the trial court to re-instate the 50 year sentence as the judicial district that had vacated it had no authority to do so. Defendant's sentence was within the range suggested for his crime as the acts of violence toward the elderly victim justified a sentence at the higher range.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The re-instatement of the sentence of 50 years at hard labor was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The majority owners were not parties to the lawsuit. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the partnership. The minority owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minority landowners contended that the sale was invalid for three reasons: (1) the consideration for the sale was so inadequate as to constitute lesion beyond moiety; (2) the partnership did not strictly comply with the provisions of La.

The trial court chose to reject the minority landowners' expert testimony regarding the value of the timber and to accept the testimony of the other foresters. The appellate court found no manifest error in the trial court's decision that the price paid by the partnership was not less than 50 percent of the fair market value and thus was not lesionary. The appellate court rejected the minority landowners' second argument finding that the partnership offered the same terms and conditions to them as to the majority owners and thus the partnership complied fully with the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3:4278.2. The appellate court held the statute was unconstitutional in that it denied the minority landowners procedural due process protections because the majority owners could always foreclose any meaningful challenge to their decision to sell timber.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the preemptive period of LA. Rev. Stat.

The appellate court held that both the civil service system and the New Orleans Home Rule government system were creatures of the Louisiana Constitution. The commission's rules on privatization contracts related immediately to the selection, hiring, promotion, and demotion of public employees. The employees covered by the rules were classified civil service employees, working for the city's department of property management. The rules protected those classified employees from an administration that would use privatization as a means of eliminating civil service protection of the employees and defeating the objectives of providing for selection, hiring, promotion, and demotion on the basis of merit. The privatization rules were squarely within the constitutional authority granted to the commission and to the authority granted to the commission by the New Orleans Home Rule Charter, and the commission's rules had the effect of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of manslaughter by a Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), jury and sentenced to 40 years at hard labor. The State filed a multiple offender bill of information alleging defendant to be a third felony offender. The trial court vacated defendant's original sentence and imposed an enhanced sentence of life imprisonment without parole. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended the evidence was insufficient to convict him of manslaughter, as he did not have the requisite intent to kill the victim. He argued the shooter twisted his hand and then ripped the gun from it. Defendant was present when the shooter and the victim began arguing. Defendant then left the room and retrieved a gun from the shooter's car. The jury concluded that defendant willingly and knowingly provided the shooter with the weapon that he used to kill the victim, a conclusion the appellate court found was supported by the record. Defendant did nothing to assist the victim after the shooting. He did not call the police and left immediately after the crime with the shooter. Defendant argued his life sentence as a third felony offender was constitutionally excessive. Because his underlying felony was a crime of violence, the multiple offender statute mandated a life sentence. Defendant made no showing of exceptional circumstances to justify a downward departure from the required minimum sentence. He presented no evidence or argument at the time of sentencing regarding a downward departure. The appellate court concluded defendant's life sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 25th Judicial Court, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, granted judgment in favor of appellee parish government in its petition for declaratory judgment asking the trial court to declare it to be owner of certain property over appellant state. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state argued that the trial court erred in its denial of the state's peremptory exception raising the objection of no right of action and in its ruling that the government obtained ownership of certain minerals affecting the property when the board of commissioners merged into the parish government. The appellate court found that the state conveyed the tract to the board in 1938, which granted a mineral lease, including the disputed tract. The board was later consolidated into the parish government. Thus, the government had obtained ownership of certain mineral rights affecting the tract when the board merged. There was a genuine factual issue as to causation of the land loss, because there was no evidence as to exactly how the tract came to be covered by the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico.  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:1152 applied because a mineral lease was granted on the land that became water bottoms, which were retained by the government. The state could not challenge the constitutionality of the statute. The trial court did not have to describe the boundaries of the tract as it was not one that affected title to immovable property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of armed robbery. The First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo (Louisiana) denied defendant's motions for a new trial and for post-verdict judgment of acquittal and sentenced him to serve 58 years at hard labor without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, and it denied his motion to reconsider sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At gunpoint, two assailants demanded the victim's car keys, billfold, and money. While the assailants were having difficulty unlocking the victim's vehicle, he escaped and witnessed his vehicle being driven away from the scene. The court ruled that, based upon the record, the jury could have reasonably found that the State negated any reasonable probability of misidentification. Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, rational jurors could have found the essential elements of armed robbery proven beyond a reasonable doubt. There was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that defendant was the individual who took the victim's property by the use of force or intimidation while armed with a handgun. There was no err in denying defendant's motion in limine to exclude the in-court identification. A review of the testimony showed defendant did not satisfy his burden of proving that the in-court identification was suggestive and that there was a substantial likelihood of misidentification. Furthermore, the sentence imposed was neither grossly disproportionate to the severity of the offense nor shocking to the sense of justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the 28th Judicial District Court, Parish of La Salle, Louisiana, of operating a vehicle while intoxicated, third offense, and sentenced to a 5-year prison sentence at hard labor with 30 months suspended, in-patient treatment for alcohol abuse, and supervised probation. Defendant appealed that his sentence was excessive in light of a change to the statutory sentencing provisions effective after the date of his offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued on appeal that a change made subsequent to his offense in the sentencing provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:98, to require that only 30 days of a prison sentence be imposed without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence, instead of the 6 months previously required, required the trial court to reconsider his sentence. The appellate court held that because the trial court sentenced the defendant pursuant to the statute in effect at the time of his offense, it did not commit a manifest abuse of discretion by denying his motion for reconsideration. In considering the constitutional excessiveness of defendant's sentence, the appellate court noted, as had the trial court, that the defendant's record contained nine alcohol-related arrests and that because of his alcohol abuse, the defendant did not contemplate the serious threat that his behavior was to others. Defendant's sentence was within the sentencing guidelines of &sect; 14:98 at the time of the offense. Although defendant contended in mitigation of his sentence that he was not involved in an accident at the time of the stop, the sentence was neither excessive, nor unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Nineteenth Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, nullified and vacated its previous judgment in favor of appellants, insurer and employer, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in favor of appellee employee. The insurer and employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants contended that the trial court erred in holding that the Nineteenth Judicial District Court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear the insurer's petition to terminate and/or modify workers' compensation benefits. Appellants asserted that the ground for nullity appeared in the record, that the date of injury was in 1976, and therefore La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 2005 applied and precluded the employee from seeking annulment of the 1997 judgment. The appellate court found, however, that appellants failed to recognize that the codal provision suggested that the restrictions listed were disjunctive. Therefore, even though the ground for nullity appeared in the record of appeal, so long as the appellate court did not consider the ground, an action of nullity could be sought. A petition filed after January 1, 1990, seeking modification of a prior district court judgment had to be heard by the Louisiana Office of Workers' Compensation Administration (OWC). The insurer filed a petition after the date seeking termination of the employee's benefits; therefore the OWC had exclusive jurisdiction to hear the petition for modification.</SPAN></P>
