<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-A constitutional challenge by a political action committee to the 2015-16 Appropriations Act had merit, as the inclusion of 2015 S.C. Acts 91, Part 1B, &sect; 84, Proviso 84.18, violated the &quot;one subject&quot; requirement and the log-rolling prohibition of S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 17 because it related to the suspension of the appointment power and it was not reasonably and inherently related to the raising and spending of tax monies; [2]-As the provision of the General Appropriations Act was not germane to the purpose of that Act, and striking the Act in its entirety was a drastic remedy, the court modified its holding in Am. Petroleum Inst. v. South Carolina Dep't of Rev., 382 S.C. 572 (2009), such that it excised just the offending provision.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 63-3-590 (2010) and S.C. R. Fam. Ct. 9(a), which mandated bench trials in juvenile proceedings, were constitutional because the U.S. Constitution did not provide a right to a jury trial in a juvenile proceeding; [2]-As the juvenile adjudication process in family court was not of a like nature or similar to the manner in which juveniles were criminally charged at the time the South Carolina Constitution was enacted, S.C.

Code Ann. &sect; 23-3-540(C) and (H) (Supp. 2011) by the Pickens County Circuit Court, South Carolina, as part of her penalty for violating her probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court held that the CSO did not have a fundamental right to be let alone under the Due Process Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. The CSO's mandatory enrollment in the SMP invoked minimal due process protection as it placed significant restraints on offenders that amounted to a liberty interest and the CSO had served her sentence. The stated purpose for &sect; 23-3-540 of protecting the public from sex offenders and aiding law enforcement satisfied the rational relationship test for the initial mandatory imposition of satellite monitoring for certain child-sex crimes and &sect; 23-3-540(C) was constitutional. The final sentence of &sect; 23-3540(H) was unconstitutional as the absence of an opportunity for judicial review to assess a risk of re-offending for persons convicted of engaging in or attempting criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the first degree and lewd act was arbitrary and was not rationally related to the statute's purpose. The remainder of the statute did not have to be invalidated. The CSO had to comply with the monitoring requirement, but she could avail herself of the &sect; 23-3-540(H) judicial review process outlined for the &sect; 23-3-540(G) offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The South Carolina Budget and Control Board decided to split the premium increase for a statewide, group health insurance plan equally between the State of South Carolina and enrollees. The officers of state education and employee associations argued that the Board did not have the power, except in limited circumstances, which were not applicable, to raise premiums for enrollees. They contended that the Board thus violated the separation of powers required by the South Carolina Constitution because it substituted its policy choices for those enacted by the South Carolina General Assembly. The Board contend that it had complete discretion to take the challenged action because the General Assembly simply appropriated funds without any indication for what the funds were appropriated. The court found that the Board violated the separation of powers provision, S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, by substituting its own policy for that of the General Assembly. Additionally, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 1-11-710 (1992) (amended 2012) mandated the expenditure of the funds appropriated for premium increases. Thus, the Board did not have the power to decline to spend all of the appropriated funds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer filed suit under S.C. App. Ct. R. 245 seeking to strike down the exemptions and caps to the state sales tax in toto because they were so numerous they no longer bore a rational relationship to their original purpose, arguing that S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 12-36-2110 and 12-36-2120 (Supp. 2011) violated the Equal Protection Clause, S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, and constituted special legislation under S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 34, cl. IX.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court held that the taxpayer lacked statutory and constitutional standing. Even if he had standing under the public importance exception, his claims failed. Sections 12-36-2110 and 12-36-2120 created 85 classification for equal protection purposes. The state's highest court could not determine whether each classification was supported by a rational basis as the taxpayer argued solely that the sheer number of exemptions and caps rendered the statutes arbitrary and unconstitutional. While the exemptions might be arbitrary in the political or economic sense, that did not mean they were arbitrary in the constitutional sense. The taxpayer's claim that the number of exemptions showed that they were arbitrary had been rejected. The taxpayer did not show that the classifications were not supported by a rational basis. The claim that the statutes constituted special legislation rested solely on the number of caps and exemptions. The state's highest court was concerned not with size or volume, but with content. Because the taxpayer insisted that the content of the caps and exemptions not be examined, he failed to prove they were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The South Carolina Budget and Control Board split a premium increase for the state employee group health insurance plan between the State and enrollees. Petitioner enrollees filed a declaratory judgment suit seeking an injunction prohibiting the increase of their insurance premiums and compelling the Board to use the funds appropriated in the 2012-2013 South Carolina Appropriations Act (AA) for premium increases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court held that the AA appropriated $ 51,528,219 for health insurance employer contributions. Although the Board members acknowledged that the South Carolina legislature fully funded the premium increases, they split the premium increase equally between the State and the enrollees. The Board violated the separation of powers doctrine under S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 since it substituted its policy choices for the legislature's. In light of the AA and S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 1-11-710(A)(1) (Supp. 2012), the legislature mandated the appropriated funds be spent in full on the premium increases and afforded the Board no discretion. To allow the Board to decline appropriated funds based on its own policy choices would have been an impermissible delegation of the legislature's powers under the nondelegation doctrine. Statutes could not be construed to be unconstitutional when susceptible to a constitutional interpretation. The enrollees did not face irreparable harm as the premiums paid could be returned and the declaratory judgment provided the enrollees with an adequate remedy at law. An injunction was not required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A judgment was entered for the enrollees declaring that the Board's premium increase was unconstitutional as a violation of the separation of powers doctrine and directing the Board to apply the appropriated funds to the plan's premium increases and to return all premium increases collected from the enrollees. The request for injunctive relief was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 63-7-2570(8). The supreme court disagreed, finding that &sect; 63-7-2570(8) provided the requisite level of due process to preserve a parent's fundamental rights in a termination proceeding while at the same time recognizing the State's compelling interest in providing for the health and welfare of children who faced abuse, neglect, or abandonment. The court of appeals erred in finding that the DSS did not meet its burden of proving termination of the mother's parental rights was in the children's best interests. While at times she had taken steps to remedy the situation leading to removal of the children, she had failed to make the necessary lifestyle changes to provide them with a safe and stable environment. She refused to take responsibility for her drug activity, and failed to show that she could provide for the children without the help of the children's father. The father admitted that he could not maintain adequate housing and employment, and stipulated to prior sexual abuse of a minor, but the mother continued to cohabitate with him, even up until oral argument of the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, defendant was convicted of driving under suspension and of leaving the scene of an accident with death (S.C.

The Greenwood County Circuit Court (South Carolina) sentenced him to 20 years' imprisonment for leaving the scene, and a concurrent sentence of six months' imprisonment for driving under suspension. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After causing an accident that killed a motorcyclist, defendant kept on driving. The victim's traveling companion, another motorcyclist, followed defendant until he pulled over. The companion told defendant about the accident; defendant agreed to return to the scene, but instead drove off. He argued that the penalty portion of &sect; 56-5-1210 violated the Eighth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VIII, because the gravity of his offense was not proportionate to the severity of the punishment, and that the  trial court erred in ruling to the contrary. The high court disagreed. The trial court's statements at sentencing were the very embodiment of proportionality, and it performed the analysis envisioned by &sect; 56-5-1210 in sentencing defendant based on the facts and circumstances of the case. Despite defendant's reprehensible behavior, the trial court did not sentence him to the maximum punishment allowed under &sect; 56-5-1210. As the legislature could have rationally concluded that leaving the scene of an accident where death resulted posed a risk substantial enough to support the penalty portion of &sect; 56-5-1210, that provision was not grossly disproportionate to the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged as a juvenile. When defendant pleaded guilty he raised no objection to the family court waiver. Defendant argued that the South Carolina's juvenile transfer law violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial and due process of law under Apprendi. The supreme court held that because South Carolina permitted only unconditional guilty pleas, and no jurisdictional claim was presented, defendant waived his right to assert a claim based on Apprendi. An erroneous order transferring a juvenile to general sessions court would be a judicial error, not a jurisdictional error. Defendant's Apprendi challenge failed on the merits. Apprendi was not applicable to a family court juvenile waiver hearing, for the decision whether to waive a juvenile to general sessions court in no manner determined the juvenile's guilt, innocence, or punishment. It merely determined the forum in which the case was to be tried.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In creating an open space zoning district, the town imposed land-use restrictions on all golf course properties, permitting only recreation and conservation uses. The town denied the owner's request to have its golf course property rezoned to allow residential development. The town granted a rezoning petition submitted by developers who owned another golf course. The court found no equal protection violation under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 because there were significant differences between the two rezoning petitions and no discriminatory animus was shown. The other developers provided more detail about their proposal, which made fewer changes to golf course areas of play and had general community support. There was no substantive due process violation, as determined under an arbitrary and capricious standard, because the town's exercise of its police power in creating the zoning district was rationally related to its legitimate land-use goals and the rezoning applied to all golf courses. Neither a categorical nor a regulatory taking occurred; the entire area was the relevant parcel, its use as a golf course would continue, and it retained significant value after the rezoning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In terms of admission requirements, the school's brochure/application stated that students had to be residents of Charleston County and complete an application. The student resided with her parents in Berkeley County. The student was accepted by the school and confirmed her intention to provide a Charleston County residence address prior to enrollment. The court agreed with the Board that the General Assembly conferred discretionary authority on a board of trustees to set attendance criteria for particular schools and to determine which school in its district a student may attend. However, the Board's subsequent attempt to rescind that decision was unavailing because, in making its decision, the Board relied on the unlawful policy purporting to mandate Charleston County residency as a requirement for acceptance at the school. The &quot;resident only&quot; criterion ran afoul of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 59-63-30 because any child meeting the threshold established by that provision, either as a resident or a property owner of the subject school district, was entitled to attend that district's schools.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's case was not tried until nearly two years after his arrest. After his appeal was perfected, the state public defender association filed an amicus brief challenging the constitutionality of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 1-7-330 (2005), which vested control of the criminal docket in the circuit solicitor. Although this issue had not been raised by defendant, the high court elected to address it because of its public importance. As &sect; 1-7-330 was at odds with the court's inherent judicial power to control the order of its business, it violated the separation of powers principle embodied in S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 and was unconstitutional. However, defendant did not suffer any prejudice from the solicitor's controlling when his case would be called for trial. It rejected his claim that the solicitor, part of the executive branch, engaged in judge-shopping, as there was no evidence the trial court ruled in favor of the State on various issues out of animus towards defendant or allegiance to the State. The two-year delay in bringing the case to trial did not violate defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial because there was no evidence of any actual prejudice to his case.</SPAN></P>

The tenant took a &quot;rake&quot; out of the pot to cover the cost of refreshments he provided.

The intermediate appellate court held that defendants were entitled to directed verdicts because a residence could not qualify as a &quot;house used as a place of gaming&quot; under &sect; 16-19-40; alternatively, it held that &sect; 16-19-40(a) was unconstitutionally overbroad and void for vagueness. The instant court held that since the house was used &quot;as a place of gaming,&quot; and betting on a game of skill was a violation if done in a prohibited location, defendants violated &sect; 16-19-40 and had not been entitled to directed verdicts. Because &sect; 16-19-40(a) did not offend the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, it was not overbroad. Defendants lacked standing to assert that &sect; 16-19-40(a) was void for vagueness, as their conduct clearly fell within the statutory proscription.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner insurer filed a petition challenging the constitutionality of 2011 S.C. Acts 88 (Act No. 26), codified at S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 38-61-70 (Supp. 2011).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Act No. 26 regulated coverage provided by commercial general liability (CGL) insurance policies for construction-related work. The high court held the legislature did not violate the separation of powers doctrine, since by enacting Act No. 26, it did not retroactively overrule the court's interpretation of a statute. Under the rational basis test, Act No. 26 was not improper special legislation under S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 34, cl. IX, and did not violate the state and federal Equal Protection Clauses, as the legislature had a logical reason for enacting it. Though the legislature had the power to define the meaning of &quot;occurrence&quot; in CGL policies, it was a violation of the South Carolina and federal Contract Clauses to apply this new definition retroactively, as Act No. 26 substantially impaired preexisting contractual relationships by mandating that all CGL policies be legislatively amended to include a new statutory definition of &quot;occurrence&quot; and by applying this mandate retroactively. As the legislature did not need to enact Act No. 26 in order to address an emergency, its retroactivity provision was neither necessary nor reasonable, and, therefore, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court found the retroactivity portion of Act No. 26, codified at &sect; 38-61-70(E), unconstitutional, and severed that portion from the body of Act No. 26, which was otherwise constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The inmate sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate challenged the SCDC's policy barring him from providing legal assistance to another inmate. The ALC held it lacked jurisdiction under &sect; 1-23-600(D) to hear appeals in which inmates did not lose good time. As the loss of the opportunity to earn sentence-related credits did not implicate a State-created liberty interest, the high court overruled Furtick v. South Carolina Department of Corrections, 649 S.E.2d 35 (2007). The ALC erred in summarily dismissing the appeal, as it had jurisdiction to rule on the inmate's as-applied constitutional challenge to the policy. But as he did not allege there was no other source of aid for illiterate inmates, he did not show the policy violated Johnson v. Avery. He lacked standing to challenge the adequacy of the law library or library personnel. That he was not allowed to question his accuser or to present evidence to refute the charge did not violate his due process rights, as 1) no liberty interest was involved, 2) inmates had no constitutional right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, 3) he admitted the prohibited conduct, and 4) any defenses could have been raised and reviewed pursuant to the internal prison grievance process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The biological mother and father did not live together prior to the baby's birth. The father did not support the mother financially. The mother sent a text message to the father asking if he would rather pay child support or surrender his parental rights. The father responded via text message that he would relinquish his rights, but testified that he believed he was relinquishing his rights to the mother. The family court held that the father met the ICWA's definition of &quot;parent&quot; by both acknowledging his paternity through the pursuit of court proceedings as soon as he realized the child had been placed up for adoption and establishing his paternity through DNA testing. The appellate court agreed. The adoptive parents did not follow the clear procedural directives of 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1913(a) in obtaining the father's consent. Moreover, even if that &quot;consent&quot; was valid, the Father's subsequent legal campaign to obtain custody rendered any such consent withdrawn. Therefore, neither the father's signature on the &quot;Acceptance of Service&quot; document, nor his stated intentions to relinquish his rights, were effectual forms of voluntary consent under the ICWA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's daughter testified that defendant molested her when she was five or six. Defendant argued that the panel erred in denying his motion to suppress a recording of his phone conversation with the victim wherein he admitted the abuse, because the recording, intercepted without the prior consent of either party, violated the South Carolina Homeland Security Act (Wiretap Act), S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-30-10 et. seq. (Supp. 2010). The high court disagreed. The Wiretap Act allowed the victim's mother, as her guardian, to vicariously consent on the victim's behalf to record the phone conversation. The evidence supported the panel's finding that the mother had a good faith basis for recording the conversation, as she testified she believed this would help her decide if the victim needed counseling. Interception of the phone conversation was an not unreasonable invasion of privacy under S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. A forensic videotape of an interview with the victim was properly admitted under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-23-175 (Supp. 2010), as the forensic interviewer did not improperly lead the victim, she answered the questions on her own accord, and the tape included no bolstering testimony.</SPAN></P>

The Greenville County Circuit Court (South Carolina) revoked her probation for two years; ordered that her probation be terminated upon release; and ordered that she be subject to satellite monitoring for the rest of her life, pursuant to S.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although appellate presented expert testimony at the revocation hearing that she posed a low risk of reoffending, the trial court found that it was statutorily mandated to impose lifetime satellite monitoring without making any findings as to her likelihood of reoffending. Since she had been convicted of lewd act, there was no statutory mechanism for her to seek relief from this lifetime monitoring. Moreover, she could not leave the state without prior approval and could only be gone overnight in the case of an emergency. The high court held that requiring a convicted sex offender who was under no probationary or similar restrictions to submit to satellite monitoring for the rest of her life if she posed a low risk of reoffending violated her substantive due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Further, &sect; 23-540's travel policy infringed on the offender's fundamental right to travel without any consideration of whether such a restriction was warranted. If the trial court found that an offender had a low risk of re-offending but still imposed monitoring, the offender could petition for release from the monitoring after 10 years, consistent with &sect; 23-3-540(H).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant chatted over the Internet with a officer posing as a 14-year-old girl. Defendant sent her pictures of his penis, stated he could show it to her in person, and arranged to meet her. He was arrested at the meeting site. He argued that &sect; 16-15-342 was unconstitutionally overbroad. The high court disagreed. Speech used to further the sexual exploitation of children was not constitutionally protected due to the State's compelling interest in preventing such conduct, and &sect; 16-15-342 was narrowly drafted to prohibit criminal conduct rather than protected speech. Nor was it unconstitutionally vague, as it was sufficiently precise to provide fair notice to those to whom it applied. That an actual minor was not the subject of defendant's intent did not preclude his conviction of either crime. Evidence of his specific intent to commit a sexual battery on a child and an overt act toward the commission of the offense was sufficient to convict him of attempted CSC. Photos of his penis, while offensive, were properly admitted to show his intent. He was not entitled to a charge of attempted assault and battery of an aggravated nature as a lesser included offense of attempted CSC.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother sued respondent father in the Lexington County Family Court (South Carolina) for one child's college expenses, an increase in support for another child, and attorney's fees and costs. The trial court (1) dismissed the claim for college expenses, (2) reduced support for the second child, (3) reduced support payable from the father's bonus, (4) reduced his obligation, and (5) denied attorney's fees and costs. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother said it was error to find making the father pay college expenses violated equal protection. The supreme court agreed because (1) its prior decision finding an equal protection violation wrongly applied strict scrutiny, (2) permitting such an order did not improperly treat divorced parents differently than non-divorced parents, and (3) requiring the payment under limited circumstances was rationally related to a legitimate state interest in ensuring its youth's education. Awarding the father a credit for alleged child support overpayment was error because it was based on an erroneous calculation of the parties' incomes. It was error to reduce the percentage of his bonus payable as child support because the reduction was not explained. It was error to deny the mother's request for attorney's fees and costs because (1) these expenses were at least half her income, while the father's were less than one-third his income, and (2) his conduct caused the litigation, as he did not pay the full amount of his bonus that was due, and his claim that a child did not need support after the age of majority prompted the mother's suit, from which she received significant benefit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was reversed, and the matter was remanded to determine whether and in what amount the father had to contribute to a child's college education.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of a rehire process, the division required, among other things, the employees to sign a form, which provided that they would have a reduction of 13.6 percent in their salary to cover the cost of the division's employer portion of retirement. The trial court dismissed the complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the South Carolina Retirement Contribution Procedures Act (Retirement Act). The trial court also found that the employees did not have a property interest rooted in state law on which their claim could have been based. The appellate court found that the trial court erred in finding that the employees were required to exhaust their administrative remedies under the Retirement Act. Under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 9-21-30, the Retirement Act applied to a dispute between a member and the retirement systems. The complaint here involved neither the retirement systems in general nor any administrative decision by the retirement systems. Because there was no controversy involving the retirement systems, the Retirement Act's administrative remedies were not implicated here. Further, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 9-11-90 provided a basis to assert a property interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Pickens County Court (South Carolina) that convicted him of murder, burglary, criminal sexual conduct, and kidnapping and sentenced him to death, arguing that his guilty plea to the murder charge should be vacated because it was an invalid conditional guilty plea in that defendant was insisting upon being sentenced by a jury and that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raped and murdered a college student in her apartment. He pled guilty to the charges against him, and the trial judge imposed a capital sentence. On review, the court held that defendant did not enter an invalid conditional plea. A review of the plea colloquy revealed that defendant entered his plea knowingly and voluntarily as he repeatedly acknowledged that he understood the charge against him, understood the consequences of his plea, and understood the rights he was waiving by pleading guilty, including the right to have a jury determine his guilt and sentence. Therefore, defendant's plea was valid. The court agreed with defendant that prosecutorial misconduct occurred in that the prosecutors used intimidation on a defense expert, who indicated that she felt threatened by the prosecutors. However, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial because defendant failed to show  prejudice resulting from the prosecutorial misconduct and defendant's sentence of death was not imposed in violation of his due process rights. Lastly, the death sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate to the crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, landlord and tenant, sought review of a decision of the Richland County Circuit Court (South Carolina), upholding appellee city's finding that the landlord and tenant were in violation of Columbia, S.C. City Code &sect; 17-55, which restricted residency in a certain area to no more than three unrelated individuals living together, and that the ordinance was constitutional under the Due Process Clause of the South Carolina Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord's property was occupied by four unrelated young women, all of whom were undergraduate students at the University of South Carolina. The occupants were friends, shared meals and expenses, and operated as a single household. The ordinance defined &quot;family&quot; in part as three unrelated persons residing together as a single housekeeping unit. Appellants argued that this definition arbitrarily and capriciously deprived them of a cognizable property interest in violation of the Due Process Clause, S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. The court found that there was a rational relationship between the ordinance's definition of &quot;family&quot; and the legitimate governmental interests the ordinance sought to further, which was controlling the undesirable qualities associated with mass student congestion. Groups of unrelated persons typically had different living styles in comparison to groups of related persons; limiting the number of unrelated persons who may live together in single family homes furthered the goal of creating family-oriented neighborhoods that were safe and quiet for young children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer's principal place of business was in Missouri; it did business in multiple states. The taxpayer had excluded from its taxable income dividends received from its wholly-owned subsidiaries because, for both federal and South Carolina income tax purposes, such dividends were not subject to income tax under I.R.C. &sect; 243 (2006) or S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-6-1110. The court held that under the matching principle, and given the plain meaning of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-6-2220(2), the taxpayer could not claim deductions for interest expenses related to the dividends that were not related to South Carolina income. The interest expenses were properly allocated to the taxpayer's principal place of business, Missouri. The court held that &sect; 12-6-2220 did not violate the Commerce Clause because it treated all nonresident taxpayers the same; South Carolina could not control the fact that some taxpayers were impacted differently due to the law of their principal places of business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator had a permit to accept construction and demolition (C &amp; D) waste in a neighboring county. The county, through a non-profit corporation, operated a municipal solid waste landfill and a C &amp; D landfill. The court held that the ordinance represented a valid exercise of the county's police powers, as articulated in S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 4-9-25. The South Carolina Solid Waste Policy and Management Act, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 44-96-10 et seq. (2002) (SWPMA), did not expressly or impliedly preempt the county's authority to regulate solid waste. Rather, the SWPMA was laden with references to the counties' involvement in the management and regulation of solid waste, such as S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 44-96-80(A), (J), (K). The ordinance did not conflict with the legislature's intent to require regional planning as demonstrated in S.C. Code Ann. Regs. &sect; 61-107.17.C.3. The ordinance regulating the flow of waste neither frustrated the purpose of the SWPMA, nor interfered with need determination for landfill permitting pursuant to the DON Regulation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The General Assembly passed Act 308, which transferred the oversight of financial operations of the school district from its board of trustees to a finance committee to be appointed by the legislative delegation. The Governor vetoed Act 308. The House of Representatives voted to override the Governor's veto, 33 to 10, as did the Senate, by a vote of 1 to 0. The court rejected the General Assembly's recently-adopted practice of allowing only one member of a local delegation to carry a bill affecting only that locality, which circumvented and violated the mandated two-thirds requirement for overriding a veto in S.C. Const. art. IV, &sect; 21. Because a quorum was present in each house, the veto override votes of 33 to 10 in the House of Representatives and 1 to 0 in the Senate fell short of the constitutionally mandated two-thirds requirement, which required two-thirds of a quorum.

It challenged an order of the Circuit Court, Charleston County (South Carolina), which granted respondents' motion to dismiss under S.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that the circuit court erred when it included matters outside the complaint in deciding respondents' motion to dismiss. In support of its decision to grant the motion to dismiss, the circuit court cited to a South Carolina federal district court case that found the county had a unique geography with nearly one hundred miles of coastline that was divided by rivers and linked by bridges. In using the federal district court case to supply facts from outside the complaint, the circuit court impermissibly went beyond the proper parameters of a motion to dismiss. The school district stated a sufficient cause of action challenging the constitutionality of Act 189 to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. It alleged that the South Carolina Charter Schools Act was a general law that applied uniformly to every county in South Carolina. Furthermore, it alleged that Act 189 improperly singled out only its county as the recipient of special rules for areas covered by the Charter Schools Act without a rational basis for doing so. The circuit court properly dismissed the Governor as a party. The complaint did not demonstrate a nexus between him and Act 189.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a City and four individuals (collectively, the City), challenged an order of the Charleston County Circuit Court (South Carolina) granting a petition for incorporation filed by respondents, a Town, its mayor and an alliance for self-government (collectively, the Town), pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 5-1-24 (Supp. 2010).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Town's third incorporation petition, expressly excluding all properties that were not contiguous under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 5-1-30(A)(4), was insufficient pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 5-1-24 because the inclusion of a significant number of properties was contingent upon a judicial determination, which left the voters unaware of whether large portions of the Town would ever be incorporated. Although the conclusion that the petition was insufficient was dispositive of the case, in the interest of judicial economy, the appellate court reached the remaining issues to provide guidance for future incorporation petitions. It first held that the 2005 amendments to S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 5-1-30(A)(4) were not unconstitutional special legislation because those incorporating and those annexing were not part of the same class and, therefore, the amendments did not result in disparate treatment among class members. Also, courts must adhere to the plain language of the definition of contiguity and require incorporating areas with issues pertaining to contiguity to conceptually eliminate publicly-owned property from the map of their proposed boundaries and determine if the properties would then touch.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order upholding the Town's incorporation. It affirmed the circuit court's conclusion that the incorporation scheme at issue was not unconstitutional special legislation, and its holding that the term &quot;publicly-owned property&quot; did not require fee simple ownership by the federal, state, or county governments. However, it reversed the circuit court's analysis of contiguity, and remanded the matter to the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, two motorcycle accident victims, filed four suits against defendants, the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) and the South Carolina Department of Public Safety (SCDPS) in the Spartanburg County Circuit Court (South Carolina). A jury awarded them $ 1.875 million. The circuit court granted defendants' motion to reduce the verdict to $ 300,000 each, for a total of $ 600,000. The victims appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victims argued that the two-tier cap on damages created by S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 15-78-120 (2005), creating a higher limitation of liability for claims against state physicians and a lower limit for all other state entities, violated Equal Protection. The court held that two hypotheses supported the different classifications: (1) relieving the government from the hardships of unlimited liability; and (2) furthering accountable and competent healthcare while promoting affordable medical liability insurance, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 15-78-20(a), (g) (2005). The circuit court erred, however, in tying the number of occurrences to the number of injuries sustained by the victims. Two independent and separate acts of negligence occurred -- one by SCDOT and one by SCDPS. SCDOT was negligent in not having a re-lamping policy in place, and SCDPS was negligent in not following its own policy to notify a SCDOT technician when a light had burned out. Because there were two separate entities which committed two separate acts of negligence, each agency's act was a separate occurrence, entitling the victims to a combined verdict of $ 1.2 million.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's finding that the two-tier statutory cap on damages was constitutional but reversed the holding that only one occurrence had taken place and ordered that each plaintiff was entitled to $ 600,000, or a combined verdict of $ 1.2 million.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">No contract existed between the State and the retirees, either by way of forms signed or by representations made. The Working Retiree statutes did not create a binding contractual right. Accordingly, summary judgment for the State was proper as to the constitutional issues raised by retirees because those issues were premised on the existence of a contract. However, the circuit court erred in holding that the State was estopped from applying the State Retirement System Preservation and Investment Reform Act, 2005 S.C. Acts 153, which required that retired members pay the employee contribution as if they were active members, but without accruing additional service credit. Under the circumstances, estoppel could not lie against the State, and the retirees failed to establish the elements of equitable estoppel. Any reliance created by the forms, brochures, or statements of the State and its agents did not cause a prejudicial change in the retirees' position. Because the court concluded that the named retirees had neither a contractual nor an equitable remedy, it declined to address the issue of class certification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney sent an e-mail message to opposing counsel in a domestic matter in which the attorney commented on opposing counsel's daughter's drug use and opposing counsel's parenting skills. The court determined that such an e-mail could only inflame the passions of everyone involved, make litigation more intense, and undermine a lawyer's ability to objectively represent his or her client. That kind of personal attack against a family member of opposing counsel with no connection to the litigation brought into question the integrity of the judicial system and prejudiced the administration of justice. Thus, the attorney did violated Rules 8.4(e) and 7(a)(5). In addition, he violated his attorney's oath, which was ground for discipline under Rule 7(a)(6). The civility clause contained within the lawyer's oath was not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. A person of common intelligence does not have to guess at the meaning of the civility oath, and there was no substantial amount of protected free speech penalized by the civility oath. Finally, the court considered the attorney's acknowledgement of misconduct and his sincere remorse in reaching its conclusion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker brought a negligence action after he slipped and fell from a wet ladder while working at the homeowner's home. The trial court denied his request to charge the jury on the definitions of recklessness, willfulness, and wantonness and refused to instruct the jury that heightened forms of wrongdoing could not be compared to ordinary negligence under comparative negligence. The supreme court reversed and remanded, stating that under South Carolina's comparative negligence system, all forms of conduct amounting to negligence, including ordinary negligence, gross negligence, and reckless, willful, or wanton conduct, might be compared to and offset by any conduct that fell short of conduct intended to cause injury or damage. A trial court should therefore instruct the jury on the definitions of those various forms of negligence whenever requested by a party.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that (1) he was denied a fair trial because of a third party's contact with a juror; (2) the state grand jury lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the counts of obtaining property under false pretenses and conspiracy; (3) S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 14-7-1820 (Supp. 2009) violated the constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto laws; and (4) the circuit court abused its discretion by imposing a sentence disproportionate to those of his coconspirators. On appeal, the court found that defendant's first argument failed because defendant did not preserve that issue for review and the court would not apply the plain error rule. In addition, defendant was actually challenging the sufficiency of the indictment when he argued that the grand jury did not have jurisdiction over the counts of obtaining property under false pretenses and conspiracy. Further, because defendant failed to timely challenge these counts in the indictment and instead went to trial on the charges, he could not now, having lost at trial, come back to challenge the sufficiency of the indictment. Finally, defendant did not preserve his ex post facto law and disproportionate sentence arguments.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 63-19-2440.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a rear passenger in a vehicle stopped for a traffic violation. After admitting to the officer that he had consumed two beers, defendant was cited for possession of beer under 21 and for public disorderly conduct. A municipal court convicted defendant of the possession charge. He thereafter appealed his conviction to the circuit court, which upheld the conviction. S.C. Const. art. XVII, &sect;14, prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages to persons under the age of 21 years. Defendant argued that &sect; 63-19-2440 conflicted with S.C. Const. art. XVII, &sect;14, because the statute restricted more than the sale of alcoholic beverages to 18 to 20 year olds by also restricting their possession and consumption. The court disagreed and upheld the conviction. With respect for the principle that every presumption would be made in favor of the constitutionality of a statute, the court construed the term sale broadly. Thus, when the legislature reserved its power to restrict the sale of alcoholic beverages, the court determined that it meant to also reserve its power to restrict the purchase and possession of alcoholic beverages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mayor argued that the governor's veto of one source of appropriated funds while leaving the remainder of the total appropriation, and the specified &quot;objects and purposes&quot; of the appropriation, intact, was unconstitutional under S.C. Const. art. IV, &sect; 21. The court agreed. The result of the governor's veto was that the total appropriation for each of the programs, positions, and expenses was reduced by the amount the general assembly had designated to be drawn from the general fund, but the programs, positions, and expenses themselves were not eliminated. This was an improper modification of legislation. The governor attempted to veto funds arising from a particular source, but he did not veto the purpose to which those funds were allocated. The net effect of the veto was a veto of part of an item, resulting in modification of legislation, which was an unconstitutional exercise of the veto power. The governor was constitutionally permitted to veto an item in its entirety, but not partially.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contracted with hotels to discount their rates for reservations made on its website.

The ALC ruled that under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-36-920, appellant owed a seven percent sales tax on the gross proceeds received from furnishing hotel accommodations in South Carolina.  The high court held that 1) the fees appellant charged were taxable under &sect; 12-36-920(A) as &quot;gross proceeds&quot;; 2) while it did not physically &quot;furnish&quot; accommodations, it was in the business of doing so; and 3) it conducted the business of furnishing accommodations in South Carolina, despite a lack of physical presence there, as it entered into contracts with South Carolina hotels and sent its employees to South Carolina to negotiate such contracts. The tax did not violate the Dormant Commerce Clause ( U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3) as applied to appellant because appellant had a sufficient physical presence in the state, and the tax was fairly apportioned; i.e., it was internally and externally consistent.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was loudly preaching against homosexuality on a public sidewalk. An officer cited defendant for violating Greenville, S.C., Code &sect; 24-32 (1985) after he directed a comment to three young women as they passed by. The appellate court found that the lower court erred in affirming the trial court's denial of defendant's directed verdict motion as to &sect; 24-32(1), (2), (4), (5). The City presented no evidence that, other than through his speech, defendant engaged in any conduct that would disturb or molest others. Further, Greenville, S.C., Code &sect; 24-32(3) was unconstitutionally vague because the words &quot;humiliate,&quot; &quot;insult,&quot; and &quot;scare&quot; were not sufficiently definite to give reasonable notice of the prohibited conduct. This provision was subjective because the words that humiliated, insulted, or scared one person may not have the same effect on another person. Thus, people of common intelligence may have been forced to guess at the provision's meaning and may have differed as to its applicability. Greenville, S.C., Code &sect; 24-32(3) was not precisely written in a way that would notify a person of the certain specific conduct that is prohibited.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant motor vehicle manufacturer appealed a judgment of the Hampton County Circuit Court (South Carolina) in a product liability action upon a jury verdict for plaintiff passenger of $ 16 million in actual damages and $15 million in punitive damages against the manufacturer and the driver of a vehicle in a rollover accident while the passenger was in the back seat of the vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The passenger alleged that a design defect added to the rollover propensity of the vehicle. The court held that the risk-utility test with its requirement of showing a feasible alternative design based on evidence in existence at or before the time of manufacture was the exclusive test to use in a products liability design case. The passenger had to point to a design flaw in the vehicle and show how an alternative design would have prevented the product from being unreasonably dangerous. This alternative design had to account for its associated costs, safety and functionality.  However, while the passenger produced evidence of a feasible alternative design, retrial was necessary. Whether a product was defective had to be measured against information known at the time the product was placed into the stream of commerce. Introduction of post-manufacture evidence and evidence of other rollover accidents with insufficient similarity prejudiced the manufacturer. Also, counsel for the passenger in his closing argument on punitive damages impermissibly asked the jury to punish the manufacturer not only for harm to the passenger but also for harm to others involved in rollover accidents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court in part and remanded for a new trial on liability using the risk-utility test and on damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court declined to consider juror qualification issues because defense counsel used only seven of ten available peremptory strikes. A wiretap placed on the telephone at defendant's home pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-30-95 (2002) once the officers' confrontation with defendant began was constitutional. According to the court, the wiretap was akin to a warrantless search conducted when exigent circumstances demand immediate action. The court also held that admitting a video of funeral rites for one of the murdered officers during sentencing was not error because it was victim impact evidence that showed footage of actual mourners; in addition, its traditional trappings of a law enforcement officer's funeral demonstrated the general loss suffered by society. Ordering defendant to submit to a mental evaluation did not violate his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment or S.C. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate was convicted of murder, kidnapping, armed robbery, and criminal conspiracy. The inmate was sentenced to death for the murders. The state's highest court vacated the life sentences for kidnapping with regard to the murder victims, but affirmed the convictions and remaining sentences. The inmate's petition for post-conviction relief (PCR) was denied by the Horry County Circuit Court (South Carolina).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's petition for a writ of certiorari was granted. The state's highest court held that trial counsel's failure to object to the solicitor's opening statement during the guilt phase, in which he described the inmate, a Muslim, as a domestic terrorist, and his closing argument at sentencing, in which he drew a correlation between September 11, 2001, and the acts for which the inmate was convicted constituted deficient performance. The comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the death sentence a denial of due process. The inmate's actions did not constitute terrorism under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-23-710(18) (Supp. 2009). The statements improperly evoked religious prejudice, and served only to inflame the passions and prejudice of the jury. There was a reasonable probability that counsel's failure to object to the comments affected the death sentence. The inmate received ineffective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VI.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff father brought an action against defendant mother and third-party defendant son in the Kershaw County Family Court (South Carolina), seeking to reduce child support. The mother counterclaimed for the son's college expenses. The trial court denied the father's motion to dismiss based on the Equal Protection clause. The parents were ordered to divide college expenses, and the father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 63-3-530(A)(17) (2007) provided that child support orders terminate when the child reaches age 18, marries, or becomes self-supporting.  However, support could be continued beyond age 18 for certain &quot;exceptional circumstances.&quot; In Risinger v. Risinger, 273 S.C. 36, 253 S.E.2d 652 (1979), it was held that secondary education could be considered such an exceptional circumstance. The court held that the statute, as interpreted by Risinger, violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and South Carolina constitutions, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1; S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. Because the statute only allows for the continuation of support beyond the age of 18, a court could order a parent subject to a support order at the time his or her child reached age 18 to pay college expenses, but could not order a parent not subject to such an order to pay college expenses. There was no rational basis for the varied treatment of the class of parents subject to a support order as compared to those parents not subject to such an order. The statute, as interpreted by Risinger, failed the rational basis test.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner judge filed an action challenging a decision of respondent, the Judicial Merit Selection Commission (JMSC), finding her unqualified for office.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge was elected to the family court in 1993. Her term was set to expire and she applied for re-election with the JMSC; no other individual filed for the judgeship. A disgruntled litigant opposed her re-election. A majority of the JMSC found the judge unqualified, thereby foreclosing the legislature from reelecting her. The judge argued that the composition of the JMSC, established in S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 2-19-10(B), should not include legislators. She also argued that because the disgruntled litigant had filed a grievance that had been dismissed and because the Court of Appeals had affirmed her decision not to recuse herself, which the litigant had challenged, the JMSC, by revisiting the issue, had usurped the power of the judicial branch. The court held that because the JMSC acted in its political capacity, there was no showing of a S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 separation of powers violation. The judge's challenge presented a nonjusticiable political question. Because the JMSC was a constitutional office which exercised part of the sovereign, legislators could properly serve on the JMSC without violating the dual office rule, S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 24 and S.C. Const. art. VI, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant borrower brought a breach of contract and promissory estoppel action against respondent lenders after the borrower's loan application was denied. The Charleston County Circuit Court (South Carolina) granted summary judgment to the lenders, finding that the borrower's claims were barred by the lender statute of frauds, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 37-10-107 (2002). The borrower's motion to alter or amend was denied. The borrower appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The borrower challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 37-10-107, which prohibited certain legal and equitable actions arising out of the loan of money where there was no writing evidencing the parties' alleged agreement. The borrower argued that the exclusion of consumer loans from the statute was not related to the subject of consumer law and, therefore, the statute should not have been located in the Consumer Protection Code. However, &sect; 37-10-107 touched upon consumer issues and gave reasonable notice of the subject matter of the act. Accordingly, the statute did not violate S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 17. With regard to the application of &sect; 37-10-107, the trial court correctly found that the borrower's claims were subject to the writing requirement of the statute because its members sought a loan from the lender for an amount in excess of $ 50,000. None of the documents or exhibits contained any indication of an agreement between the parties as contemplated by &sect; 37-10-107. There were no genuine issues of material fact regarding the borrower's causes of action for breach of contract and promissory estoppel, even when the evidence was viewed in the light most favorable to the borrower.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff buyer sued defendant automobile dealership under common law and state and federal law seeking recovery for damages sustained from his purchase of a defective used truck. Based on a jury's verdict, the Clarendon County Court (South Carolina) awarded the buyer $ 26,371 in actual damages and $ 216,600 in punitive damages. Both parties sought review of the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyer contended that the dealership failed to disclose that the used truck had sustained &quot;wreck&quot; damage from its prior owner; he also contended that the dealership's sales people made numerous false statements about the prior owner, the truck's condition, and applicable warranties prior to his purchase. On appeal, the court upheld admission of the testimony of the buyer's expert witnesses. The dealership was properly denied a judgment notwithstanding the verdict because the buyer's testimony that the truck was not worth anything and his expert's testimony that the truck had a zero retail value established actual damages. However, the buyer was erroneously awarded recovery under the Federal Odometer Act, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 32710(a), since he failed to show a violation of this law with the requisite intent to defraud. The verdicts on the fraud and state law unfair trade practices claims were not inconsistent, and the punitive damage award was not excessive. As to the buyer's cross-appeal, the court found that he was not entitled to prejudgment interest, but that he should have been awarded attorney's fees under the South Carolina Dealer's Act, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 56-15-110(1) (2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial judge's award of $ 1,500 in actual damages and $ 4,500 in attorney's fees awarded the buyer under the Odometer Act and the trial court's denial of his request for attorney's fees and costs under the Dealer's Act and remanded the case for entry of a judgment reflecting these rulings. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

Because no actual injury had occurred, the inmate's meaningful access to the courts had not been unconstitutionally hindered.

After a sentencing hearing conducted by the trial judge, defendant was sentenced to death for the murders and given lesser sentences on the other charges.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant went on a killing spree. He told police he began killing people because an inmate in federal prison had told him he could get him a job as a mafia hit man, but was tired of waiting and embarked on his own killing spree. He told police he would have killed more people if he had had a handgun rather than a shotgun. He shot a homeless man twice for target practice. During sentencing, the trial judge mentioned defendant's young mother and the horrible choices she made with him, hoping that the death sentence had a deterrent effect. Defendant argued that this language demonstrated that his sentence was meant to serve as a deterrent to abusive parents, which was an arbitrary factor in violation of the U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The court held that it was clear from the entirety of the sentencing order that the death sentence was based upon defendant's characteristics and his crimes. Defendant also challenged the constitutionality of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-3-20(C) because he was denied the opportunity to present mitigating evidence to a jury. The court held that the sentencing judge was required to and did consider mitigating factors; defendant's due process rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found, however, that the presumption of personal jurisdiction presumed when a foreign judgment appeared on its face to be a record of a court of general jurisdiction arose not from state case law, but rather from the United States Constitution. This reading of &sect; 15-35-940 arguably violated the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2, and/or the Privileges and Immunities Clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2, cl. 1.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the McCormick County Circuit Court (South Carolina) of taking of hostages by an inmate (S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 24-13-450 (2007)). He appealed, contending that &sect; 24-13-450 was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another inmate handcuffed three corrections officers (COs), two of whom were also assaulted, locked them in a storage locker, and unsuccessfully tried to escape. Defendant argued that as &sect; 24-13-450 did not include the word &quot;unlawfully,&quot; it effectively criminalized lawful activity. The high court held that while defense counsel did not cite the vagueness doctrine in his trial argument, his assertions regarding U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV, and his claim that &sect; 24-13-450 was &quot;almost impossible to defend,&quot; included a due process challenge, and were sufficiently broad to incorporate the vagueness doctrine. Defendant did not have standing to challenge &sect; 24-13-450 for vagueness, as his conduct fell within even the most restrictive application of the statute. He could be found guilty under &sect; 24-13-450 if, by coercion or physical force, he carried away any person as a hostage &quot;or for any other reason whatsoever.&quot; Thus, the COs did not have to be &quot;hostages&quot; for defendant to be convicted. Further, &sect; 24-13-450 was not unconstitutionally vague, as a person of ordinary intelligence and judgment would be sufficiently apprised of conduct that would come within its purview.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owner of property sued respondents town and county, challenging an ordinance adopted by the town which authorized the sale of its water and sewer system to the county. The Dorchester County Master-In-Equity (South Carolina) held that the town was authorized to sell the water and sewer system pursuant to the ordinance. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner alleged that the town's agreement to sell violated S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 5-31-620 (2004) and S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 5-31-640 (2004) because there was no written petition from any residents, qualified registered electors, or freeholders within the town requesting an election on the matter. The appellate court found that there was no compelling interest to support &sect; 5-31-640, and that, thus, it violated the Equal Protection Clause. Municipal utilities, as with other matters that affected public health and safety of the entire community, were of general interest to the community. The owner's argument that property owners were so much more affected by water and sewer system operations than other voters so as to create a compelling state interest in special statutory protection was meritless. Further, &sect; 5-31-620 and &sect; 5-31-640 were mutually dependent and were not severable, and thus &sect; 5-31-620 was also unconstitutional. Pursuant to the authority granted in S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 5-7-40 in conjunction with the expressed legislative intent in S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 5-7-10, the town was fully authorized to sell its water and sewer system pursuant to the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

Although the State had appropriated the funds in its budget, the Governor had not formally applied for them be he disagreed with how the money had to be spent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to an economic recession, the United States Congress passed a law, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub. L. No. 111-5 (ARRA), that permitted State Fiscal Stabilization funds to be paid to the states. The United States Congress specified in the ARRA how the federal funds were to be spent. The General Assembly appropriated the funds in its budget, and indicated an intent to accept and spend the funds as directed under the ARRA. The Governor disagreed with how the funds had to be spent and vetoed provisions of the budget, including the ARRA funds, but the General Assembly overrode the vetoes. However, the Governor did not formally apply to receive the funds because he still claimed an absolute discretion to determine how the funds were to be spent. The aggrieved parties sought declarations from the state supreme court that the Governor had to request, accept, and distribute the funds. The state supreme court issued a writ of mandamus directing the Governor to apply for them and see to it that the State received them, as it was his job under S.C. Const. art. IV, &sect; 15 to see that the laws were executed and not to determine what the law should be.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners institute and corporation filed a complaint against respondents State, legislators, and others, seeking a declaratory judgment that 2008 S.C. Acts 338, &sect; 3 (Act), found at S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 12-28-340, 12-36-2120, was unconstitutional as violating the one subject provision of S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 17. Intervenor association was added as a party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The institute and the corporation argued that &sect; 3 of the Act violated the one subject rule. The State and the legislators did not contend that &sect; 3 was related to the other sections, but submitted that &sect;&sect; 1, 2 related to one subject. The association argued that all three sections of the Act pertained to one subject since (1) &sect;&sect; 1, 2 provided tax exemptions while &sect; 3 protected a tax credit and (2) all three sections provided a direct benefit to businesses. The court disagreed. While &sect;&sect; 1, 2 set forth tax exemptions, protection of a tax credit was not mentioned in &sect; 3. Instead, &sect; 3 required, among other things, that motor fuel terminals offer petroleum products that had not been blended with ethanol. It was also significant that the heading for &sect; 3, found in the body of the Act, made no mention of taxes, though the headings for &sect;&sect; 1, 2 did so explicitly. The provisions of the Act did not relate to one subject, and it violated S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 17. To sever only part of the Act would have required the court to go beyond its proper role and to intrude into the province of the legislature. Thus the entire Act was found in violation of S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 17.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty in the Cherokee County Circuit Court (South Carolina) to manufacturing methamphetamine, second offense, and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. As part of a plea agreement, an accompanying possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine charge was dismissed. Defendant's application for postconviction relief was denied. Defendant filed a petition for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's plea was enhanced to a second offense by defendant's prior conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia. Defendant contended that his plea was improperly enhanced and that he did not receive effective assistance of counsel as his plea counsel neither challenged the State of South Carolina's reliance on the paraphernalia conviction for enhancement purposes, nor informed defendant of the potential challenge. On appeal, the court found that defendant's conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia could not be used for enhancement purposes as it did not relate to drugs as statutorily mandated by S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 44-53-470 and 44-53-375(B)(2) (Supp. 2007). Further, plea counsel's failure to inform defendant of the potential challenge to the use of the paraphernalia conviction for enhancement purposes amounted to deficient representation under the Sixth Amendment. Moreover, defendant established prejudice from the representation as he repeatedly said at the postconviction hearing that he would have gone to trial had he known that his paraphernalia conviction did not qualify as a prior offense for enhancement purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant postconviction relief and returned him to his pre-guilty plea position, defendant's conviction and sentence for manufacturing methamphetamine were vacated, and the accompanying indictment for possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine was restored as an active charge. The charges were remanded to the general sessions court for disposition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city provided its employees with retirement pay and other post-employment benefits (OPEBs). A regulation of the South Carolina Governmental Accounting Standards Board allowed a city to pay its annual required contribution into an irrevocable trust established to earn a return sufficient to meet all current and future OPEBs obligations. The municipal association established the trust to receive funds from municipalities, to invest those funds in a way seeking the highest rate of return, and to disburse those funds in order to defray the future expenses of OPEBs. The city indicated that it would invest in the trust only on the condition that the investment portfolio included equity securities. The high court held the city's investment in the trust was designed to circumvent S.C. Const. art. X, &sect; 11, which precluded political subdivisions from investing funds intended for post-employment benefits in equity securities. Because the obvious purpose of the trust was to invest in equity securities and attempt to circumvent the constitutional prohibition on doing so, it had an illegal purpose and therefore violated S.C.

Defendant argued that the CSP statute,&nbsp;S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 24-21-560(D) (2007), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to distribution of crack cocaine. After serving 85 percent of his term of imprisonment, defendant was released to the CSP. Defendant argued that the revocation from the CSP resulted in the imposition of a greater sentence than his original sentence without the benefit of the requisite constitutional protections. The supreme court held that the circuit court erred in re-incarcerating defendant because he had served 85 percent of the original sentence and 19 months as a result of several CSP revocations. Defendant had not received notice that the terms of his original sentence would be modified and that a greater punishment would be imposed. Although he was not convicted a second time, he was given an additional sentence for violating the CSP. Section 24-21-560(D) limited the total amount of time an inmate could be incarcerated after a CSP revocation to the length of the remaining balance of the sentence for the no parole offense. A circuit court could not impose a sentence for a CSP revocation that would result in an inmate being incarcerated for an aggregate period of time that extended beyond the unsuspended portion of the original sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that 2007 S.C. Act. 49, &sect;&sect; 3 and 4 violated S.C. Const. art.

However, those provisions were severable from the remainder of Act 49, and the surviving sections of the Act could stand alone. The purposes of Act 49 could be complied with by upholding the Critical Needs Nursing Initiative Act. The supreme court found that 2007 S.C.

The remaining sections of Act 83 sufficiently related to the goals of promoting hydrogen and alternative energy as to fall within the ambit of the Act. 2007 S.C. Act 110, &sect; 57 was relevant to the stated title of the Research and Development Tax Credit Reform Act and did not violate the one-subject rule. The majority of 2007 S.C.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant representative sued respondents, the State of South Carolina and South Carolina Department of Revenue, in the Beaufort County Circuit Court (South Carolina), for a putative class of persons denied a state sales tax exemption. The court granted summary judgment against the representative on his cause of action under the South Carolina Taxpayers' Bill of Rights and dismissed the remaining causes of action. The representative appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The representative contended that the South Carolina Department of Revenue improperly promulgated regulations that did not conform to S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-36-2120(28)(b) (Supp. 2007) because the regulations allowed a sales tax exemption only for diabetic supplies sold pursuant to a prescription or written authorization, which the representative claimed was not required under the statute. On appeal, the court found that the representative's allegations regarding the promulgation of regulations by the Department of Revenue in disregard of &sect; 12-36-2120(28)(b) failed to state a cause of action under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-58-170 (2000) (repealed 2005) because &sect; 12-58-170 specifically referred to disregarding Department of Revenue's published procedures which did not include the alleged disregard of a statute. Moreover, the trial court properly refused injunctive or mandamus relief as provided in S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-60-60 (Supp. 2007). However, the representative was entitled to pursue the issue as an action in circuit court under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 1-23-150 (2005) for a declaratory judgment that the regulations exceeded the Department of Revenue's authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for, among other things, possession of a pistol by a person under 21 years of age pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-23-30 (2003 &amp; Supp. 2007). He filed a motion to quash the indictment on the ground that &sect; 16-23-30 was unconstitutional. The State challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of York County (South Carolina), which granted the motion to quash.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that because he was old enough to be sui juris, and S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 granted him the right to bear arms, he could not be charged with a crime for handgun possession. The supreme court held that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-23-30 (2003 &amp; Supp. 2007) did not violate S.C. Const. Art. I, &sect; 20. Although a person under the age of 21 was prohibited from possessing a handgun, that did not prevent a person under the age of 21 from possessing other types of guns. Defendant also argued that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-23-30 (2003 &amp; Supp. 2007) violated S.C. Const. art. XVII, &sect; 14 because the age group of 18 to 20-year-olds was treated differently than adults. The supreme court found that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-23-30 (2003 &amp; Supp. 2007) violated the plain language of S.C. Const. art. XVII, &sect; 14. By expressly allowing the regulation of the sale of alcoholic beverages to the 18 to 20-year-old age group, and not stating any other situation in which the general assembly could restrict the rights of that age group, art. XVII, &sect; 14 precluded the general assembly from prohibiting that age group's possession of handguns.</SPAN></P>

At the second trial, a jury convicted her of that charge. The state supreme court affirmed. The trial court then found on petitioner's application for postconviction relief that trial counsel had not been ineffective. The state supreme court found that (1) counsel provided an inadequate defense in the second trial by presenting an expert witness who bolstered the State's theory of the cause of death, (2) counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate contradictory medical evidence and an expert's opinion ruling out natural causes of death, (3) counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the jury charge on criminal intent, and (4) counsel was ineffective for failing to offer an autopsy report into evidence.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 24-21-560(D), was unconstitutional given a revocation from the CSP resulted in the imposition of a greater sentence than his original sentence without the benefit of the requisite constitutional protections. The instant court agreed. If, as in defendant's case, successive revocations were ordered, the two-year period could produce a never-ending cycle of participation in CSP and an incarceration period which would clearly exceed or extend past the originally ordered term of incarceration. As a result, defendant's procedural due process rights were violated by the circuit court's order. Although defendant was on notice that the completion of the CSP was a requirement of his originally-imposed sentence, he would not have been aware that his participation in this program could potentially be in perpetuity. Furthermore, a literal interpretation of the CSP statute would improperly permit a CSP violation to become a separate and distinct criminal offense from that which a defendant was convicted without the benefit of the requisite Sixth Amendment constitutional protections.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent restaurants and bars filed a declaratory judgment action against appellant city in the Greenville County Circuit Court (South Carolina), contending that Greenville, S.C., Ordinance No. 2006-91 was invalid and requesting injunctive relief. The court issued an order declaring that the ordinance was both unconstitutional and preempted by South Carolina law, and permanently enjoined the city from enforcing the ordinance. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the State of South Carolina enacted the South Carolina Clean Indoor Air Act of 1990, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 44-95-10 et seq. (2002), the city enacted Greenville, S.C., Ordinance No. 2006-91 to more comprehensively regulate smoking in public places. The city argued that the ordinance was not preempted by South Carolina law and was consistent with both the Constitution and the general law of the State of South Carolina. On appeal, the court found that Act 445 amended S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 44-95-20, but did not preempt the city from enacting the ordinance, and the trial court erred when it isolated a phrase from S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-17-504 and interpreted it in such a way as to accomplish preemption under the Clean Indoor Air Act. Moreover, the Clean Indoor Air Act did not preempt the entire field of indoor smoking. In addition, the ordinance did not violate S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 14 because the city did not seek to criminalize any conduct. As such, the ordinance did not set aside the criminal laws of the State of South Carolina.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that resentencing him would have triggered the no-parole clause in S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 24-21-640 (2007), thereby thwarting his plea agreement in which the State agreed that he would be eligible for parole. However, defendant's interpretation of the statute that the remand of his sentences was a subsequent conviction rendering him ineligible for parole led to an absurd result. Thus, specific performance of the plea bargain could still be accomplished. Moreover, the State had affirmatively stated its intent to comply with the plea bargain. Defendant's argument that he was entitled to choose between resentencing or a new trial failed as the State had not violated the agreement. It was only the way the plea judge structured the sentence that rendered defendant parole ineligible. Finally, defendant had received the benefit of his bargain even though the death sentence later became unconstitutional for minors where the parties had agreed to structure the sentence such that he was eligible for parole. The order was modified to the extent the circuit court made findings inconsistent with the parole board's authority and the Ex Post Facto Clause.</SPAN></P>

The court entered an order of protection from domestic abuse in favor of the wife and denied the husband's motion for reconsideration. The husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband challenged the issuance of the family court's order on due process grounds under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. First, he contended that permitting the hearing under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 20-4-50 within 24 hours of the service of the petition violated due process. Secondly, he asserted that the family court's denial of his motion for a continuance constituted an abuse of discretion and violated his right to due process as he was prohibited from procuring counsel. On appeal, the court found that the husband was provided procedural due process prior to the issuance of the order of protection. However, the order of protection issued pursuant to the emergency hearing was temporary and did not represent a final adjudication of the merits of the action. Therefore, the finding of physical abuse was not a final adjudication and was not to be used against the husband in future litigation. Finally, neither the South Carolina Protection from Domestic Abuse Act, nor the family court's decision denying the husband a continuance constituted a violation of the Equal Protection Clauses under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was modified to make the issuance of the order of protection a temporary order, rather than a final adjudicative order, and, as modified, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Richland County, South Carolina, awarded attorneys' fees of $8.66 million to counsel for plaintiffs, the participants in a teachers and employee retention incentive program (TERI plaintiffs), under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 15-77-300 (2005) (the state action statute). Both parties, the TERI plaintiffs, and defendants, the State and the state retirement system, sought appellate review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the State and the retirement system breached an unambiguous contract with the TERI plaintiffs by applying the requirements of 2005 S.C. Acts 1697, to them, there was no reasonable basis in law or fact on which to defend the breach of the contract with certain TERI participants. As such, the State and the retirement system were not substantially justified in pressing their claim, and the TERI plaintiffs were entitled to attorneys' fees under the state action statute. However, the circuit judge's award of attorneys' fees using the percentage-of-the-recovery method was improper and resulted in an award that was unreasonable under the state action statute. Thus, the award of $8.66 million to counsel for the TERI plaintiffs was vacated. A reasonable award of attorneys' fees was properly calculated using the lodestar method, enhanced by a multiplier and the addition of counsel's expenses to reflect the actual amount of work performed, expenses incurred, and the benefit obtained for all of the old TERI participants. Based on a calculation representative of this conclusion, reasonable attorneys' fees in the amount of $445,226.60 was assessed to the State and the retirement system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit judge's decision to award attorneys' fees under the state action statute was affirmed, but the amount awarded was vacated and reduced using a lodestar calculation and an appropriate modifier.</SPAN></P>

It further directed the grandmother to pay part of the stepfather's attorney fees, and ruled that both parties pay fees of the guardians ad litem equally. Both parties appealed. The state supreme court certified the appeals from the appellate court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A woman gave birth to a son, the stepson and soon thereafter married the stepfather. Seven years after the stepson was born, the woman and stepfather had a biological child together. A few years later, the woman committed suicide. The woman's mother, the grandmother, sought custody of the stepson and visitation with the biological daughter. The family court ruled that the stepfather could adopt the stepson and the grandmother could have visitation with the two children. Because the grandmother could earn a substantial living, the trial court had her pay part of the stepfather's attorney fees but concluded that the guardian ad litem fees should be divided evenly. The state supreme court found that the stepfather had established a psychological parent relationship with the child. It also found that the statute allowing the grandmother to have visitation, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 20-7-420(A)(33) (Supp. 2006), was not facially unconstitutional and awarding the grandmother visitation was in the best interests of the children to further their relationship with the mother's family. It further found that the attorney fee and guardian ad litem decisions were proper under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Greenville County Circuit Court (South Carolina) denied defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment, he was convicted of engaging in a scheme to commit securities fraud and 22 counts of securities fraud.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the chairman of a company that sold debentures to the public and transferred the sale proceeds to its parent company. There was evidence defendant knew of the parent company's dire financial state, but misled investors with false assurances of its profitability. The appellate court held that as defendant was not compelled to appear before the state securities commissioner, or to answer questions before the commissioner's representatives, his pretrial statements to them did not entitle him to immunity. As he was not in custody when he made the statements, Miranda did not apply. There was no evidence the State pursued a civil action investigation solely to obtain evidence for a criminal prosecution. The trial court properly instructed the jury that defendant committed securities fraud if he intentionally misled investors, or knew that there was a danger his conduct would mislead them. A co-author of the State's primary practice manual on corporate law was qualified to testify as an expert on securities laws. The trial court properly excluded a bankruptcy examiner's report as hearsay, refused to dismiss the indictment, and denied defendant's request for a continuance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued the failure of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-3-740(B) to require a probable cause determination resulted in an unconstitutional invasion of his privacy. The appellate court disagreed. The special needs exception allowed a search unsupported by probable cause when special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement, made the warrant and probable cause requirements of the Fourth Amendment impracticable. The State had a valid interest in protecting the health and safety of victims, and a special need existed which allowed the State to test pursuant to the statute. Defendant also claimed that &sect; 16-3-740(B) was unconstitutionally vague, inasmuch as it allowed testing without regard to the timing of an alleged crime. The appellate court disagreed. Defendant's arguments regarding the timing of testing addressed evidentiary concerns in the context of the criminal proceeding, but were not relevant in light of the State's interest in preventing the spread of HIV and Hepatitis B and the State's interest in protecting the health of alleged victims. These interests were advanced regardless of the time of testing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was the constitutionality of 2005 S.C. Acts 207 (1961) (Act), and whether the circuit court erred in ruling that the members lacked standing to challenge the same and that they had not met the requirements of demonstrating a need for an injunction. The appeals court first held that it was error for the circuit court to rule that the members lacked standing merely because their suit was filed after their terms expired. But, because the members also sought a declaratory judgment seeking to declare the Act unconstitutional, which the circuit court did not reach in light of its finding regarding standing, the appeals court reviewed that issue in the interest of judicial economy. In so doing, the court found that the Act took the authority to recommend county recreation commission members away from the Richland County Legislative Delegation, and gave that authority to the Richland County Council. The Act also sought to devolve appointment authority of a local body away from the Legislative Delegation, and confer it upon the County Council. Hence, the Act was found to be unconstitutional special legislation, in violation of S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 1 and 7.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayers filed a class action against respondents, the county, the county organizations, and the county officials, in the Georgetown County Circuit Court (South Carolina), alleging that the county had unlawfully imposed excessive taxes on their real and personal property. The circuit court dismissed the action. The Court of Appeals of South Carolina affirmed the dismissal. The taxpayers filed a request for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers sought a refund because of excessive millage regarding the funding of the county's school district. In addition, they captioned the case as a class action. The state supreme court found that the South Carolina Revenue Procedures Act (RPA), S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-60-10 et seq. (2000 &amp; Supp. 2006), provided an administrative remedy in the form of a refund for both real and personal property taxes under S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 12-60-2560 and 12-60-2940 (2000). Thus, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 12-60-20 and 12-60-80 (Supp. 2006) of the RPA, the taxpayers were required to exhaust their administrative remedies before proceeding to the circuit court. However, the circuit court neither certified a class nor denied class certification. Moreover, class action status was not presented as an issue to the intermediate appellate court. Therefore, the issue, on the merits, was unpreserved for review. Nonetheless, certain language in the intermediate appellate court's opinion could have been construed as commenting on the substance of the issue. Only when the class certification issue was argued could the issue have been preserved for subsequent appellate review and comment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the taxpayers' request for a writ of certiorari, affirmed the dismissal of the lawsuit for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and vacated the intermediate appellate court's judgment to the extent that it addressed the unpreserved class action issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In post decree proceedings between a father and a mother, and while a previous appeal was pending, the Beaufort County Family Court (South Carolina) entered multiple orders addressing various issues, which were appealed by the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that all orders should have been vacated because, by the time this action was filed he had moved to Georgia while the mother and the parties' son lived in North Carolina. The appellate court disagreed. The father's ordered obligations to pay support and medical expenses were not stayed by the appeal, and the trial court retained jurisdiction to enforce those payments. The trial court retained jurisdiction to enforce the provision requiring the father to pay his share of the child's uncovered medical expenses during the appeal. The trial court did not err by requiring both parties to split the costs for these expenses. By first requiring the father to videotape the administration of medicine as a condition of his visitation, and then by suspending the father's overnight visitation for failure to comply with that condition, the trial court improperly issued orders that were affected by a matter on appeal. The failure of the family court to appoint a GAL strictly for medical advisement did not constitute an abuse of discretion. The contempt sentence was improperly based on the void videotaping order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order requiring the father to pay his share of medical expenses, the order requiring both parents to share non-medical and educational expenses, and the denial of the father's request for a medical GAL were affirmed. The suspension of the father's overnight visitation, and the finding of contempt for violating an order that was void for lack of jurisdiction were reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether appellant's guilty pleas were invalid as conditional guilty pleas. Appellant had challenged the constitutionality of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-17-420 (2005) by moving to quash. The trial court denied the motion. Appellant had stipulated to the fact that if the statute was constitutional, that his conduct violated it. The State conceded at oral argument that appellant's pleas were conditional. The appellate court ruled that a trial court was not permitted to accept a conditional plea. Accordingly, the trial court erred by accepting the conditional pleas to the charges of disturbing schools. Appellant did not appeal his guilty plea to malicious injury to property, therefore, that plea was unaffected by his entering conditional pleas to the disturbing school charges. Further, appellant's no contest plea to threatening a public official was not entered as a conditional plea; therefore, it was not vacated. Appellant's sentence was vacated because it was a combination sentence for all of the charges against him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile sought review of a decision of the Greenwood County, South Carolina, Family Court, upholding the constitutionality of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-17-420 (2003), under U.S. Const. amend. I, and, in accordance with appellee State's juvenile petition, adjudicating him delinquent for violating the statute, committing him to 90 days in the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice, and imposing one year of probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that &sect; 16-17-420 was unconstitutionally overly broad because it punished a substantial amount of protected free speech in relation to its plainly legitimate sweep. But the statute did not prohibit the kind of clearly expressive conduct historically subject to overbreadth adjudication in the school context. By its terms, the statute did not apply to protected speech, and it did not broadly regulate conduct. Instead, &sect; 16-17-420 criminalized conduct that disturbed or interfered with schools, or was obnoxious. Such conduct was not protected by the First Amendment and so &sect; 16-17-420 was not a substantial threat to protected speech requiring overbreadth adjudication. Appellant also argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. However, appellant did not have standing to make a facial vagueness challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 16-17-420. His disruptive classroom conduct fell within the most narrow application of &sect; 16-17-420, and he had prior notice that the conduct was prohibited. Since appellant did not have standing to challenge &sect; 16-17-420 on grounds of vagueness, the family court's ruling that &sect; 16-17-420 was not unconstitutionally vague was vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the family court's decision that &sect; 16-17-420 was not unconstitutionally overbroad, but vacated the family court's decision that the statute was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The appellants challenged the grant of summary judgment to the appellees.</SPAN></P>

The physicians and the physical therapists claimed that a physician could lawfully employ a therapist and refer patients to that therapist, while the associations alleged violations of constitutional rights. On appeal, the court found that &sect; 40-45-110(A)(1) prohibited a physical therapist from working as an employee of a physician when the physician referred patients to the therapist for services. Additionally, the Board's endorsement of the Attorney General's opinion was not improper rule making as it was not a regulation under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 1-23-10(4) (2005). Moreover, the interpretation of the statute did not improperly infringe upon physical therapists' right to practice medicine under S.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Greenwood County Circuit Court (South Carolina) revoked appellant's probationary sentence. Appellant claimed on appeal that the trial court erred in revoking his probation based on his association with a person who had a criminal record. He argued that the condition was so overly broad that it violated due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the standard probation condition that a probationer not associate with a person with a criminal record. It was not so overly broad that it violated due process in all cases or in appellant's case. It implicitly required a finding that a probationer knew the person in question had a criminal record during the period of association and that the association was not simply an unknowing or incidental encounter. The State had to show that a probationer intentionally had knowing and substantial contact with a person who had a criminal record or that the probationer developed a significant or meaningful relationship with that person over a substantial period of time. The evidence here was that appellant associated with a second man, who had a criminal record, when both were involved in an illicit drug transaction that ended in a shooting. Appellant's car, which appellant drove to the hospital, arrived on the scene immediately after the shooting. The record showed a substantial and significant contact between appellant and the second man during a criminal transaction, not an unknowing or incidental encounter. Thus, there was sufficient evidence to support the revocation.</SPAN></P>

The Richland County Probate Court (South Carolina) granted the request for an elective share but found the trust was not illusory pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 62-7-112 (Supp. 2004).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court construed S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 62-7-112 (Supp. 2004) to prohibit a finding that a revocable inter vivos trust was illusory when a settlor retained substantial control of the trust, and concluded the statutory provision accordingly modified prior case law. The appellate court found that this construction was erroneous. The second sentence of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 62-7-112 clearly conveyed that no part of the statute, including the first sentence, should have been construed to prevent a finding that a revocable inter vivos trust was illusory for purposes of the elective share. Decedent retained substantial control because he retained such extensive powers over the assets of the trust that he had until his death the same rights in the assets after creation of the trust that he had before its creation. The trust at issue was illusory and thus invalid for elective share purposes, but remained valid for all other purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district and the chairmen contended that the county's two-tiered school governance system violated the Equal Protection Clause, under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and the South Carolina Constitution's guarantees of no taxation without representation, under S.C. Const. Art. X, &sect; 5, and uniform taxation within a jurisdiction, under S.C. Const. Art. X, &sect; 6, because of the county board's review authority over individual school districts' budgets. On appeal, the court found that the State's establishment of the two-tiered school governance in the county did not result in vote dilution and therefore did not offend the Equal Protection Clause's guarantee of one person, one vote. Further, the mere fact that voters in the individual school districts directly elected fewer than all of the county board members who made decisions affecting those districts did not subject those voters to taxation without representation in violation S.C. Const. art. X, &sect; 5. Finally, the special levies exception to the uniformity requirement in S.C. Const. art. X, &sect;&nbsp;6 applied to the school districts because the districts received special benefits from the school taxes.</SPAN></P>

The foundation and the citizen argued that the trial court erred in determining that the issue was nonjusticiable. The state supreme court found that S.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 27, in unequivocal terms, vested the power to determine the qualifications for judicial candidates in the South Carolina General Assembly. In addition, pursuant to the Constitution, the General Assembly had established criteria in S.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cruise ship operator applied for a license to offer gambling cruises from the town. The cruise ship operator filed a declaratory judgment action against the town, contending that Edisto Beach, S.C., Code &sect; 58-138 was preempted by the State Constitution, and seeking to have the ordinance set aside. The County Court had granted the cruise ship operator's motion for summary judgment after finding that the town ordinance was not preempted by the Johnson Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1171, et seq. The County Court had based its summary judgment on its finding that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 5-7-30 (2004) allowed ordinances that were not inconsistent with the state Constitution, and that because S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 14 established that criminal laws, penalties, and sanctions were preempted by State law, the County Court had properly found that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court observed that it had previously held that a cruise such as that offered by the cruise ship operator was a legal activity and that the Gambling Cruise Prohibition Act, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 3-11-200(A), specifically allowed the type of activity offered by the cruise ship operator.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant retiree participants brought an action against appellees, the State of South Carolina and the South Carolina Retirement System, in the Richland County Circuit Court (South Carolina), for breach of contract, estoppel, and violations of the Takings and Due Process Clauses of the South Carolina and Federal Constitutions. The participants requested for the case to be heard in the Supreme Court of South Carolina's original jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The participants were either South Carolina Teacher and Employee Retention Incentive Program (TERI) participants or working retiree participants who retired before July 1, 2005 under the old TERI program, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 9-1-2210 (Supp. 2004), or the old working retiree statute,&nbsp;S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 9-1-1790 (Supp. 2004). They claimed that the requirement in the South Carolina State Retirement System Preservation and Investment Reform Act, 2005 S.C. Acts 1697, that they contribute a percentage of their annual salary to the retirement program was a breach of contract. They also asserted that the State was estopped from requiring further contributions due to their reliance on the terms of the former programs. The court found that the South Carolina Legislature bound itself to the terms in the old TERI statute. Thus, the State could not unilaterally alter its agreement with the old TERI program participants by forcing them to make contributions. Further, the old working retiree statute did not create a binding contract between the State and the working retirees prohibiting the State from altering the statute exempting them from further contributions to the retirement system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared that the State unlawfully breached its contract with the participants in the old TERI program. In addition, the court remanded the working retiree participants' breach of contract claim to the trial court for a case by case factual determination of whether any actions of the State with regard to individual working retirees constituted a breach of contract.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 14, to a jury trial in the civil forfeiture proceeding to determine whether the machine was an illegal gambling device because the device, at the moment of seizure, was deemed an item of contraband per se.

Plaintiff appealed the Anderson County Circuit Court's (South Carolina) failure to allow damages for the railroad's violation of &sect; 58-17-3420; the railroad cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was riding in a car that was struck by a train as the car crossed the tracks. Arsonists' destruction of a bridge over the tracks obliged motorists to use the crossing. The trial judge, sitting in equity and reviewing plaintiff 's &sect; 58-17-3420 claim, found that the railroad's failure to replace the bridge was not the proximate cause of the accident. The appellate court agreed, finding there was no &quot;continuous operation&quot; linking the destroyed bridge and the accident. The prejudicial admission before the jury of evidence relevant only to the bridge replacement issue, and plaintiff's use of this in closing, entitled the railroad to a new trial. Evidence that the railroad clear cut vegetation near the crossing was inadmissible as a subsequent remedial measure (S.C. R. Evid. 407). In view of evidence that the engineer failed to sound his horn for the statutorily prescribed distance, and that vegetation at the crossing was so overgrown as to obstruct motorists' view of oncoming trains, the issue of punitive damages was properly submitted to the jury. But evidence of acts unrelated to crossing safety in South Carolina was not constitutionally permissible under Campbell.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city, and others, brought an original action against defendant county, and others, challenging the constitutionality of a tax ordinance enacted by the county pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-37-223A (Supp. 2004).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An earlier county ordinance had been invalidated because it was inconsistent with S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-37-223A (Supp. 2004). The county then adopted its current ordinance tracking the language of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-37-223A. The appellate court found that S.C. Const. art. X, &sect; 3 mandated statewide uniformity in property tax exemptions enacted by the general assembly. Where the South Carolina Constitution required statewide uniformity, a local option law was not valid. S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-37-223A (Supp. 2004) was patently invalid since it enacted an exemption that was not uniform throughout the state. The court declared S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-37-223A unconstitutional and held that the county's ordinance was therefore invalid.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that impanelment documents, including the State of South Carolina's petition, supporting materials, and the impaneling judge's order, could be released to defendant prior to trial upon timely request or to defendant in a postconviction relief proceeding. The State could redact information not related to a particular defendant's case or information concerning other persons or matters under consideration by the state grand jury. Release of the documents could be appropriate because (1) S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 14-7-1770 (Supp. 2003) was not a complete prohibition on the release of the information; (2) release of the documents usually was not prohibited by secrecy provisions or other concerns following the issuance of a true bill of indictment; and (3) defendant had the right to review the documents to determine whether to timely challenge the legality of the state grand jury which indicted him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that as a function of the incorporation of the town, which overlapped certain areas in the election district, the territorial boundaries of the election district were reduced such that the town residents should have been prohibited from participating in district elections. After the filing of the appeal, in a separate case, the appellate court found the town to be a nullity because it had been created by unconstitutional special legislation. In this case, the appellate court found that the earlier opinion nullifying the town rendered this case nonjusticiable. While the questions involved could have arisen again, the questions did not &quot;usually become moot&quot; before they could have been reviewed. Further, the issues involved did not appear to present a &quot;recurring dilemma&quot; which the appellate court needed to address to clarify the law. The case did not fit within the public importance exception to mootness because there was no imperative or manifest urgency in obtaining a decision on whether the town residents can vote in the district's election when the town did not exist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State asserted defendant's prior murder conviction and physical torture as statutory grounds for the death penalty. Questioning defendant about his waiver of his right to a jury trial, the trial court told him jurors would sometimes lie about their willingness to impose the death penalty so as to get on the jury and ensure that it would not be imposed. The supreme court held that by making these comments, the trial court improperly injected its personal opinion into defendant's decision to waive a jury trial. The error was fundamental and prejudicial and required reversal of defendant's guilty plea. Ring did not involve jury-trial waivers and was not implicated when a defendant pled guilty. S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-3-20(B) was not unconstitutional in light of Ring, and a capital defendant could be sentenced by a judge after knowingly and voluntarily waiving his right to a jury trial. Aggravating circumstances listed in &sect; 16-3-20(C)(a) (2003) were not elements of murder and did not have to be alleged in the indictment. As the State identified the aggravating circumstances and evidence it intended to use, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to sentence defendant to death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant failed to stop his moped for a police officer who had activated his lights and siren, the officer blocked the moped with the police vehicle. Witnesses saw defendant fire gunshots in the police officer's driver's side window, flee on the moped, and then get into another vehicle driven by someone else. A jury convicted defendant of murder and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the court held that the trial court had a reasonable basis for discharging a black juror who was initially adamant that she could not vote for the death penalty in any situation. Although the potential juror later said that she could impose the death penalty, she admitted that she changed her mind due to defense counsel's appeal to her to help make the jury racially balanced. Defendant was not entitled to a jury charge on voluntary manslaughter because the officer's conduct in making a lawful stop did not constitute adequate provocation. Defendant's argument that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction was rejected because aggravating circumstances did not have to alleged in the indictment for murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action that appellant property owners brought against respondents, a county and a planning commission, to challenge a Unified Development Ordinance (UDO), the property owners appealed from a summary judgment that was entered in favor of respondents by the Charleston County Circuit Court (South Carolina). The property owners asserted claims for due process and equal protection violations and for an unlawful taking without compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the UDO was adopted, the county placed notices in the local newspaper, sent notices to property owners, and held numerous public meetings. The property owners alleged that they were denied due process because conspicuous notice was not posted adjacent to the property affected. On appeal, the court held that such conspicuous notice was not required by S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 6-29-760 (2004) because the UDO did not involve rezoning. Because the adoption of the UDO was merely the enactment of a zoning ordinance, notice in the newspaper was sufficient. The court further determined that the property owners' actual notice of the proposed UDO was sufficient notice. Respondents were entitled to summary judgment on the property owners' takings claim because the owners did not demonstrate that they were, even temporarily, denied all economically viable use of their land. The complaint merely alleged that the owners could not sell their property for fair market value and that the UDO severely restricted subdivision. By not asserting before the circuit county that the UDO resulted in the division of citizens into unlawful racial groups, the owners failed to preserve this argument for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant kidnapped a six-year-old boy, raped him, and strangled him to death. Upon the court's inquiry he said he understood that by pleading guilty he waived his right to a jury trial on both guilt and sentencing. He presented evidence that he was mentally ill, which the State countered; the trial court ruled he was not &quot;guilty but mentally ill.&quot; He claimed his plea was conditional because he pled guilty while deferring the decision whether to present evidence of mental illness. The appellate court disagreed, noting that he never attempted to reserve the right to later deny his guilt, but only to present evidence that he committed the crime while mentally ill. That his death sentence was imposed by a judge rather than a jury did not violate Ring because Ring was not implicated when a defendant pled guilty. As S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-19-30 (2003) did not require the indictment to list aggravating circumstances, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction. The sentence was not the result of passion or other arbitrary factors. The evidence supported the findings of aggravation; and in relation to sentences in similar cases, it was neither excessive nor disproportionate to the crime.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to six months of imprisonment. Following his release into a community supervision program (CSP), defendant's supervising agent swore out a warrant for CSP violations. The Spartanburg County Circuit Court (South Carolina) revoked defendant's CSP and sentenced him to five months and seven days of imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 24-21-560(D) (Supp. 2003) limited his sentence for revocation to the remaining time left on his original sentence for the substantive crime. The appellate court held that a plain reading of the statute provided that for a successive revocation, the prisoner might be sentenced &quot;as provided in subsection (C)&quot; i.e., for up to one year, with a limitation that the total time imposed &quot;for successive revocations&quot; i.e., all revocations, could not exceed the length of time of the prisoner's original sentence. Section 24-21-560(D) did not provide that the sentence for any successive revocation was limited to the amount of time remaining on the prisoner's original sentence, nor did the statute inevitably result in the &quot;doubling&quot; of a prisoner's sentence. Further, the only issue before the appellate court was the construction of the statute and not the wisdom of the CSP statutory scheme. Since defendant served three weeks on his prior revocation and his time for all revocations could not exceed six months, the trial judge properly sentenced defendant to five months and seven days of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a county, its treasurer, its auditor, and its assessor, appealed from an order entered by the Charleston County Circuit Court (South Carolina) certifying a class of taxpayers and ordering refunds for property taxes paid under Charleston, S.C., Ordinance 1163, which had been declared invalid. Respondent taxpayers cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county argued that the suit should have been dismissed, as the taxpayers failed to exhaust their administrative remedies under the South Carolina Revenue Procedures Act. The appellate court held that the taxpayers failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and that the suit should have been dismissed without prejudice. The taxpayers did not dispute any component of their property tax assessments, but argued that their tax bills were inflated as the consequence of the unlawful ordinance. However, the appellate court instructed the county to provide eligible taxpayers within the class with notice of their right to file an administrative refund action within 120 days. The appellate court strongly disapproved of the county's failure to refund the illegally collected taxes promptly and of its attempts to block the refund of those taxes. Further, the county's suggestion that a writ of mandamus be issued requiring the county to rebill all county taxpayers who benefited from the unlawful ordinance was described as audacious.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's orders were reversed. The case was remanded to the trial court with instructions to dismiss the suit without prejudice. The county was instructed to give written notice to the eligible taxpayers within the class of their right to seek an administrative refund, and of the date by which the refund request had to be initiated. Finally, the taxpayers were awarded their appellate costs and a reasonable attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner argued that the contract was unenforceable as a local referendum banned the video machines that formed the subject matter of the contract. The state's highest court noted that the parties were performing under the contract until performance became legally impossible because the subject matter of the contract became illegal and, as mandated by the local option law, the South Carolina Department of Revenue revoked the licenses required to legally possess and use the machines. Consequently, the parties' duties to perform under the contract were discharged and the parties were free to enter a new contract involving legal machines or seek other contractual relationships. The contract was not revived when the local option provision of the South Carolina Video Game Machines Act, former S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 12-21-2806 and -2808, was declared unconstitutional. The case presented a special circumstance in which the validity of transactions that occurred before the statute was declared unconstitutional had to be upheld. Neither party breached the contract. Thus, neither party was entitled to damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city brought an action challenging the incorporation of appellant town. The Charleston County, South Carolina, trial court found that S.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 5-1-30(A)(4) was enacted in response to lobbying by the town after the supreme court had ruled that marshlands and creeks had previously been annexed by other cities and therefore could not be used to establish the town's contiguity. Section 5-1-30(A)(4) provided that contiguity was not destroyed by an intervening marshland whether or not the marshland had been previously incorporated or annexed by another municipality. By establishing contiguity using marshland and waterways that had already been annexed by the city, the town was able to amass a population of 15,000, allowing it to bypass a request for annexation before incorporating. The supreme court held that the classification created by &sect; 5-1-30(A)(4) was arbitrary because there was no rational reason to allow only certain geographic areas to use territory belonging to a neighboring municipality to enable incorporation. Section &sect; 5-1-30(A)(4) created an unconstitutional diversity in municipal incorporation laws, which were constitutionally required to be uniform, by allowing only certain areas to incorporate using territory belonging to another municipality, and was therefore unconstitutional special legislation.</SPAN></P>

The daughters claims were based on the hospital's alleged failure to follow its adoption policies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother intended to place the daughter for adoption, but, in violation of hospital policy, the mother testified that she had no recollection of signing any documents concerning the adoption and that she was prevented from seeing the daughter after the birth. The daughter was reunited with her mother after her putative adopted parents were taken into custody for taking nude photos of her when she was eleven. The daughter subsequently brought the action against the hospital. Affirming the result, the court held that (1) the daughter's cause of action accrued at her birth in 1979 when the hospital allegedly failed to follow its adoption policies; (2) the court's declaration in 1992 that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 44-7-50 was unconstitutional meant the statute was unconstitutional from the date of its enactment in 1977 and thus void ab initio; (3) based on the law in effect in 1979, the daughter was required to prove the hospital's acts were reckless, not simply negligent, which she failed to do; (4) the failure to prove recklessness also defeated the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim; and (5) it was unnecessary to address the issues of duty or proximate cause.</SPAN></P>

The city denied the expansion of the sewer system to the developer's property. The developer challenged the validity of an ordinance on statutory and constitutional grounds. The supreme court found that (1) a justiciable controversy existed such that review of the developer's challenge to the facial validity of the ordinance was appropriate under the South Carolina Declaratory Judgments Act, S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 15-53-10 to 15-53-140 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2002); (2) the city properly exercised its legislative power to enact the challenged ordinance, and the ordinance was not contrary to statutory or constitutional provisions; and (3) the challenged ordinance did not violate the developer's constitutional rights to equal protection and substantive due process under the law.

It also reversed the trial court's order granting the city's summary judgment motion on her &sect; 1983 action against it.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dog owner bred dogs. A police officer who had issued some citations to her received another complaint about her dogs. He visited her house and saw 15 dogs. He left, but later returned. He saw five dogs running around the street and captured them. He later told the dog owner that he had taken the captured animals to the city's animal shelter. The city and the dog owner disputed whether she was informed she only had five days to claim the dogs; in any event, when they went unclaimed, they were euthanized. The dog owner filed a claim pursuant to &sect; 1983 against the city. The city sought summary judgment. The dog owner filed a motion to amend to add state law claims. The trial court granted the city's summary judgment on the claim and denied the motion to amend. The appellate court reversed the denial of the motion to amend and reversed the trial court's summary judgment grant to the city on the claim. The state supreme court granted certiorari and found that the dog owner should have been allowed to amend since her claims arose out of the timely-filed &sect; 1983 action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Greenville County Circuit Court (South Carolina) denied defendant's motion for a directed verdict, he was convicted of two counts of the sale of urine with the intent to defraud a drug or alcohol test, in violation of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-13-470 (2003). He appealed, arguing, inter alia, that &sect; 16-13-470 was unconstitutionally vague, the indictment was defective, and trial court erred in denying his directed verdict motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's business sold urine substitution kits that contained urine, a pouch, a tube, a hand-warmer device, duct tape, and instructions for use. The instructions advised how to use the heat pack to maintain proper temperature and how to affix the kit to the body for maximum concealment. The supreme court held that &sect; 16-13-470 was not unconstitutionally vague for failing to define the term &quot;drug test,&quot; as that term had a sufficiently common meaning to put one on notice of the conduct proscribed. Section 16-13-470 prohibited the sale with the intent to defraud any drug test, not merely tests for illegal drugs. That the indictment did not allege that defendant personally sold urine with the intent to defraud was not fatal. Defendant opened the door to cross-examination about pornographic links on his business's website, and was not prejudiced by this inquiry. In view of business cards enclosed with the kits that stated, &quot;Pass Any Drug Test,&quot; and the claim on defendant's website that the kits allowed anyone to pass any urinalysis, the evidence was sufficient to justify submission of the case to the jury; the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a directed verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Richland County Circuit Court (South Carolina) upheld the constitutionality of 1989 S.C. Acts 623 (Act 189). Appellant, a federal retiree, challenged the decision on behalf of a class of federal retirees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The federal retirees claimed that South Carolina discriminated in taxation between state and federal retirees in violation of the federal constitutional and statutory intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine. The issue on appeal was whether the circuit court erred in holding that Act 189 did not violate the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine codified in 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 111, and was therefore constitutional. The appellate court concluded that Act 189 was not, in effect, a tax rebate that implicated the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine. The power to compensate state retirees was clearly not delegated to the United States by the Constitution. As long as federal and state retirees were taxed equally, any restriction on this authority would violate U.S. Const. amend. X. Even if the elimination of the tax exemption for state retirees and the simultaneous increase in benefits were read together, the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity was not violated. South Carolina has specifically followed the remedy prescribed by Davis; therefore, the federal retirees' argument was unavailing.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 24-21-290 (Supp. 2002) modified only the third phrase, which related narrowly to disclosure, and did not modify the information's receipt as evidence in the trial court, which was specifically prohibited under the second phrase. By its terms, &sect; 24-21-290 made information given by a probationer to his probation agent inadmissible as evidence with no exception. A plain reading of the statute left no room for grafting onto it an exception to exclusion when the evidence was used for impeachment purposes. Whether the statement was voluntary or involuntary was irrelevant. Under &sect; 24-21-290, a probationer's statement to his probation agent was inadmissible for impeachment regardless of whether it was voluntarily or involuntarily given.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-36-2120(24) of the Act provided dry cleaners with a tax exemption for supplies and machinery used to perform their services. The Act imposed a sales tax on dry cleaners based on later-earned receipts. The supreme court held that this did not constitute a violation of equal protection. The taxpayer argued that the sales tax violated equal protection, because it was not imposed upon all service providers, only dry cleaners. The supreme court found that a class could be constitutionally confined to a particular trade, like dry cleaners. The taxpayer's claim failed, as it did not claim that the State taxed some dry cleaners differently from others. Furthermore, the State had a rational basis for treating dry cleaners differently from other service providers. The legislature achieved its goal of encouraging the establishment of dry cleaning business by exempting taxation on expensive startup costs in return for allowing the payment of sales taxes based on later-earned receipts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued the trial court erred by denying his motion to quash the indictment for contributing to the delinquency of a minor on the basis that the indictment was void for vagueness. He specifically claimed the phrase &quot;endanger the morals or health&quot; was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. The appellate court found that the phrase &quot;endanger the morals or health&quot; in the indictment derived directly from the language of the statute defendant was accused of violating, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-17-490(10) (2003). The indictment was sufficient. Defendant's act of encouraging a minor to drink beer and smoke marijuana, conduct which was illegal, clearly endangered the morals, if not the health, of the minor. Accordingly, defendant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-17-490(10) (2003). In any event, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. Three sentences in defendant's written statement to police did not constitute propensity evidence under S.C. R. Evid. 404(b). The sentences at issue did not refer to any &quot;crimes, wrongs, or acts.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The special purpose district was made up of a commission whose members were appointed by the governor. At relevant times, the special purpose district levied taxes on property within its service area. The county collected the taxes. The property owners paid taxes on their property in the service area of the special purpose district, but did not receive water or sewer service from the special purpose district. The trial court found that this was taxation without representation, which violated the Republican Guarantee Clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 4. Only the property owners' 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim remained. The appellate court ruled that U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 4 did not guarantee against taxation without representation. The United States Supreme Court refused to transmute the revolutionary slogan &quot;no taxation without representation&quot; into a constitutional principle and repeatedly rejected the proposition that the Federal Constitution guaranteed no taxation without representation. Because there was no independent, federal right found in U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 4 prohibiting taxation without representation, the property owners had no 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action.</SPAN></P>

A department employee never affirmatively represented that the settlement covered civil liability issues and criminal charges. On appeal, defendant asserted that S.C.

The state supreme court held that because the ordinance was enacted pursuant to the county's police powers under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 4-9-25 (Law. Co-Op.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant gave birth to a nearly full-term stillborn child. An autopsy showed a substance metabolized by cocaine in the infant. Defendant was convicted of homicide by child abuse and on her appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant was not entitled to a directed verdict because the State sufficiently demonstrated that the cocaine caused the stillbirth. Defendant's act of using cocaine, knowing that she was pregnant, was sufficient to go to the jury on whether she acted with extreme indifference. The legislature intended &sect; 16-3-85(A) to apply to the stillbirth of a fetus given the legislature's inaction after the court previously held that the term &quot;child&quot; included a viable fetus. Defendant had ample notice that her conduct was proscribed and therefore there was no due process violation. Defendant's use of cocaine while pregnant did not trigger a right to privacy. There was no Eighth Amendment violation because the gravity of the offense was severe, the penalty was proportionate to other murder offenses, and other states imposed similarly severe sentences. Defendant's urine test after the delivery was properly admitted because she voluntarily consented to the test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers brought a declaratory judgment action against defendant agencies, asserting the improper seizure of their income tax refunds. The taxpayers sought injunctive relief, return of seized refunds, and damages. In addition, they sought to be certified as class representatives. The Spartanburg County Circuit Court (South Carolina) granted summary judgment and issued a series of orders in favor of the taxpayers. The agencies appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This appeal concerned the Setoff Debt Collection Act, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-56-10 et seq., and the 1999 amendments thereto, 1999 S.C. Acts 1177, No. 1144. The trial court found that the notices sent by the claimant agencies did not adequately set out the review procedure, as contemplated by the 1995 provisions of the Act. The appellate court agreed. The instant case involved, in part, the years of 1996, 1997, and 1998. Therefore, the 1995 provisions were applicable. Despite the inadequate notice, the appellate court found that each taxpayer had to establish prejudice. Although the trial court did not specifically address the issue, it appeared that it improperly determined that violation of the notice provision constituted prejudice in and of itself. The taxpayers needed to establish that their debts were not due and owing, which they had not done. If there were a refund due, it would be from the agency that collected the setoff. The taxpayers did not show commonality, and the trial court erred by certifying both a plaintiff and defendant class. Each case had individual facts with regard to prejudice, which needed to be investigated, and which precluded a class action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The orders of the trial judge were affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers challenged the constitutionality of the Bingo Act of 1989, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-21-3310 et seq. (Supp. 1994), and two additional bingo statutes, S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 12-21-3441, 12-21-3610 (Supp. 1995) in an effort to recover taxes paid to respondent South Carolina Department of Revenue. The taxpayers appealed the decision of the Charleston County Circuit Court (South Carolina), which ruled in the Department's favor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the parties raised numerous constitutional issues. The state supreme court concluded that the plain meaning of S.C. Const. art. XVII, &sect; 7 was that bingo remained a lottery, but was a lottery that was not prohibited by the state constitution. The taxpayers' argument that they had a constitutional right to conduct bingo was flawed because bingo was a lottery and was gambling, and there was no right to gamble under the state constitution. In addition, the regulation of bingo had a legitimate state purpose (preventing the proliferation of crime), the regulations were rationally related to that purpose, and all charities that conducted bingo were treated alike. The taxpayers cited no authority for the proposition that conducting bingo was a fundamental right. The First Amendment challenge was not pleaded, discussed extensively at trial, or ruled upon by the trial judge; thus, it was not preserved for review. The taxpayers' argument that an implied exemption arose out of the State's historical tax treatment of charities was insufficient to show an implied exemption. Finally, the taxpayers' claims were not barred by res judicata.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1995, when defendant was 15 years old, he committed armed robbery. He was convicted as an adult of armed robbery and given a youthful offender sentence. Shortly after his release, defendant and two others broke into a mobile home, vandalized the residence, and stole cash, jewelry, and other items. The victim testified that her home was destroyed and that her animals were beaten and killed. Based upon defendant's most serious armed robbery conviction, the trial court sentenced him under the Two-Strikes Law. The appellate court found that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-25-45 did not violate the separation of powers doctrine by removing discretion from the judiciary, as the penalty assessed for a particular offense was, except in the rarest of cases, purely a matter of legislative prerogative. The sentence of life imprisonment without parole did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment despite defendant's age at the time he committed the armed robbery. Such a sentence did not offend evolving standards of decency, as a large number of states permitted severe punishments for youthful offenders.</SPAN></P>

With regard to defendant's argument that those committed under the Act were not treated as mentally ill persons, but as criminals, as those committed under the Act could be housed in ordinary jails and prisons, the supreme court advised that it previously held that housing sexually dangerous persons within a maximum-security prison did not transform the State's intent to treat into an intent to punish.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 39-5-10 et seq., and S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 32-1-10, 32-1-20.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The habitual gamblers argued that the video poker machine operators' payout offers and jackpot displays violated S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-21-2804(B) (repealed 2000) (Act). The appellate court had earlier held unconstitutional the part of the Act which banned advertising for playing video poker machines, but held that the Act's unconstitutional part was severable from the ban on specified payouts. For commercial speech to come within the First Amendment, it needed to concern lawful activity and not be misleading. Since, under the Act, certain payouts were illegal, the advertisement of such payouts was not protected speech. The Act was not unconstitutionally vague. Payouts in violation of the Act were prohibited under 27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 117-190.1. Lessors were banned from making or allowing to be made special inducements, even if they did not physically maintain or own the premises where the machines were located. Violations of the Act served as predicates in a RICO cause of action.  S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 32-1-10, -20 did not have any preclusive effect relating to SCUPTA and the video poker machine operators had no protection in the &quot;regulated activity&quot; exemption of SCUTPA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers were authorized to pick up a person who was alleged to be mentally ill. Three weeks later, he was driving a vehicle when he collided with the victims' vehicle causing their death. The administrators had alleged that the county and the sheriff's department were grossly negligent in failing to pick up the mentally ill person on the detention order. On appeal, the administrators argued, inter alia, that summary judgment was improperly granted to the county and sheriff's department on the basis of the public duty rule. The administrators further argued that the protected class was all persons traveling on the highways of the county. The supreme court held that such class was not found in the statutes but rather was the post hoc class created in light of the accident. Where the statutory duty was owed to the public as a whole, then the public duty rule barred the administrators from maintaining a negligence action against the governmental entity. Because the statutes created no special duty running to the administrators, the trial court properly granted the county and the sheriff's department summary judgment on the statutory duty claims.</SPAN></P>

When he was scheduled for release from prison, the State filed an action to have him designated a sexual predator, under the Sexually Violent Predator Act, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 44-48-10 et seq. (2000). A jury found him to be a sexually violent predator. He was committed for treatment, by order of the Georgetown County Circuit Court (South Carolina). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the Sexually Violent Predator Act (Act), S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 44-48-10 et seq. (2000), violated constitutional double jeopardy, ex post facto, and due process provisions. In rejecting this argument, the appellate court found that the Act was civil in nature, not criminal. The Act properly permitted confinement upon a determination that an offender currently suffered from both a mental abnormality or personality disorder and was likely to engage in acts of sexual violence.  S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 44-48-30(1) (2000). After commitment, defendant's custody was transferred from the department of mental health to the department of corrections. Although defendant argued that by being transferred he was subjected to conditions identical to those of prisoners, the appellate court found that there was no information in the record indicating that persons committed pursuant to the Act were being treated as if they were prisoners instead of as civilly committed persons. There was expert testimony that defendant suffered from two major mental illnesses: sadism and paraphilia, both sexual disorders. The evidence showed he was likely to engage in future acts of sexual violence.</SPAN></P>

The statutes represented a balanced approach, allowing a property owner to trap without a permit within 100 yards of her home, and there was no fee for a depredation permit. The statutes satisfied the rational basis test for equal protection purposes. The purpose of the statutes was to preserve wildlife, and they reasonably related to that goal. The statutes protected the furbearing animals in a reasonable manner, while also balancing a property owner's right to protect property from destruction. Members of the class were treated alike under similar circumstances. Finally, the classification based on the distance from the owner's home was rationally based. It was reasonable to allow a property owner to capture a damage-causing animal when it was close to the residence without first requiring the owner to secure a permit.</SPAN></P>

The aggravating factors alleged in the indictment were &quot;a difference in the sexes of the victim and the defendant&quot; and/or that &quot;the defendant did inflict serious bodily harm upon the victim by kicking her in the mid-section requiring her to seek medical attention.&quot; Defendant objected to the judge's charge on the aggravating circumstance of &quot;a difference of the sexes,&quot; contending it violated equal protection. The objection was overruled. Defendant was found guilty as charged. After judgment was entered, the state supreme court found the aggravating circumstance of a &quot;difference in the sexes&quot; did not violate defendant's equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue in the instant case involved the governor's re-direction of funds appropriated by the legislature. In his veto statement, the governor stated he was not vetoing supplemental appropriations to institutions of higher education because they agreed to return certain funds to the general fund. In the instant action, the governor argued it was impermissible for the attorney general (AG) to sue him, since he also represented him in other matters. In rejecting this argument, the highest court found that the AG had a dual role of being an attorney for the governor and an attorney for vindicating wrongs against the collective citizens of the state. Therefore, if the governor acted improperly the AG could sue him. The highest court found that the transfer of appropriated funds was for the legislative branch, not the executive branch. The concerted effort of the governor, comptroller, and treasurer, in transferring appropriated funds in the instant action, was improper. Finally, although the legislature was required to submit a balanced budget, there was no constitutional mandate for the governor, after exercising his veto power, to return a balanced budget to the legislature.</SPAN></P>

Defendant did not make any showing that the process of tattooing was communicative enough to automatically fall within First Amendment protection. Defendant did not rebut the presumption of validity by showing the statute was arbitrary and unreasonable, with no relation to a legitimate governmental interest. Defendant put forth no evidence other than his own testimony and the testimony of a licensed tattoo artist, regarding the safety or danger of tattooing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The main issue before the supreme court was whether the Act violated the ex post facto clause. The supreme court held that the Act met the first prong of determining whether it fell within ex post facto prohibitions; that is, the Act was retroactive because it applied to events which occurred before its enactment. In particular, it applied to defendant, whose offense was committed in 1973, prior to the enactment of the Act. Since it was clear that the general assembly did not intend to punish sex offenders, but instead intended to protect the public from those sex offenders who might re-offend and to aid law enforcement in solving sex crimes, the language indicated the intention to create a non-punitive law. The Act was not so punitive in purpose or effect as to constitute a criminal penalty. Thus, the Act did not violate the ex post facto clauses of the state or federal Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court issued a writ of mandamus ordering the department to process the delegation's funding approval. The department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-28-2730 (Supp. 2000) provided for the funding of the W.R.R.F. The department oversaw the allocation of funds from the W.R.R.F. The delegation forwarded its approval to the department to disperse W.R.R.F. funds to constituent organizations. The department informed the delegation that it would not process the request until it ascertained what W.R.R.F. funds it would use to comply with provisos in the South Carolina 2001-2002 Appropriations Act. The delegation then sought to compel the department to disperse the funds as it had approved. On appeal, the supreme court found that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-28-2730&nbsp;unconstitutionally usurped executive powers for the benefit of legislative delegations, because the South Carolina Legislature was constitutionally forbidden from undertaking to pass laws and then to execute them by bestowing upon its own members powers belonging to the executive branch. Further, &sect; 12-28-2730 could not survive the severing of the unconstitutional requirement of legislative delegation approval.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Horry County Circuit Court, South Carolina, granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, city and water authority, in appellant customers' action challenging the city's 1996 ordinance raising water rates for all nonresident customers. The customers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customers argued that the trial court erred. Under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 5-31-1910 (1976), the city's contract for its allocated capacity in the plant was sufficient ownership to pass muster. The ownership requirement of the statute simply ensured a municipality's ability to provide water to the persons with whom it contracts. The city owned an allocated capacity of water produced. It had a proprietary interest in the capacity as evidenced by its unilateral ability to sell or lease it.  S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 5-31-670 did not expressly apply to nonresident municipal water customers. There was no reasonable rate requirement for water service to nonresidents. The customers were charged the same rates as all other out-of-city customers and the city therefore met its contractual obligation to charge reasonable rates. The city thus breached no fiduciary duty. Even if the customers qualified as third-party beneficiaries of an earlier federal court order, they were deprived of no benefit bestowed by that order. The contractual provision requiring annexation was valid as a means of broadening the city's tax base.</SPAN></P>

The entrepreneurs argued the trial judge should have evaluated their takings claim under standard takings analysis rather than simply ruling that highly regulated industries were precluded from establishing a takings claim. The supreme court disagreed because the entrepreneurs' rights to cash payouts were dependent upon regulatory licensing and not inherent in the right to own or possess gaming machines. The entrepreneurs argued the trial judge erred by dismissing their contract clause claim. The supreme court disagreed and held that the trial judge properly dismissed the contract clause claim because the entrepreneurs could not have reasonably expected cash payouts for coin-operated video gaming machines to remain legal when they entered into the contracts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school district sued respondents, city and county, challenging their right to allocate certain revenue received in lieu of taxes. The Horry County Circuit Court (South Carolina) granted summary judgment to the city and county. The district appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county initiated creation of a multi-county business park (MCBP) partially within the limits of the city. The school district was coterminous with the county, and the city was located entirely within the county and the school district. Property within the MCBP was constitutionally exempt from ad valorem taxation, but the owners had to pay an amount equal to the taxes otherwise payable, fees in lieu of taxes. The agreement creating the MCBP at issue allocated revenue from MCBP in a lower proportion than the district would have received had the MCBP not been tax exempt. The district argued that S.C. Code &sect;&sect; 4-1-170, -175, should not have been construed to allow the result. The appellate court, though finding flaws in these statutes, agreed with the trial court's interpretation, and that the statutes as interpreted were constitutional. Reading &sect;&sect; 4-1-170 and -175 together, there was no requirement that revenues from the fees in lieu of taxes from an MCBP be distributed in the same proportion that it would be if the property were taxable. Further, the MCBP statutes were consistent with the Education Finance Act, S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 59-20-10 through -80 (1990 &amp; Supp. 2000).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the supreme court found that the trial record, post-conviction relief transcript, affidavits, and depositions supported the trial court's finding that defendant did not knowingly and intelligently waive his statutory right to make a personal closing statement during the guilt phase of his capital murder trial. However, it also found that the trial court erred in granting defendant a new trial because defendant did not show he was prejudiced by the lack of waiver. The fact that defendant appeared before the jury during the guilt phase, even if his appearance was not during the closing statement, demonstrated due process and fundamental fairness were not offended by the error. Considering the evidence of guilt and malice, defendant's testimony, and his attorney's closing argument, there was no reasonable possibility defendant's failure to make a personal closing argument to the jury during the guilt phase of his trial contributed in any way to his convictions. Because there was no reasonable probability that but for counsel's deficient performance, the result of defendant's trial would have been different, defendant suffered no prejudice.</SPAN></P>

A reading of the arrest warrant affidavit raised a question regarding the legality of the weapons frisk of defendant, but defendant could not rely upon this document alone to establish his ineffective assistance claim. Defendant also had to show prejudice, that had his trial attorney challenged the frisk, there was reasonable probability that she would have prevailed in a suppression hearing. Assuming that trial counsel's failure to investigate the circumstances surrounding the search fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, defendant did not meet his burden of showing resulting prejudice. Defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily agreed to plead guilty to both offenses as part of a plea bargain in which the State agreed to drop three other drug charges.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendant's motions, while assuring defense counsel defendant was &quot;protected&quot; on the record, and accepted defendant's guilty plea. The trial court erred in accepting a conditional guilty plea from defendant. Such a plea could only be unconditional, and when defendant attempted to attach the condition that she would be allowed to raise her constitutional arguments on appeal, the trial court was required to direct a plea of not guilty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the supreme court found that the patient failed to meet his burden of proof showing the Sexually Violent Predator Act, S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 44-48-10 to -170 (Supp. 2000), on its face was punitive rather than civil in nature. It also found that any alleged unconstitutional confinement would be by writ of habeas corpus; however, since he had been released by the department of mental health, the claim was moot. The supreme court also ruled that there was no error in the general charge, which gave the jury the background of the issue they were being asked to decide, followed by a charge defining the terms which the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. In the recharge, the trial judge did not improperly emphasize any one part of the statute at the expense of another; he simply charged the statute, and where a specific term had a specific definition, charged that definition. Because the supreme court determined that the patient failed to show that his was a criminal proceeding, his effective assistance of counsel claims failed. Further, he failed to show any prejudice, much less a constitutional violation, in the denial of funds to depose unidentified individuals.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court agreed that the temporary injunction issue was moot but decided to address the merits of the case. It found that &sect; 16-13-470&nbsp;unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof on the issue of criminal intent to the defendant and that the unconstitutional intent language was severable from the remainder of the section. The supreme court also ruled that &sect; 16-13-470 was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad, that it served a legitimate public purpose of creating safety in the workplace, and that it did not prohibit the business owner from dispensing literature regarding his political beliefs on urine testing. The business owner's equal protection claims failed because all individuals who engaged in conduct prohibited by &sect; 16-13-470 were treated alike, regardless of whether they adulterated urine samples with herbal supplements or chemicals.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a hurricane damaged homeowners' pier, they sought a permit to rebuild it. The city eventually issued a permit. Homeowners alleged the loss of use of their property during the years until a permit was issued was an inverse condemnation, entitling them to compensation. During this interim, city passed an ordinance conditioning a permit to rebuild a pier on making the pier publicly accessible, to which homeowners objected. City never enforced the ordinance against homeowners, so it did not create a temporary taking without compensation. The city's initial denial of homeowners' permit application, based on provisions of its zoning ordinance, ultimately reversed by the court of appeals, was not a temporary taking, as homeowners never claimed the ordinance's preclusion of the reestablishment of a legal nonconforming use under certain circumstances was unconstitutional in that it either failed to advance a legitimate governmental interest or denied all economically viable use of the property as a whole. No temporary taking occurred during homeowners' appeal of the city's adverse zoning ruling. Regulatory delay did not create a temporary taking.</SPAN></P>

Respondent filed a summons and complaint in the trial court, asserting appellant did not have jurisdiction over respondent. The trial court held a hearing and found appellant had jurisdiction over the BCD, but not over respondent's conduct.

He was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-25-45 (Supp. 2000), commonly known as the Two-Strikes law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The three victims were robbed at gunpoint by an unknown assailant. Three weeks after the robbery, police showed each victim, independently, a photographic line-up of six individuals; all three victims identified appellant as the person who robbed them. Appellant was later convicted of three counts of armed robbery and possession of a firearm and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. On appeal, appellant contended the three counts of armed robbery should have been rolled into a single count, as the goods were taken from three victims simultaneously. The court held that because there was a threat of bodily injury to each victim from whom property was stolen, appellant could be charged with separate offenses. The court also found no constitutional violation in application of the state's Two-Strikes law to appellant. The sentence appellant received pursuant to the law was proportionate to the sentences imposed on other criminals in South Carolina and on criminals in other jurisdictions for the same offense. There was absolutely nothing in the record supporting appellant's assertion that minorities were affected most by the Two-Strikes law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed; appellant was properly charged with three separate counts of armed robbery, as though property was taken from the three victims simultaneously, there was a threat of bodily injury to each victim from whom property was stolen. Further, the Two-Strikes law did not violate the state constitution as applied to appellant, as life sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

Acts 3131, 3134, the Charleston County School District's Board of Trustees (school board) certified to defendant, the county auditor, a tax levy of approximately 99 4/10 (99.4) mills for school district operations. Defendant indicated that she would not levee more than 90 mills without a directive from the instant court. Plaintiffs then filed the instant action asking the court to direct defendant to levy the taxes as certified by the school board. The court concluded: (1) the Charleston County Legislative Delegation was not an indispensable party; (2) the plain language of &sect; 11 was direct and mandatory and required defendant to levy the taxes once the school board had duly complied with the other portions of the act; and (3) nothing in the plain language of &sect; 11 required the legislative delegation's approval before the millage rate could be increased.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant was charged with first-degree murder. His vehicle was pulled over for speeding. A shot was fired, killing the arresting trooper. In custody, appellant spoke with law enforcement officers after being informed of and waiving his Miranda rights; he told the officers that his passenger had shot the trooper. Later, appellant said he wanted to talk further. He implicated himself. The trial court gave a jury instruction on witnesses' credibility which stated the jurors' objective was to seek the truth. Appellant was convicted and sentenced to death. He appealed. The court affirmed. The court held the instruction was not a violation of appellant's due process rights as it did not shift the burden of proof or dilute the reasonable doubt standard. The court also ruled appellant's confession was voluntarily given, the court did not err in refusing appellant the right to cross-examine a witness regarding dismissed narcotics charges having no bearing on truthfulness, and no error occurred in not redacting part of appellant's statement about a contract on his life. Finally, the court held the sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

Acts 189, which affected state retirees' tax benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff federal retirees, as a class, sought a declaratory judgment on the constitutionality of 1989 S.C. Acts 189, which abolished state retirees' income tax exemption (to comply with federal law) and simultaneously increased their pension benefits, while doing nothing for federal retirees. Although parties challenging state taxes were normally required to pursue their administrative remedies in compliance with the South Carolina Revenues Procedures Act, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-60-10 et seq., the exhaustion rule was not jurisdictional, and it would not be applied to compel plaintiffs to engage in a futile act. Since only a court could determine the constitutionality of a statute, pursuit of an administrative appeal would have been futile. Therefore plaintiffs were entitled to have their action heard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded. Exhaustion of remedies did not apply to an action to determine whether a statute was constitutional, because the administrative process would not provide an answer to that issue.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 15-67-270 was constitutional. Section 15-67-270 did not authorize a taking of private property because the temporary license allowed respondent to enter appellants' property only for a temporary period after fully compensating appellants, and because appellants did not lose all economic value of the property because they were still able to use their home despite the license. Section 15-67-270 was a valid exercise of the state's police powers to preserve property.

The DOR failed to show the ban would promote its goal of decreasing gambling activity. The court held the statute did not meet the last two prongs in the Central Hudson test--the regulation did not advance the governmental interest asserted, and was more extensive than was necessary to serve that interest, thus the statute was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city declared its downtown, a slum area, an empowerment zone and designated it as a redevelopment project area eligible for federally tax-exempt local government bonds to finance business enterprises under 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1391 et seq. Appellant partnership, which was not eligible for government-sponsored financing and would be in competition for respondent developer's tenants and patrons, asserted respondent loan program did not serve a public purpose as required by the state constitution. The court affirmed the opinion of the lower court, holding that the determination of public purpose was one for the legislative branch and that legislation was not for a private purpose merely because some individual made a profit as a result of the enactment. Elimination of decaying and unhealthy areas within a city directly benefited the public, although private parties within the area might also benefit incidentally.

Act No. 125, which made possession of the machines illegal as of July 1, 2000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs contended enforcement of 1999 S.C. Act No. 125 (Act) should have been enjoined because it effected a taking of their video gaming machines without compensation. The machines at issue provided for nonmachine cash payouts; prior to the legislation at issue, the machines were legal. The Act would have amended S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-21-2710 (2000) to remove the exemption for video gaming machines, thereby rendering the possession or operation of the machines illegal. Further, under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-21-2712 (2000), the machines would have then been subject to forfeiture and destruction by the state. Under its original jurisdiction, the court denied the injunction, finding that plaintiffs were entitled to no compensation because their machines were lawfully subject to forfeiture as contraband. During the eight months between enactment of the law and its enforceability, plaintiffs had a reasonable period of time to avoid any forfeiture of their property and could not have claimed a compensable taking. Further, there was no taking of plaintiffs' businesses or their real property under either the federal or state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Injunction denied.

There was no taking of either plaintiffs' businesses or real property under either federal or state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, adult businesses, sought review of a judgment from the Greenville County Court, South Carolina, holding that Greenville Co., S. C., Zoning Ordinance No. 2673, licensing and controlling the location of appellants' businesses, was constitutional. Appellants urged that the ordinance was an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech and that it impermissibly zoned them out of the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed a judgment finding Greenville Co., S. C., Zoning Ordinance No. 2673 constitutional and held it to be an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech. The ordinance required appellants, sexually oriented businesses, to obtain a permit from the county zoning administrator in order to operate and controlled where they could locate. Businesses providing non-obscene, sexually explicit material were entitled to protection by the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and I. Applying a two-prong test, the court affirmed the lower court's finding that the licensing decision under the ordinance was made within a reasonable time, and the restriction on location was valid. Construing the ordinance as a whole, the contention that not enough property was available for relocation was unsupported. Furthermore, the trial court's finding that nine relocation sites existed was reasonable and thus could not be disturbed. Nevertheless, the requirement for prompt judicial review of adverse licensing decisions was lacking. There was no guarantee that a judicial determination, meaning a judicial denial of a license, would be rendered within a prescribed period of time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed a judgment holding that an ordinance which licensed and restricted the location of appellants, adult businesses, was constitutional. The challenged ordinance failed to provide for prompt judicial review of adverse licensing decisions. A constitutionally proper scheme required that the licensor make the decision within a reasonable time and that prompt judicial review was available.</SPAN></P>

There were two issues on review: (1) did the post-conviction relief court err in summarily dismissing petitioner's claim, and (2) did the change from annual parole review to biannual review violate the Ex Post Facto Clause? As to the first issue, the court held that, as a non-collateral matter, petitioner's ex post facto claim should be remanded to the appropriate agency to allow it to make a final decision on petitioner's claim. As to the second issue, the court agreed that the change in petitioner's parole review to a biannual review constituted an ex post facto violation. The court found that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 24-21-645 offended S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 4, even if the federal constitution was not offended.

Two magistrates found the machines to be illegal contraband under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-21-2710 (Supp. 1998) and ordered them destroyed. The circuit court affirmed both destruction orders. On appeal, appellant argued that possession of the machines was not unlawful because the federal Gambling Devices Transportation Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1172(a) (1997), preempts the state law, and because the machines must be operational to violate the law. The court affirmed the circuit court's affirmation of the magistrate's destruction orders.

Subsequent to his conviction, appellant argued that admission of the prior crimes was highly prejudicial and deprived him of due process because it diluted respondent's burden of proof as to other statutory elements. The court disagreed, holding that respondent was required to prove all elements of the statute despite its ability to offer evidence of prior convictions. Additionally, the court held that the probative value of admitting the prior convictions outweighed its prejudicial effect, due to analogous U.S. Supreme Court case law allowing admission of other crimes to establish a material element of the offense charged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed because allowing respondent to introduce evidence of appellant's prior burglary convictions did not dilute respondent's burden of proving the remaining elements under the burglary statute.</SPAN></P>

HOLDINGS: [1]-The county sheriff's office deputies were to be considered de facto deputies, despite the lack of compliance with the requirements of S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 23-13-10 and 23-13-20 (2007), because all of the deputies who participated in defendant's capture and arrest had been employed with the sheriff's office for a significant number of years and stated that they were bonded and had taken an oath for every sheriff for whom they had worked. Moreover, at the time of defendant's capture and arrest, the deputies were performing duties consistent with their appointments as deputies and were identifiable to defendant as deputy sheriffs who had authority.</SPAN></P>
