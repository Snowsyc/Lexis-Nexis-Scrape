</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that her underlying upward departure sentence should have been vacated, as the court previously held that the Kansas scheme for imposing upward departure sentences was unconstitutional on its face and any sentence imposed thereunder was void. State argued that the prior court ruling did not apply to void defendant's sentence, as she pled guilty to her crimes, thus waiving her right to a jury trial, and consequently, her right to have a jury determine beyond a reasonable doubt any aggravating factors supporting her departure sentence. The court ruled that it did need not reach State's arguments because Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4716 (2000 Supp.), relating to imposing upward departure sentences, was declared unconstitutional on its face. Furthermore, by pleading guilty to felony theft, defendant did not admit she was not amenable to probation, nor did she admit any other fact that might have supported an upward departure sentence. The court determined that State simply failed to present a valid reason for retreating from the courts prior holding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendant was convicted of premeditated first-degree murder in the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas). The defendant appealed his conviction claiming: (1) the evidence was insufficient to conclude that the victim died as a result of the shooting; (2) his right to confrontation was violated by admitting audiotapes into evidence without playing them before the jury; and (3) other evidentiary issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendant, a gang member, shot the victim, a two-year-old girl, in the head. After being taken to the hospital, she was taken off life support systems and died. The defendant argued that as the State failed to put on evidence that the victim was brain dead, the court had to find as a matter of law that the cause of death was the withdrawal of life support. The appellate court held that sufficient evidence existed that the defendant's gunshot killed the victim as the State introduced the autopsy report and expert witness testimony that the victim died of a gunshot wound. The defendant could not use the withdrawal of life support as a defense when he had inflicted a mortal wound. It was not error to admit videotapes into evidence without playing them in open court, as the defense counsel stipulated to their foundation and declined the court's offers to play the tapes in open court. The photographs of the victim were not prejudicial, as they were relevant to the State's case in proving the cause of death. The admission of gang association was not erroneous where the defense failed to request a limiting instruction. The defendant's other grounds for appeal also failed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and another man were separately tried for committing a double murder. Defendant claimed the other man was the murderer, though he admitted to being present. There was sufficient evidence to support the premeditation finding. A jury could have inferred that the two men knew the house was occupied and that the killings were done without provocation. The State's peremptory challenge withstood Batson scrutiny. Adoptive admission was properly admitted under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-460(h)(2) (Supp. 2000). Photographs showing the number of wounds and weapons used were relevant to the issue of premeditation. The upward durational departures on his aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, and theft convictions were vacated and the issue remanded because, subsequent to defendant filing his brief, Kansas' scheme for imposing upward departure sentences, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4716 (Supp. 2000), was found to be in violation of constitutional due process and jury trial rights. The hard 40 sentence was properly entered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Dickinson (Kansas) District Court of capital murder, aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, and two counts of theft.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant raised numerous issues regarding his convictions and sentence. The supreme court held that (1) a motion to change venue was properly denied, as none of the selected jurors had any familiarity with the victims, and there was not sufficient publicity to establish prejudice, nor was any false information published; (2) defendant failed to show, through his statistics on 110 of the more suspect prospective jurors, that a real problem concerning racial prejudice existed in the county different from any other counties; (3) the evidence, including testimony that both victims were shot after they were incapacitated, was sufficient to support a finding of premeditation; (4) the prosecutor's comments about defendant's failure to produce other witnesses to corroborate his story was not reversible error; (5) photographs of the crime scene, though gruesome, were not unduly repetitious, and were relevant to the issue of premeditation; and (6) the hard 40 sentence was properly imposed. However, the upward durational departure sentences for the robbery, burglary, and theft convictions were improper in light of the court's recent decision in State v. Gould.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the convictions, but vacated the sentences in part, and remanded with directions. The State's cross-appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

Then the prosecution stated in closing argument that premeditation could happen in a second. Defendant failed to object.

The Sedgwick District Court, Kansas, granted partial summary judgment against the school district and the coach holding that the recreational use exception, Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The son was a 12th grade high school student who collapsed on the practice field after participating in a mandatory football practice.

The supreme court found that on remand the grandmother and great-grandparents had the burden of proving that visitation was in the child's best interest and that a substantial relationship with the grandchildren existed. In addition, the supreme court strictly construed Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1616(b) (Supp. 2000) and Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bank had a policy providing that it would not release any information about customer accounts pursuant to a subpoena without notifying the customer and argued that the secrecy requirements under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3012 supported its refusal. Moreover, the bank argued that the word &quot;private&quot; in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17-1265(a)(1) likewise limited the Commissioner's authority to investigate their customers' personal banking information. The Kansas Supreme Court stated that under the doctrine of operative construction, the purpose and legislative intent of &sect; 17-1265(a)(1) was to allow for governmental regulation of speculative securities to prevent fraud. Thus, the Commissioner rationally interpreted &sect; 17-1265(a)(1) to allow for private investigations in regard to securities registrations, although the words &quot;secret&quot; and &quot;private&quot; in the respective statutes were synonymous. Further, the supreme court had previously held that Kansas citizens had no constitutional right to privacy in their bank records. Therefore, the Commissioner had the authority to issue a subpoena to examine customer records and to prohibit the bank from informing its customers of the subpoenas.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court answered yes. The scheme for imposing upward departures embodied in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4716 (Supp. 2001) was previously ruled unconstitutional on its face when the scheme violated the due process and jury trial rights contained in the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The upward departure decision in the instant matter was based on Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4716(b)(2)(F) (Supp. 2001), a product of that unconstitutional scheme.</SPAN></P>

A verdict was entered in the Shawnee District Court, Kansas, partially in the troopers' favor. However, the troopers were denied relief under the Kansas Whistleblower Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-2973, and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The four troopers were employees of the highway patrol.

Eventually, the troopers were told that their jobs were being eliminated. After eight years of litigation, the troopers and the State and highway patrol appealed. The supreme court held inter alia: (1) the Kansas Whistleblower Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-2973, as applied to classified state employees with permanent status, provided the troopers with an adequate exclusive remedy for claimed retaliation for whistleblowing and no common-law remedy existed that they were entitled to pursue; and (2) while the State of Kansas was a person for the purposes of &sect; 1983 actions wherein injunctive relief was sought, the State did not waive its sovereign immunity from suits seeking damages under that section.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3717(f) (Supp. 1993) unconstitutionally conditioned the conversion of a parolee sentence, and violated his equal protection rights. The supreme court held that defendant's rights were not violated by &sect; 22-3717(f) because: (1) the constitutional right involved was defendant's liberty; (2) the benefit offered was conversion of his indeterminate aggravated burglary sentence; (3) the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions did not apply; (4) the status of defendant's aggravated battery sentence was not a fundamental interest, so the court applied the rational basis review; and (5) both of defendant's technical parole violations occurred after the nine-month window created by the language in &sect; 22-3717(f).</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court granted claimant's petition for review of the court of appeals' opinion, which reversed the decision of the Workers Compensation Board. The court of appeals found that simultaneous injuries to claimant's right arm and right leg were compensable as two separate scheduled injuries under Kan. Stat.

The question for review was whether claimant's injuries were compensable as two scheduled injuries or as a whole body disability. On review, the court affirmed. Under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-510d(a)(19), the statutory scheme was not designed to provide compensation for two of any one body part. While Kan. Stat.

The court found that the defendant committed his crime prior to the effective date of the amendments to &sect; 21-4603d(e) and the defendant was sentenced in a grid block not encompassed by the prior version of the statute. The court held that the statute prescribed the punishment for a criminal act, therefore the statute was substantive and could not be applied retroactively.

On the murder conviction, the trial court imposed a life sentence without possibility of parole for 40 years. Appellant also was convicted of three counts of aggravated assault on bystanders for which the trial court imposed a prison sentence of 13 months consecutive to the hard 40 sentence. On appeal, he challenged his being prosecuted as an adult and claimed error in the trial court's imposing the hard 40 sentence. The state supreme court determined that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-1636 granted the district attorney the discretion to request that appellant be tried as an adult. However, the hard 40 sentence was vacated. With respect to the sentencing, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4636 provided that aggravating circumstances were limited to those specified by the legislature. The trial court's consideration of two nonstatutory circumstances was improper.</SPAN></P>

Appellees filed an action against appellant seeking to recover money illegally exacted as liquor license fees. The Sedgwick District Court, Kansas, certified the class, denied appellant's motions for summary judgment, and granted appellees' cross-motion for summary judgment. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees were required to obtain a liquor license from appellant and pay a license fee in order to do business. Appellant exempted itself from the fee limitations in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-2622, and set fees exceeding the statutory maximums. Appellees sought refunds of fees paid in excess of the statutory maximums from July 1988 until November 1995. The supreme court found that: (1) The Club and Drinking Establishment Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-2601 et seq., was uniformly applicable for the purpose of home rule analysis; (2) appellees' payment of the license fees was involuntary, and they were entitled to refunds of overpayments; (3) the applicable statute of limitations was found in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-512, and the statute began to run from the date of payment of the fees; (4) Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that &sect; 21-3516 was facially overbroad in violation of the First Amendment because it criminalized &quot;exhibition in the nude&quot; of children under age 16 and had no scienter requirement. The instant court held that &sect; 21-3516 was not unconstitutionally overbroad. The statute's wording clearly criminalized the possession of child pornography. The words &quot;exhibition in the nude&quot; did not make the statute unconstitutionally broad under any reasonable and sensible interpretation. The instant court did not review defendant's scienter argument because it was not raised in the trial court below. Regarding the denial of defendant's motion to suppress his statements to federal agents, defendant failed to properly preserve this issue because of his failure to object to the evidence at trial. The manner of jury selection did not result in a constitutional violation or require that a new trial be granted. A review of the evidence showed it was sufficient to prove all of the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the instant court also concluded that the doubling of defendant's sentence to 256 months was erroneously accomplished.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that her convictions had to be reversed due to insufficient evidence, prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments, and error by the trial court in failing to instruct the jury regarding multiple counts and aggravated battery. Defendant also argued that the statute authorizing imposition of her upward departure sentence was unconstitutional. The instant court rejected defendant's claims challenging her convictions. A rational factfinder could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of abusing her children. The prosecutor's remarks, although improper, had little, if any, likelihood of changing the result of the trial. The remarks were not so gross and flagrant as to prejudice defendant and deny her a fair trial. The trial court's failure to instruct the jury on aggravated battery was not clearly erroneous, as there was no real possibility that the jury would have reached a different decision had the instruction been given. However, the instant court concluded that defendant's sentence was imposed pursuant to an unconstitutional sentencing scheme and could not stand, and it declined to apply principles of harmless error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions were affirmed, but defendant's upward departure sentence was vacated, and the case was remanded for imposition of a sentence not to exceed the statutory maximum applicable to the facts as found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State brought a quo warranto action to oust appellant, a county sheriff, from office. The trial court entered an order of ouster from office, finding by clear and convincing evidence that appellant committed willful misconduct under Kan. Stat.

The supreme court affirmed, holding that (1) U.S. Const. amend. V did not mandate a stay of the proceedings while criminal perjury charges were pending against appellant; (2) discussions between the assistant district attorney and appellant were not protected by the attorney-client privilege, because there was no attorney-client relationship between the two; (3) the attorney general's office was not disqualified from representing the State in the case; and (4) the use of a two-judge advisory jury in the trial court was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant purchaser obtained appellees' real estate through a tax foreclosure auction conducted by appellant county. Appellants disputed the trial court's refusal to confirm the sale due to insufficient notice given to appellees. Service by publication, without more, was unconstitutionally invalid. Appellees' due process rights were protected by what occurred prior to and in addition to the attempted publication service. All attempts at service by mail were unsuccessful. Thus, the issue was whether the county knew the address to which proper service could have been made or whether the county could have reasonably ascertained a correct address. There was no question that the county did not have a correct current address. Thus, the inquiry was whether the county could have reasonably ascertained a proper address. While appellees had some duty to keep the county informed of their address and to pay property tax, the efforts taken by the county to locate appellees should have been proportional to the use and value of the property. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding that the county failed in its lackluster efforts to locate appellees for personal service.</SPAN></P>

Though the experts and prosecution emphasized the lack of a veterinary-client-patient relationship, there was other evidence to support the inference that appellant dispensed the Winstrol-V in bad faith. There was no abuse of discretion in the admission of expert testimony. The question of whether appellant had a legitimate medical purpose in dispensing Winstrol-V was a question of fact for the jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff appealed the judgment of the Shawnee district court (Kansas) granting defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Kansas Department of Revenue (Department) employed plaintiff as an attorney, a classified civil service position. In 1996, plaintiff created controversy within the Department in response to public criticism of the Department's actions by first delivering a memo to his supervisor and then sending a letter to the Governor, in which he disclosed confidential information. Eventually, plaintiff was terminated and filed suit. Plaintiff appealed after his suit was dismissed for failure to state a claim. Plaintiff's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;1983 claim seeking only declaratory and injunctive relief was not subject to dismissal, as a state official in his official capacity, when sued for injunctive relief, would be a person under &sect;1983 because official-capacity actions for prospective relief are not treated as actions against the State. Further, plaintiff was not required to exhaust administrative remedies prior to bringing his &sect;1983 action, regardless of whether he brought suit in state or federal court. Official-capacity suits against state officials that seek only injunctive relief were permitted by &sect;1983, and not forbidden by U.S. Const. amend. XI exceptions to sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff's &sect; 1983 claim for injunctive relief against the Department and its Secretary in her official capacity for failure to exhaust administrative remedies was erroneously dismissed by the trial court and that ruling was reversed. However, the trial court did correctly dismiss the plaintiff's &sect; 1983 action for injunctive relief against the Department, although not for the reasons on which it relied.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction from the Sumner County District Court (Kansas), claiming that the stop and Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-2108 violated the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the random stop of his commercial vehicle and contended that there was insufficient evidence that he was notified of his status as a habitual violator. Defendant only contested whether Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-2108(b) was constitutionally limited in time, place, and manner. Applying United State Supreme Court analysis, the court held that the statute was and remained constitutional. It was reasonable not to limit when a commercial vehicle could be stopped since commercial trucking occurred 24 hours a day. Motor carriers were on notice that such stops could occur, limited to determining compliance with applicable motor carrier laws. The place involved was the highways and traffickways of the state of Kansas. There was a sufficient public interest in safety to justify the place. In rejecting his other argument, the court determined that the evidence of notification of his habitual violator status and mailing was sufficient to convict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Conviction was affirmed because statute authorizing random stops of commercial vehicles for inspection was constitutionally limited in time, place, and manner, and the evidence of notification and mailing of his habitual violator status was sufficient to convict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Three defendants were charged with driving under the influence (DUI). At the time of the arrests, the policy at the county jail was to hold DUI arrestees for 12 hours. In accordance with the policy, each defendant was confined at least 12 hours. In each case an order was issued removing the matter from the magistrate judge to the district court. The district court dismissed the cases against two of the defendants on the ground that the established policy, which required DUI offenders to serve 12 hours' mandatory jail time before being allowed to post bond, violated constitutional guarantees of due process and against double jeopardy. The trial judge referred to his own ruling in an earlier DUI case. The district court dismissed the DUI charges. Plaintiff State appealed. The appellate court reversed. The district court believed that the officers disregarded its ruling made in a previous case. However, the decision by the district judge in the prior case was made after the defendants herein were arrested. Thus, the officers did not disregard a previous ruling or decision by the district court in detaining the defendants, and the dismissals were not warranted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dismissal was reversed and remanded, since the lower court incorrectly determined that police had disregarded an earlier court order by automatically detaining the defendants for DUI offenses.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs sued defendant hospital and defendant doctor. Plaintiffs settled their claims against the hospital. The action against defendant doctor proceeded to trial, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of the parents. Because the parents already had received the statutory limit on wrongful death damages as settlement proceeds from the hospital, the trial court entered no judgment against defendant doctor for wrongful death damages. Plaintiffs appealed from that judgment. Defendant doctor cross-appealed on liability issues. The appellate court held that the trial court erred in not granting the plaintiffs a judgment of $ 100,000 (the statutory cap amount) for their wrongful death claim since the settlement with defendant hospital had no effect on plaintiffs' right of recovery against defendant doctor. Defendant doctor's claim on cross-appeal that plaintiffs' counsel's arguments were improper would not be considered because the transcript of the closing argument was not complete.</SPAN></P>

The intermediate court found that appellant had prevented a substantial relationship from developing between the appellees and the grandchild and created an exception to the rule that the burden was on appellees to show that visitation was in the best interests of the grandchild. Appellant sought review, and the court reversed. The exception violated appellant's due process rights, and did not give any weight to the presumption that, as a fit parent, appellant would have acted in the best interests of her child.</SPAN></P>

The judge only had jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of &sect; 21-4603d(e) if that statute applied to appellant. At the time of appellant's sentencing the prior version of the statute was applied by the sentencing court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appeal his conviction of stalking his wife, alleging, inter alia, that the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) improperly denied his motions for mistrial and a new trial, that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3438 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and that the record does not support its upward departure from the sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After over a decade of domestic abuse and violent encounters, all of the past police reports were compiled and the district attorney filed charges against defendant for stalking the victim, defendant's wife. A jury convicted defendant of one count of stalking in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3438 and the trial court, departing from the presumptive sentence, sentenced defendant to 60 months of probation. Rejecting defendant's argument that the stalking statute was unconstitutional, the appellate court affirmed the conviction, holding that the statute specifically excluded constitutionally protected activity and had a legitimate purpose, tailored so that it did not substantially infringe upon speech protected under U.S. Const. amend. I. The appellate court further held that the trial court neither erred in using the pattern instruction nor in refusing to give the proffered First Amendment defense instruction. The appellate court remanded the case for resentencing because trial court failed to articulate its reasons for departing from the sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The conviction of stalking was affirmed; the statute was neither unconstitutionally vague nor overbroad in that legislation was specifically amended to exclude pure expressive conduct under the First Amendment. The appellate court remanded the case for resentencing because trial court failed to articulate its reasons for departing from the sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, a public utility operating in Kansas, sought review of appellee Kansas Board of Tax Appeals' (BOTA) decision regarding value of its Kansas property for three tax years. Resolution of two of the numerous issues raised rendered the remaining issues moot. Appellant challenged its property valuation both as to the total value of the company and the portion allocated to Kansas. It appealed to BOTA, which determined it had to defer to the agency's valuation unless the standards of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-5a04 had been intentionally and grossly disregarded. BOTA thus found the capitalization rate appropriate, use of original cost was reasonable, and allocation did not have to represent fair market value. The court reversed, holding BOTA had applied the wrong standard of review. BOTA had to exercise its judgment without deference to agency valuation. Fair market value, based on the unit valuation method if practicable, was the proper standard for valuing the Kansas property of public utilities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants were drivers charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol. Appellants' licenses were suspended after their separate administrative hearings.

The breathalyzer operating manual did not have the effect of law; it was informational in nature. Provisions were enacted, independent of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) administrative regulations, in which breath tests were directed to be conducted under the KDHE protocols.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his jury conviction for first-degree premeditated murder. He received a hard 40 sentence under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4638. Defendant contended that the district court erred: (1) by declaring a witness unavailable in violation of his confrontation and due process rights, (2) in refusing to give an instruction on informant testimony, (3) by allowing the State's peremptory challenges during voir dire, and (4) by imposing a hard 40 sentence. The State filed a pretrial motion seeking to have a witness declared unavailable and to have her preliminary hearing testimony admitted at trial. The court found no error in admitting the witness's preliminary hearing testimony. Defendant was not acting as an informant for the State at the time he collected jailhouse information. Therefore, the district court did not err by failing to give an instruction on informant testimony. As to the preemptory challenges, the record supported each of the State's articulated reasons for striking the jurors. As to the sentence imposed, the district court did not err in finding that the murder was committed in an especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel manner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant naturopath challenged the Sedgwick District Court's (Kansas) ruling in favor of appellee Board of Healing Arts that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-2872a, relating to practice by naturopaths, unconstitutionally delegated legislative authority in violation of Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 1 and that appellant's activities, including prescribing prescription drugs, violated the Kansas Healing Arts Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-2801 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant naturopath prescribed prescription drugs to be injected into a patient. Appellee State Board of Healing Arts alleged that appellant violated the Kansas Healing Arts Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-2801 et seq., and that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-2872a, which permitted appellant to practice without appellee's approval, delegated legislative authority in violation of Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 1. Appellee also sought injunctive and quo warranto relief under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-2857. The trial court found &sect; 65-2872a&nbsp;unconstitutional, naturopathy unauthorized, and that appellant had practiced healing arts and medicine without a license under Kan. Stat.

The court held that &sect; 65-2872a was constitutional and did not establish a licensing requirement but rather limited naturopaths' rights to practice to those who had already met standards as of a certain date. The state, through appellee, had standing to challenge constitutionality. Naturopathy was limited to persons covered by &sect; 65-2872a. The court affirmed injunctive relief insofar as it prohibited prescription-giving, surgery, and using &quot;N.M.D.&quot; as a title.</SPAN></P>

He was committed to custody under the Sexually Violent Predator Act (Act), Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59-29a01 et seq. On appeal, the court reversed. The court determined that commitment under the Act was unconstitutional absent a finding that appellant could not control his dangerous behavior. Because evidence showed that appellant suffered from a &quot;personality disorder,&quot; which by definition did not include a volitional impairment, and because the jury was not instructed to find that appellant suffered from a volitional impairment, the court held that appellant was entitled to a new trial. Application of the Act to appellant did not violate the constitutional prohibitions of ex post facto laws or double jeopardy because the United States Supreme Court had already determined that the Act established civil rather than criminal proceedings as the Act was non-punitive in nature.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed trial court's grant of summary judgment to defendant, holding that plaintiff was not a &quot;qualified individual&quot; as that term was used in the Americans with Disabilities Act, because he could not perform the tasks assigned to the clinical supervisor. Travel was a fundamental part of plaintiff's job.

There was no reasonable accommodation that would have allowed plaintiff to perform the essential functions of his job. Plaintiff's Family Medical Leave Act claims were barred by sovereign immunity.

The court affirmed trial court's decision, concluding that a parole revocation because of a technical violation did not qualify as a new crime under &sect; 22-3717(f). Therefore, &sect; 22-3717(f) did not apply to appellant, and his equal protection claim failed. The situation of a defendant convicted of a crime committed while on parole was different than that of a defendant returned to prison as a technical parole violator, as the former would face an additional sentence, while the latter, who would not face a new sentence, after being found in violation of the conditions of parole, would either continue on parole, have his parole revoked, or be subject to any order the parole board would see fit to enter.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected appellant's argument that the constitutional infirmities that felled death penalty statutes in three other states required that a sentencing court be afforded some discretion in considering a &quot;hard 40&quot; sentence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district court denied petitioner stepfather's petition for adoption of his minor stepchild. That court found that even though the father had failed to provide affection and care for the child and had paid only a portion of the court-ordered child support after a threat of contempt, the consent of the child's father was still required for a stepparent adoption. On appeal, the Kansas Supreme Court affirmed the denial of the petition, determining that adoption statutes were to be strictly construed in favor of the natural parent's rights, and that although the father provided only incidental visitations, contacts, communications, or contributions during the two years prior to the filing of the petition for adoption, he paid a substantial portion of his child support obligation and, as such, did not fail to assume the duties of a parent as required by Kan.

The court affirmed, holding first that in view of the trial judge's assessment of the lack of actual intimidation felt by the jurors, the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial. There was no doubt that an underlying felony was committed in the commission of the murder, and the trial judge did not err in refusing to instruct on lesser included offenses. The two offenses were separate and distinct, requiring proof of different elements. They did not merge, and the consecutive sentences did not violate double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

Stat.

V and XIV. Problems included issues with the Spanish-language translation, the officer's false representations about evidence supposedly implicating defendant, and the officer's poorly translated suggestion that some sort of momentary though improper touching of the girl could be dealt with; [2]-Defendant's statements were also inadmissible hearsay under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-460(f)(2)(B) (2013 Supp.).

Admin. Regs. 102-1-5a was deficient; [2]-The evidence supported the SVP classification, as it established that appellant had a 20- to 25-year history of sexual behavior with minors and that his mental abnormalities--pedophilia, frotteurism, alcohol dependence, and antisocial personality disorder--made him likely to commit repeat acts of sexual violence; [3]-As the proceedings were civil, the right of confrontation under the U.S. and Kansas Constitutions was not implicated by Kan.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1020(h)(2)(A)-(H) (Supp. 2009). The driver had been arrested for driving under the influence, failed a breath test and had his license suspended by the KDR at the conclusion of an administrative hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">KDR contended that the district court went beyond the plain language of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1020(h)(2)(A)-(H) (Supp. 2009) by requiring the administrative agency to prove that the breath test result reflected the alcohol concentration in the driver's breath at the time he was operating his motor vehicle about 2 hours and 45 minutes earlier. KDR claimed that nothing in the statute required an officer to establish that the driver was in fact operating a vehicle with a blood alcohol content (BAC) of.08 or greater but that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1020(h)(2)(G) (Supp. 2009) required only that a subsequent test result determined that the person had an alcohol concentration of.08 or greater in such person's breath. The court upheld the decision because if the legislature had intended for that determination to be made as of the time of operation, that language could have been included in the statute. Additionally, the district court did not engage in any particular substantive due process analysis. As a consequence, the court was left to speculate regarding the constitutional issue which was not appropriate in matters of appellate review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district court's judgment was reversed and remanded with directions to reinstate the KDR's order suspending the driving privileges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, a Medicaid patient, sought review of a decision of the Graham District Court (Kansas), which upheld an administrative decision by appellee, the Kansas Health Policy Authority (KHPA). The KHPA had denied her request for a prior authorization for an out-of-state bloodless liver transplant on the basis that out-of-state services for her religious preference did not constitute a medical necessity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient was a Kansas citizen and a practicing Jehovah's Witness. She needed a liver transplant, but her religious beliefs prohibited blood transfusions. There was a medically accepted technique known as a bloodless liver transplant in which liver transplant surgery could be performed without a blood transfusion. The available evidence indicated that the bloodless technique was less expensive than a procedure involving blood transfusions, but there was no medical facility in Kansas that performed bloodless liver transplants. A hospital in Nebraska was willing to perform the surgery, but the KHPA would not approve on the basis that the patient's religion did not constitute a medical necessity for out-of-state services. The court overruled the decision. As the Kansas Medicaid regulations allowed for an individual exemption in defining medical necessity, the KHPA could not refuse to extend that exemption to cover the religious hardship without providing a compelling reason. The KHPA failed to suggest any compelling interest for denying the request for prior authorization for the out-of-state liver transplant. Thus, it violated the Free Exercise Clause under U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-455. The court agreed with defendant. The problem was that the trial court did not inquire of, nor did the prosecutor cite, a provision of &sect; 60-455 for how defendant's prior conviction was admissible. The prosecutor's rationale for admitting defendant's prior conviction was that it showed that defendant was biased, that he lied about not having a place to live in Kansas as required by the conditions of his probation, and that he could not just get up on the stand and lie. The court did not determine whether the evidence was relevant to prove a material fact under &sect; 60-455 such as motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident. The court held that the State failed to establish the relevance of defendant's prior conviction under Kansas law and that the admission of the evidence was not harmless error. Defendant's prior conviction was not material because the fact that defendant knew possessing marijuana was illegal was already established by his testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate asserted that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during his sexually violent predator proceedings. The court first determined that the Kansas Sexually Violent Predator Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59-29a01 et seq., was constitutional even though it contained no specific statute allowing a challenge the effectiveness of court-appointed counsel. The court also held that there was a statutory right to counsel in sexually violent predator proceedings, so there also was also a right to competent counsel. The court found that the inmate did not receive effective assistance. In addition to failing to object to the improper use of exhibits, the inmate's counsel failed to object to the State's cross-examination of the inmate's behavioral expert about a disciplinary report from 17 years earlier concerning a knife when there was no report of a knife but merely a report of &quot;less than dangerous&quot; contraband. The court held that in a case where the burden was upon the State to show the jury that the inmate was violent, a similar report from just five years earlier would have made a much greater impact than the report used and that counsel should have acted accordingly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the owner was investigated for dealing marijuana for a lengthy period of time, his vehicle was seized. Police petitioned to forfeit the vehicle because the owner had used it for selling drugs. The owner stipulated that the vehicle was properly subject to forfeiture, but he asserted that the forfeiture should be limited in scope under &sect; 60-4106(c) because he had only gained $ 250 from the drug sales connected to the vehicle, which had a value of $ 8,000. The trial court ordered that the vehicle be forfeited. On appeal, the court found the owner's argument lacking in merit. Pursuant to &sect; 60-4106(c), a court was entitled to consider all of the circumstances, including related criminal conduct not directly involving the vehicle. Based on the owner's repeated drug sales and his purchase of a &quot;dealer-level amount&quot; of marijuana, forfeiture of the vehicle was not grossly disproportionate to the repeated criminal conduct. Further, &sect; 61-4106(c) was not unconstitutionally vague, as it provided objective factors that prevented courts from arbitrarily and discriminatorily applying it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant provided care for children in her home.

She did not check on the child again until 12:30 p.m., at which time she discovered that the child had died due to strangulation. She was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in failing to give a specific intent instruction with regard to the underlying crime of endangering a child. Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3608 did not require proof of any additional element of intent over and above the requisite general criminal intent: that defendant purposely, willfully, and non-accidentally placed the child in a situation where the child's life, body, or health might have been injured or endangered. The statute contained no language requiring defendant to have known that harm or injury to the child could result as a consequence of her actions. Further, because defendant's state of mind with regard to resulting injury or harm was not an issue, the trial court did not err in denying her request to provide the jury with an instruction relating to general intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent one, a juvenile, filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the charge was barred by the statute of limitations. The district court (Kansas) denied the motion and found him guilty of consuming alcohol, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-727(a). Respondent two, a juvenile, also filed a motion to dismiss which was denied. The trial court found him guilty of battery, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3412(a)(2). Both respondents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondents argued that the district court erred by denying their motions to dismiss. The appellate court held that the district court erred because the common-law rule requiring a prompt and speedy trial should have been applicable in proceedings under the Revised Kansas Juvenile Justice Code (KJJC). It was a rule to enforce a judicial order and thus ancillary to judicial authority, not in derogation of legislative intent. The rule enforced a right that was basic to a free society, the right of an accused to be arrested within the statute of limitations before charges were stale and evidence lost. Proceedings under the KJJC were akin to adult criminal proceedings and the same core values protected under the common law were equally at risk in juvenile proceedings. Finally, application of the rule in juvenile proceedings would deter the untimely reach of the KJJC to arrest adults on stale warrants for offenses committed years earlier during their adolescence. As to respondent one, he was arrested when he was 15 or 16 years of age for consuming alcohol, a class C misdemeanor. However, a warrant was not issued until three years later. The charge would have been dismissed for an adult.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent one's conviction had to be vacated and the underlying juvenile proceeding dismissed. Respondent two's case had to be remanded for a determination as to whether the warrant was executed without unreasonable delay.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals agreed. By treating the defendant's argument as a constitutional one--rather than a basis for finding a substantial and compelling reason to depart, the district court made no consideration of whether the facts of defendant's case made the sentence disproportionate. The sentencing judge in defendant's case was required to consider the proportionality of the sentence to the severity of the crime and defendant's criminal history. By treating the claim solely as a constitutional challenge, the district court incorrectly concluded that it lacked authority to consider disproportionality on the facts of this case. By cabining the factual matters on one side and proportionality on the other, the court failed to give any individualized consideration to the defendant's argument that the disproportionality of his sentence, on the specific facts of his case, was a substantial and compelling reason to depart. By doing so, the court denied defendant due process by refusing to consider individualized proportionality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant's neighbor was found dead, lying in a pool of blood with 56 knife wounds, defendant was charged with intentional second degree murder. Following execution of a search warrant at defendant's home, he was also charged with both possession of both marijuana and drug paraphernalia. Defendant was tried before a jury, and the State in closing arguments referenced famous historical crimes to demonstrate that it did not have to know the motive for the crimes to prove that a particular person committed them; it also asked the jurors to consider what they felt in their hearts in determining whether the State had met its burden of proof. The jury found defendant of all three crimes. The state supreme court found that (1) the historical reference was not an improper comment; (2) asking the jurors to consider what they felt in their hearts was improper, but was not prejudicial considering the comment was made in instructing the jury on the proper burden of proof and in wake of the strong evidence against defendant; (3) the jury was either properly instructed or erroneous instructions were harmless error; and (4) defendant was properly sentenced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant claimant sought review of the Workers Compensation Board (Kansas), which denied her claim for workers' compensation death benefits in favor of appellee, a decedent's employer and its insurer. The claimant had set forth the action by alleging that she was entitled to benefits under a common law marriage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant asserted that the Board did not follow Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-621(d) (Supp. 2009) because it ignored uncontroverted evidence. The court disagreed because the claimant cited no authority to suggest that the Kansas Judicial Review Act controlled the Board's scope of review and the claimant's own statements during her deposition contradicted most, if not all, of the evidence she suggested was uncontroverted or the uncontroverted evidence was irrelevant to whether a present marriage agreement existed between her and the decedent worker. Specifically, the claimant argued that it was uncontroverted that she held out to the public her married name, present intent to be married, and publicly lived with the children of her and the decedent with a wedding ring on her finger. However, the claimant also testified that she introduces herself to others by using her maiden name, her driver's license listed her maiden name, and she signed tax returns using her maiden name. Further, she testified that she and the decedent exchanged engagement rings but at no time did any person refer to the rings as wedding rings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Patient argued, inter alia, that he had a constitutional right to counsel. The court of appeals agreed. The United States Supreme Court recognized a limited right to counsel in some civil proceedings. A constitutional right to counsel was recognized when a person confined under the Kansas Sexually Violent Predator Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59-29a01 et seq. presented a habeas corpus petition under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1501 that was not subject to summary dismissal. The rights available to persons confined under the Kansas Sexually Violent Predator Act were critical to the constitutionality of the entire statutory scheme. Patient's issues went to the heart of the program's constitutionality. His liberty interest was manifest. He contended, with sufficient basis to warrant an evidentiary hearing, that the treatment provided to him was so ineffective that it could never give him the help he would need to regain his freedom. A person like patient, who was involuntarily committed in a civil proceeding that explicitly recognized that the detention might be for a long-term period was entitled to assistance of counsel in resolution of such substantial claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his Pratt District Court (Kansas) conviction for aggravated burglary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A witness to an attempted burglary called police and gave a description of the suspect and his vehicle, along with a license number. Police officers stopped a vehicle matching the description, but the license number was off by a letter. The investigating officer told the witness that they had located a vehicle like the one he described and asked the witness to come and have a look at the individual to see if it was the robber. The court found that the investigating officer was continuously working on this case until the time he made contact with defendant in another county. The officer acted without unnecessary delay in pursuing the identification and arrest of defendant as the perpetrator of the burglary and his actions amounted to &quot;fresh pursuit&quot; under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-2401a(10)(d), such that he was legally acting outside of his own jurisdiction. The one-man show-up identification procedure may have been suggestive but in light of the multiple identification details provided by the witness at the scene and the close similarity in the license plate identification the identification procedure was not unnecessarily suggestive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant entered no contest pleas to aggravated indecent liberties with a child in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3504(a)(2)(A) and aggravated indecent solicitation of a child in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3511(a) in the Shawnee District Court (Kansas).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that lifetime postrelease supervision term under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3717(d)(1)(G) violated the cruel and unusual punishment prohibitions of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. amend. VIII, and Section 9 of the Kansas Constitution, Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 9 because more serious offenses carried lesser postrelease supervision terms. The court noted that imposing a postrelease supervision term might be constitutionally impermissible if applied disproportionately. Defendant claimed the length of the supervision rendered the sentence unconstitutional. The court of appeals disagreed. The fact that murder carried a shorter postrelease supervision term did not by itself affect the sentencing statute's validity. Defendant made no argument as to why the legislature could not require individuals convicted of sex crimes to remain under supervision longer than those convicted of murder. While the second prong of State v. Freeman analysis might render this arrangement suspect, it was not sufficient on its own to invalidate the statute and defendant presented no arguments or evidence regarding the other two Freeman factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate contended that he did not know that tobacco was in a sandwich being passed down from cell to cell. He claimed that he thought that it was a sandwich and that he was just the unlucky one who was passing it along when a guard caught him. On appeal, the inmate claimed that he was denied due process when he wasn't allowed to call two witnesses and that the evidence was not sufficient to convict him because no one showed he knew that tobacco was in the sandwich. The court upheld the decision. The hearing officer did not call the two witnesses but did call two other inmates that the inmate had requested. Those witnesses testified that the inmate was just one of several inmates passing the sandwich down the cell line and that the inmate had no reason to know what was in the sandwich. The hearing officer acted within his discretion in not calling the additional witnesses because their testimony would have been cumulative, irrelevant, or both. There also was enough evidence to support the finding given that less evidence was needed to find a violation of a prison rule than whether a person committed a crime because the inmate was seen obtaining the tobacco and admitted having it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When asked during the instructions conference whether defendant wished to have the jury receive a lesser included offense instruction on the attempted first-degree murder charges, she declined. She now claims the court erred in acquiescing to her attorney's request because the jury could have reasonably found her guilty of attempted second-degree murder or attempted voluntary manslaughter. The court of appeals disagreed. Under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3414(3), no party may assign as error the giving or failure to give an instruction, including a lesser included crime instruction, unless the party objects thereto. The statute expressly requires an objection as a prerequisite to raising the failure to give such an instruction on appeal. There is no requirement that it be given in every case. Here, not only did defendant's attorney fail to object to the omission of a lesser included crime instruction, the attorney expressly requested that the lesser included crime instruction not be given. Therefore, defendant's claim was barred by the invited error doctrine.</SPAN></P>

The investment involved the exportation of cattle embryos to Europe. The charges against him were filed after the Kansas Securities Commissioner had issued an emergency cease and desist order to him for allegedly violating the Act and then had issued a second such order for alleged continuing violations of the Act.

The search revealed drugs and drug paraphernalia. But in 2009, the United States Supreme Court concluded in Arizona v. Gant that a vehicle could not be searched merely because an occupant had been arrested when, the defendant was already handcuffed and in the back of a patrol car. Defendant argued that the evidence against him should have been excluded because his constitutional rights were violated. The court of appeals agreed that defendant's rights were violated, but did not agree that the evidence should have been excluded. The court concluded that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied because when an officer searched defendant's truck, the Belton rule had been recently reaffirmed by the United States Supreme Court. Both the Kansas Supreme Court and the Tenth Circuit had consistently applied Belton, and the Kansas Legislature had amended Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-2501 to allow a search to the extent allowed by Belton. Any officer in Kansas would have reasonably understood that he or she could search a car incident to arrest.</SPAN></P>

Following a bench trial, the trial court ordered the parties to share joint legal custody of the son, awarded residential custody to the biological mother, and granted substantial parenting time to the biological father. The appellate court, considering the biological father's appeal, found that the trial court applied the correct legal standard, the best interests of the child, in evaluating the custody matter. It also rejected the biological father's contention that the trial court failed to consider the biological mother's religious beliefs and practices as a Jehovah's Witness since there was no showing that such beliefs or practices caused actual harm to the son's health or welfare.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the time of the alleged crime, defendant was not yet 17 years old. The State successfully moved the district court for an order authorizing prosecution of defendant as an adult. The court first determined that the district court correctly denied defendant's motion to have his certification hearing tried before a jury. Apprendi did not control the determination of whether a juvenile should be tried as an adult. Simply because a juvenile tried in juvenile court had the right to a jury trial did not change the fact that juveniles had no absolute constitutional right to be tried in juvenile court in the first place. The court next noted that it was required to follow precedent which stated that the rebuttable presumption of adult prosecution mandated by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-1636(a)(2) was constitutionally valid. Finally, because the imposed sentences were within the guidelines, the court did not have jurisdiction over defendant's argument that the district court violated his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by imposing the high number in the appropriate gridbox for each of his convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dismissed the portion of defendant's appeal regarding his sentences, and it affirmed the judgment of the district court as to defendant's other challenges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the mother of three minor children, sought review of a decision of the Seward District Court (Kansas), which terminated her parental rights after finding her to be an unfit parent under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-2269(a) (Supp. 2009). Appellee, the State of Kansas, opposed the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother properly asserted that the district court erred in its application of the presumption of unfitness under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-2271(a)(5) (Supp. 2009). The State failed to plead or suggest that the presumption would apply with resulting due process implications. However, the matter was not reversed on that ground do to the mother's lack of surprise, but the termination was overruled by a lack of sufficient evidence. The State's brief lacked sufficient record of evidence supporting that the mother's unfitness was unlikely to change in the foreseeable future under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-2269(a) (Supp. 2009). A social worker had testified that she was unable to say there were setbacks as of the filing of the State's motion to terminate. A case manager also testified that she was of the belief that reintegration was not viable earlier in the case, but she was not asked that issue at the time of the termination hearing. The mother's therapist also testified that the mother could become a good parent. The district court also improperly failed to consider whether the termination was in the best interests of the children under Kan. Stat. Ann. 38-2269(g)(1) (Supp. 2009).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees oil and gas lessors sued appellant oil corporation alleging that the corporation breached express and implied contractual obligations by deducting from royalty payments a pro-rata portion of the amount paid by the corporation to a third party for services necessary to gather and transport the gas. The Stevens District Court (Kansas) certified the suit as a class action under Kan. Stat. Ann.&sect; 60-223(b)(3). The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the corporation asserted that the trial court improperly applied a lex fori to resolve the conflict of laws issue. The court held that although the corporation characterized the trial court's choice of law as lex fori, it was lex rei sitae, the law of the place where the property was situated. Here, there were no contentions that any other state's law should govern, and in such cases, lex rei situs was applied. The corporation also argued that certification was improper because individual issues would predominate over the common questions of law or fact as, in order to determine whether there was a breach of an implied covenant within the leases, evaluating each of the individual leases was required. The court held that this was characterized as the de rigeur defense and was rejected by most courts. Further, in a purported class action claiming improper calculation of royalties, there was no need to examine individual lease formation and the intent of the parties thereto for purposes of determining predominance of common issues in certification proceedings where, as here, a systemic common course of conduct by the lessees in calculating royalties payable was shown.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also claimed that the trial court imposed an illegal sentence by ordering him to post photos of the victims in his jail cell, erred in denying his motion to suppress his confession, and failed to exercise discretion in denying his motions for departure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that he was in custody when he made a confession so that his statements should have been suppressed because he was not given his Miranda warnings prior to his interrogation. It was determined that defendant's statement was completely voluntary, and the simple fact that his interview occurred in the interview room at the county jail did not in itself create a custodial interrogation. Defendant also claimed that the trial court erred by denying his requests for a downward durational departure sentence without stating why the proposed mitigating circumstances were insufficient to constitute a departure. The trial court was within its discretion to find that there was no substantial and compelling reasons to depart because three people died in the accident; defendant had a prior driving under the influence conviction; and defendant had a.22 blood-alcohol concentration at or within one hour after the time of the accident. The trial court lacked authority to force defendant to post victim photos due to a lack of statutory authority. Kan. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee Board of County Commissioners of Sumner County (the Board) challenged the validity of several annexation ordinances passed by appellant City with the consent of appellant landowners pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-520(a)(7) (2009 Supp.). The Sumner District Court (Kansas) granted the Board's summary judgment motion and denied the City's motion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The City asserted that the Board did not have standing to challenge the City's annexations of land connecting the City to a proposed casino site. The court noted that standing to challenge a city's annexation lay entirely with the State, acting through one of its proper officers, unless standing was specifically authorized by statute. Regardless of whether the Board correctly characterized the nature of its action under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1202(1), the Board was not authorized to bring a quo warranto action in its own name under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1203. Rather, the State, acting through a proper officer, could bring the action. The legislature did not extend standing to counties to challenge a city's annexation under &sect; 12-520(a)(1)-(6). More importantly, the legislature did not provide standing under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-538 (2009 Supp.) for any party to directly challenge a city's annexation accomplished with the consent of the landowners under &sect; 12-520(a)(7), the statutory provision used by the City. Because a proper action had not been brought by the State or one of its officers and no statutory authority existed, the Board lacked standing to challenge the City's annexations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the district court's orders granting the Board's motion for summary judgment and denying the City's motion for summary judgment, and it remanded the case to the district court with directions to enter an order of dismissal in favor of the City.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-215(c)(1). Also, the State would not have been prejudiced had the district court granted appellant's oral motion to amend at the evidentiary hearing. Additionally, the amendment would not have delayed the presentation of the evidence at the hearing. Thus, there was no undue delay in appellant's request to amend his motion to include claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. In addition, the State has never claimed that appellant's original Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1507 motion was barred by the doctrine of laches. If the original motion was not barred by the doctrine of laches, appellant's attempt to amend his motion 13 months later was not barred by that doctrine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with felony driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). The Rooks District Court, Kansas, ruled inadmissible two key items of the evidence against him, blood-test results obtained at a hospital treating him for medical purposes and defendant's statement to medical personnel about his alcohol consumption. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant refused medical treatment at the scene of an accident and refused a blood test. He later stated that he wanted medical treatment and allowed medical personnel to draw blood for treatment, but told them he did not want it provided to police; he also told them that he had been drinking, which was overheard by the arresting officer. The court held that the district court erred in holding that the limitation of the physician-patient privilege in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-427(b) was unconstitutional because it conflicted with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). The Kansas physician-patient privilege did not apply in felony and DUI cases so there was no statutory basis to exclude blood and breath test results. HIPAA did not prohibit the disclosure of information by court order, as was done here. Even if HIPAA prohibited the disclosure of defendant's blood-test results, Kansas courts did not apply the exclusionary rule to preclude admitting the information into evidence and the implied-consent statute did not contain any provision that limited the admissibility of test results obtained for medical purposes and not at the direction of law-enforcement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the district court erred by including three prior uncounseled misdemeanor battery convictions in his criminal history. The municipal court that convicted him did not impose a jail sentence, but it did impose probation.

The court initially held that a prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction for which the defendant received a suspended sentence or probation that did not result in incarceration could be included in his criminal history. Subsequently, the Supreme Court of Kansas held in Youngblood that a person accused of a misdemeanor had a Sixth Amendment right to counsel at the stage of the proceedings where guilt was adjudicated if the sentence to be imposed upon conviction included a term of imprisonment, even if the jail time was suspended or conditioned upon a term of probation. On remand from the Supreme Court, the court held that defendant's prior uncounseled misdemeanor convictions were obtained in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel and should not have been scored in his criminal history.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a medical malpractice case, defendant doctor challenged the judgment of the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) against him, arguing that the district court erred in limiting his trial testimony. Plaintiffs, the family of a deceased patient, challenged the district court's application of the statutory caps on damages under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1903 and &sect; 60-19a02.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The family of a deceased patient filed a medical malpractice claim after the patient developed pancreatitis as a complication to a medical procedure. At trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the family in excess of $1,000,000, but the district court reduced the award pursuant to the statutory caps on damages under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1903 and &sect; 60-19a02. On review, the court held that the district court did not err in limiting the doctor's testimony to that consistent with his deposition testimony. To allow the doctor to state an additional reason for deciding upon the treatment method would result in unfair surprise, which the rules of civil procedure were designed to preclude. Further, the district court did not err in applying the damages caps because their application was not an affirmative defense that had to be pled; rather, the statutes established procedures that the trial courts were to following after a jury returned its verdict. However, the district court did err in awarding prejudgment interest because, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-258, it was error to allow interest on a verdict for unliquidated damages for the time before entry of the judgment thereon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district court's award of prejudgment interest was reversed; otherwise, the judgment in favor of the deceased patient's family was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) that convicted him of two counts of aggravated assault under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3410(a) and one count of aggravated battery under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3414(a)(2)(B), arguing that the district court erred in failing to dismiss the charges against him based upon his prosecution in federal court and that the two convictions of aggravated assault were multiplicitous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's charges stemmed from an incident at the victim's apartment in which he fired a.22 caliber rifle at the victim three times, hitting her once and intentionally missing her twice. Prior to trial, he was convicted in federal court of two counts of possessing an unregistered destructive device and three counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition; the convictions stemmed from the same incident as the state charges. On review, the court held that, because the federal prosecution required factual elements not required in the state prosecution and vice versa, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3108(3)(a) did not bar the subsequent prosecution of defendant for aggravated assault and aggravated battery in state court. Further, that the two shots fired into the wall of the victim's apartment were fired 10 minutes apart supported a finding that there was a fresh impulse motivating defendant for each of the two times he fired a shot into the wall. Therefore, defendant's two convictions of aggravated assault did not arise from the same conduct and were not multiplicitous under U.S. Const. amend. V and Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Johnson District Court, Kansas, issued orders which applied Kansas law to the Pennsylvania judgment vacated its registration in Kansas, and ordered the garnished funds to be released to appellee tenant. The district court required the funds to be held for 1 year and required appellant lessor to post a cash bond. It refused to grant the lessor any relief under an appealed and stayed Pennsylvania order. The lessor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lessor argued that the district court erred in vacating the registration of the Pennsylvania judgment because a Pennsylvania court &quot;opened&quot; the confessed judgment. The appellate court had to look to Pennsylvania law to determine whether the judgment had to continue to be recognized and given effect in Kansas while the tenant attempted to &quot;open&quot; it in Pennsylvania. The district court erred in ruling that the ongoing proceedings in Pennsylvania could justify vacating the validly registered Kansas judgment. The judgment remained in effect until a verdict was rendered and any appeal was exhausted. The Pennsylvania court's April 30, 2008 order was not entitled to full faith and credit in Kansas because the order was on appeal and its effect had been stayed by a Pennsylvania appellate court. The lessor was not entitled to any relief under the Kansas Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgment Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-3001 et seq., specifically Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-3004(a), nor was the tenant required to post a bond under Pennsylvania law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, a judgment creditor of the former owner of a cemetery, sought review of an order of the Shawnee District Court (Kansas) in favor of appellee State of Kansas, which dismissed his attempt to enforce his judgment lien against cemetery assets. The creditor was the cemetery's unpaid caretaker. He pursued only property that was not devoted to the burial of the dead.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State filed a petition to dissolve the cemetery, declare its property abandoned, and transfer title of all cemetery property to a county pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17-1367. After the creditor was permitted to intervene in the dissolution action, the Kansas Legislature amended &sect; 17-1367 in 2008 to retroactively nullify judgment liens. The creditor argued that &sect; 17-1367, as amended, was unconstitutionally applied to defeat his judgment lien. The court agreed, considering three factors to determine whether vested rights had been affected by retroactive legislation. First, the creditor's remedial rights were not merely modified in some way, they were nullified. Second, the availability of pursuing other judgment debtors was not a substitute remedy. Third, there was no public policy impediment for allowing execution against assets of a cemetery corporation that were not used for burial. The court concluded that it was clear beyond a substantial or reasonable doubt that the 2008 amendment was violative of due process and unconstitutionally applied to defeat the creditor's preexisting lien rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the district court's order and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In instruction 4, the district court instructed the jury that the State had to prove that the crime of rape occurred in Kingman County, while in instruction 9, the district court told the jury that, when it could not be readily determined where a crime near the county boundary had occurred, the State could prosecute in either county. Although the instructions were contradictory and therefore erroneous, reversal was not required because it was not possible that the jury could have been misled. To convict defendant under any understanding of the instructions, the jury must have concluded either that the crime occurred in Kingman County or that it took place so near the county line that it could not be readily determined in which county the crime took place. Further, penetration by either the finger or the penis constituted sexual intercourse, and evidence of penetration, combined with lack of consent and a victim overcome by force or fear, constituted rape. A unanimity instruction was not needed where defendant was accused of penetrating the victim's vagina with his finger and, later, with his penis because the separate incidents were part of one continuous attack or event.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was pulled over for speeding. The police officer issued a warning ticket and returned defendant's license and insurance papers to him. As defendant and the officer were returning to their vehicles, the officer asked defendant if he possessed any weapons or contraband. Defendant said he did not and consented to a pat down and search of his car. Drugs and drug paraphernalia were found. The court found that the officer's interaction with defendant was consensual and not a seizure because, under the Thompson totality of the circumstances test, the officer's conduct would have conveyed to a reasonable person that he was free to refuse any requests or end the encounter. The officer's testimony about the stop was more credible than defendant's and was supported by a video of the stop admitted into evidence. Because the totality of the circumstances weighed in favor of a consensual encounter, defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied. Defendant also waived his objection to admission of the drug lab report because he did not timely object under Kan. Stat. Ann &sect; 22-3437(3), the provisions of which mirrored the simplest form of a notice-and-demand statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Johnson District Court (Kansas) denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence and entered final judgments of conviction after if found defendant guilty of criminal possession of a firearm and carrying a concealed firearm. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer stopped defendant's vehicle after noticing it was  weaving in and out of lanes, and weaving within its own lane of travel. During the stop, the officer seized a handgun defendant possessed. The trial court then denied his motion to suppress evidence. After a bench trial, defendant was found guilty of possession of a firearm, a felony, and carrying a concealed firearm, a misdemeanor. The appellate court found that (1) the trial court properly denied the motion to suppress evidence, as the officer's observation of the weaving justified a temporary investigative stop; (2) the criminal possession conviction, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4204(a), had to be reversed, as it had to be based on certain enumerated felonies and while the State tried to use his prior attempted possession of cocaine conviction, attempted possession was not that statute's possession offense; (3) statutes barring concealed firearms were presumptively constitutional under the Second Amendment and that presumption was not rebutted; and (4) the trial court in imposing attorney fees did not adequately inquire into his ability to reimburse the Board of Indigents' Defense Services for representing him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed both the denial of defendant's motion to suppress evidence and conviction for carrying a concealed firearm, reversed the conviction for criminal possession of a firearm, and vacated the imposition of attorney fees against defendant. It then directed the trial court upon remand of the case to dismiss the criminal possession conviction and reconsider the attorney fee award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Johnson District Court (Kansas), which convicted him of criminal possession of a firearm under Kan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress evidence, that his conviction for criminal possession was inappropriate because &sect; 21-4204(a)(4)(A) did not apply to his prior felony for an attempt crime, and that the trial court erred in ordering him to reimburse the Board of Indigents' Defense Services (BIDS). The court held that a trooper's observation of defendant's car weaving in and out of lanes without signaling and his car's weaving within its proper lane of travel, standing alone, created sufficient reasonable suspicion to justify a temporary investigative stop. The conviction for criminal possession had to be reversed because the separate crime of attempted possession of cocaine was not explicitly included within &sect; 21-4204(a)(4)(A), and thus could not be used to convict defendant of criminal possession of a firearm thereunder. Finally, the trial court erred in ordering defendant to pay BIDS fees pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-4513 as it failed to first make a proper Robinson inquiry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant alleged father sought review of a judgment from the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas), which upheld the registration and enforcement in Kansas of a default paternity judgment and child-support order against him which was obtained in Germany by appellee German mother. The father had been stationed in Germany during his military service but alleged that he did not know about the German proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The registration of the German order took place under the procedures of the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA), which was adopted in Kansas in 1994 by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23-9,101 et seq. Although the father originally challenged the registration of the German order in Kansas, he failed to appear at the hearing. After the registration was confirmed, he contended that the German court lacked personal jurisdiction over him. The court held that the district court correctly ruled that the father lost the chance to litigate the jurisdiction issue in Kansas when he failed to raise the issue before the German order was registered and confirmed there. Once a child support order's registration was confirmed, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23-9,608 precluded further contest of the order with respect to any matter such as a lack of jurisdiction that could have been asserted at the time of registration. Further, the specific provision of &sect; 23-9,608 controlled over the more general provision of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-260(b) providing for relief from void judgments. Finally, the Kansas Attorney General's 1992 declaration that Germany should be treated as a state was still valid for UIFSA purposes.</SPAN></P>

When defendant pleaded guilty, he waived any alleged defects with the constitutional dimensions of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3505(a)(1). The Court of Appeals of Kansas lacked jurisdiction over the issue, because it was not raised in defendant's notice of appeal. The district court did not err when it ordered defendant to register as a sexual offender under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-4902(c)(14), because the crime was sexually motivated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant filed a pro se petition for discharge or transitional release, arguing that he had successfully completed treatment and that his current mental condition made him safe to be discharged from the Sexual Predator Treatment Program.

The district court summarily denied appellant's petition for discharge. The Court of Appeals of Kansas was troubled by the summary denial of an independent evaluation and the absence of any finding that an independent evaluation was not &quot;necessary&quot; as required by Kan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was overcome by jealousy during an altercation with his live-in girlfriend, and began hitting the victim on the head. She ran into the bathroom to escape where defendant pushed her onto the bathroom floor; she struck her head on the bathtub. Defendant then got on top of her and began to strangle her to the point that she almost lost consciousness. The Court of Appeals of Kansas held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction for both aggravated battery and criminal restraint. Defendant interfered with the victim's liberty, because she had to struggle to free herself. Defendant's conviction for two counts of domestic battery in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3412a did not violate Kansas' Defense of Marriage Amendment set forth in Kan. Const. art. 15, &sect; 16, because defendant's conviction was not predicated upon the State recognizing his relationship with the victim as bearing all the hallmarks of a conventional marriage. The trial court did not violate Apprendi by considering his prior adult convictions for sentencing purposes without requiring those convictions to be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the Seward District Court, Kansas, convicted defendant of identity theft, driving under the influence (DUI), obstructing official duty, transporting an open container, and driving after being declared a habitual violator, refusing to take a preliminary breath test (PBT), and making an improper turn, it imposed an aggravated presumptive sentence of incarceration. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The identity theft charge resulted after defendant was pulled over for suspected DUI and produced his deceased brother's driver's license. On review, defendant contended, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to support the identity theft charge, and the district court erred in admitting testimony regarding his refusal to take a PBT. The appellate court disagreed, finding first that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4018 did not require loss to the victim from the use of his/her stolen identity. Thus, while the &quot;victim&quot; in this case was deceased and sustained no actual &quot;loss,&quot; the district court was not precluded from finding defendant intended to defraud for the purpose of his own benefit. Further, it was undisputed that defendant used his deceased brother's identity to avoid officers knowing his real identity when he was stopped for DUI. Although defendant's refusal to take the PBT was admissible at trial to prove the charge of refusal to take a PBT, it was not admissible as it related to his DUI charge. However, the admission did not require reversal because the remaining evidence of defendant's guilt as to the DUI charge was overwhelming.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's appeal to the imposition of the aggravated sentence within the presumptive sentencing range was dismissed; otherwise, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State argued that the trial court erred in granting defendants' motion to suppress. The court affirmed on appeal. For purposes of the Fourth Amendment and Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 15, substantial evidence supported the trial court's factual finding that the trooper dispelled his suspicion of a possible violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1906(c) before he approached defendants. The trooper then had no reason to detain defendants to perform the tasks incident to an ordinary traffic stop and the trooper unlawfully extended the scope of the stop by questioning defendants regarding their travel plans and requesting identification. Because the scope of the stop was unlawfully extended, the court had to next consider whether the State established a break in the causal connection between the illegality and the evidence obtained as a result of it. Substantial competent evidence supported the trial court's determination that the consent to search was not sufficiently attenuated from the prior illegal conduct to purge the taint of that illegality. Thus, the trial court properly suppressed the evidence discovered during the search of the vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a state environmental agency, brought an action against defendant tire dealer in the Shawnee District Court (Kansas) to enforce a final action determining that the dealer was liable for clean-up costs at his waste tire facility. The district court granted summary judgment to the agency for $ 7,849 and costs, and the dealer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dealer kept a waste tire collection center. In December 2000, the agency revoked his permits and ordered the dealer to stop all of his waste tire collection activities in Kansas. In 2001, he was ordered to remove the waste tires. The dealer requested an administrative hearing, held in 2002. The Secretary of the agency affirmed the decision against the dealer, and he sought judicial review in 2003. In 2004, his case was dismissed for failure to appear at a conference. The agency then cleaned up the site and sought to recover its costs. The dealer argued that Secretary had erred in finding him rather than his predecessor in the business to be the owner of the waste tires; thus, in his view, the Secretary's final order was invalid. The court held that the dealer could not attack the validity of the Secretary's order in the agency's civil enforcement action. The only defenses available in the enforcement action were those listed in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-625. The options listed in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-621(c) were not applicable; these were available only in a petition for judicial review of the agency action, which the dealer had forgone by failing to appear at the conference.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State charged defendant with possession of a firearm on school property in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4204(a)(5). Defendant was acquitted, before the Johnson District Court, Kansas, of criminal possession of a firearm on school property. The State appealed upon a question reserved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer approached defendant, who was on school property, about the fact that her dog was not on a leash. As the officer was speaking with defendant, the officer observed a gun case. The officer retrieved a gun from defendant and informed defendant that it was illegal to have a gun on school property. The question the State posed was whether school was required to be in session or whether children must be present on the school property for a violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4204(a)(5) to occur. A person could be found guilty of criminal possession of a firearm on school property in violation of &sect; 21-4204(a)(5) even when school was not in session or children were not present on the school property at the time the offense was committed. The district court erroneously placed too much weight on the fact that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-4161 (Supp. 2008) and Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-4163 (Supp. 2008) expressly provided that school need not be in session for an offender to commit the crime of possession of drugs within 1,000 feet of school property. The absence of this language from Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4204(a)(5) did not establish a legislative intent that school must be in session.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the sentence imposed by the Stafford District Court (Kansas) after pleading no contest to a charge of aggravated indecent solicitation of a child in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3511, contending that the terms of his probation violated his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of a sex offense involving his grandchildren. The trial court sentenced defendant to house arrest and probation. As a condition of house arrest, defendant was precluded from grocery shopping. As a condition of probation, defendant was required to post signs around his house and in his car proclaiming his sex offender status. On review, the court held that the trial court erred under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4603 in prohibiting defendant from grocery shopping as a condition of house arrest because the condition constituted a deprivation of an essential activity and because the trial court failed to make the necessary inquiry to determine if defendant was able to obtain food by other means. Further, the trial court erred under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4610 in imposing the signage condition as a condition of probation because it was not reasonably related to the rehabilitative goal of probation or to the protection of the victim and society. The signage condition made defendant an object of condemnation and ridicule, only confirmed society's outrage against defendant, and was simply a punitive measure not reasonably related to rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sentence was affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case was remanded with instructions to sever the probation condition requiring defendant to post signs and to make additional findings of fact to support the grocery shopping condition and the departure from the term of probation recommended under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4611(c)(1)(A).</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's criminal history worksheet included convictions of three counts of battery. The three person misdemeanor convictions were rated as one person felony conviction for criminal history purposes. The trial court held that the State had established that no jail sentence was imposed in each of these cases; therefore, the State was not required to show whether defendant had counsel in order for the prior misdemeanors to be counted in his criminal history. Defendant argued that he served jail time for contempt based on his failure to pay fines in one of the misdemeanor convictions. The court held that in the case of a prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction for which defendant received a suspended sentence or probation that did not result in incarceration, the conviction remained valid and could be included in defendant's criminal history. Whether defendant served time for contempt did not impact this analysis. An indirect contempt proceeding, governed by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20-1204a, was separate and distinct from a criminal prosecution pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3102(3).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As &sect; 21-3504(a)(3)(B) had been interpreted, the appeals court found the State's evidence was insufficient to support defendant's conviction for aggravated indecent liberties with a child (solicitation), and the conviction had to be vacated. There was no evidence that a third party was involved in any of the alleged sexual abuse between defendant and either of the victims, as required by &sect; 21-3504(a)(3)(B). The State presented no evidence that defendant had solicited a victim to engage in any activity that might be construed as lewd fondling or touching of any person other than defendant. Next, defendant asserted that prosecutorial misconduct deprived him of a fair trial. The appeals court agreed. The prosecutor's comments concerning uncharged crimes against a victim's cousin suggested to the jury that the State had been prevented from charging defendant with crimes that he had committed. Under such circumstances, the prosecutorial misconduct could not be deemed harmless. Defendant challenged the admission of evidence related to several uncharged acts of sexual abuse, but made no attempt to characterize this issue as an issue deserving of consideration for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The aggravated indecent liberties with a child (solicitation) conviction was reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Shawnee District Court, Kansas, convicted defendant of one count of theft under $ 1000, in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3701 and one count of removal of a theft detection device, in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3764(d). Defendant appealed only the conviction of removing the theft detection device.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, defendant contended the district court clearly erred in instructing the jury. Because defendant died shortly after filing appeal, the State argued that his death rendered the appeal moot. The appellate court agreed with defendant and disagreed with the State; defendant's death did not abate his appeal as it was in the interest of the public that the issues raised on appeal be adjudicated on the merits. The appellate court also found that the instruction given by the trial court, even though in line with the recommended Kansas Pattern Instruction at the time, was an improper statement of the law and clearly erroneous as it did not contain a reference to the specific intent required to establish a crime under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3764(d). Defendant testified he did not know there were theft detection devices on the DVDs he attempted to steal, and there was no clear definitive evidence that established otherwise. Further, there was a real possibility the jury would have returned a different verdict had it been instructed that the State had to prove defendant &quot;intentionally removed the theft detection device,&quot; as required by the statue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed and remanded with instructions to vacate defendant's conviction for removal of a theft detection device.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Johnson District Court (Kansas) convicting him for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1567(a)(3) (2005). After finding that defendant had three prior DUI convictions, the district court sentenced defendant to one year in jail, a fine of $ 2,500, court costs, attorney fees, and a requirement of 12 months of substance abuse treatment upon release from jail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An officer stopped defendant's truck and administered field sobriety tests. Defendant refused a breath test. The district court denied defendant's motion in limine to exclude reference to the field sobriety exercises as &quot;tests,&quot; and from indicating that he had failed. The court held that it was appropriate for the arresting officer to testify that field sobriety tests were administered to defendant and that, based upon the officer's training and experience, the driver failed those tests. However, the officer's testimony went beyond an indication that defendant attempted to perform certain field sobriety tests and demonstrated multiple clues of intoxication. The officer's testimony that there was a 68 percent likelihood that defendant was under the influence to an unlawful degree was scientific opinion that was not properly supported by expert testimony. The error was not harmless. The admission of evidence regarding defendant's refusal to take the breath test did not violate his rights under U.S. Const. amends. V, VI, XIV. The Board of Indigents' Defense Services attorney fees, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-4513, were vacated for failure to consider defendant's financial resources.</SPAN></P>

The Barton District Court, Kansas, reversed, concluding that the trust had been properly modified to be exempt for Medicaid eligibility purposes. The KHPA appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the KHPA contended the district court erroneously interpreted Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39-709(e)(3) (Supp. 2007) in determining that the modification of the trust complied with a statutory amendment. The appellate court disagreed, finding first that there was no dispute that the trust was funded exclusively from resources of a person who owed no duty of support to the trustee; the settlors, as parents of the beneficiary (an adult disabled child), owed no legal duty of support to the beneficiary. Further, the original trust instrument contained specific contemporaneous language expressing the settlors' intent that the trust be supplemental to public assistance. While the original trust instrument did not make any specific reference to Medicaid, medical assistance, or Title XIX of the Social Security Act, this requirement was not included in &sect; 39-709(e)(3) until a later amendment. The successor trustee attempted to comply with the amendment by modifying the language of the trust. The change in the statute was a circumstance not anticipated by the original settlors. The appellate court concluded that the trust did not disqualify the beneficiary from receiving Medicaid assistance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that: (i) a delay in the appeal process violated her due process rights; (ii) Kan. Stat.

On appeal, the court concluded that although the delay of over two years in the appeal process could have been inordinate, defendant failed to demonstrate sufficient assertion of her rights or actual prejudice to establish a constitutional violation. The court also rejected defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 8-1001(i) because there could be no derivative constitutional right to bar evidence of an invocation of something that itself was not a constitutional right. Finally, the court concluded that defendant's sentencing challenge was controlled by precedent from the Kansas Supreme Court that enhancement of a sentence by reason of a prior conviction did not violate defendant's constitutional rights under U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant juvenile was adjudicated a juvenile offender by the Jefferson District Court, Kansas, for breaking into and vandalizing and a church, along with another juvenile. He was charged with burglary and criminal damage to property in excess of $ 1,000, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 21-3720(a)(1), 21-3201(b), 21-3715. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that damages evidence was properly admitted. The church's pastor was the &quot;owner&quot; of church property, within the meaning of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3110(13), for purposes of testifying to the value of property. His testimony, together with that of an officer, established that extensive damage throughout the church easily exceeded the $ 1,000 necessary to support the conviction. The court also held that (1) the juvenile code applied to the 12-year-old appellant, despite his argument that developmental disabilities caused him to have the cognitive and emotional maturity of a child under the age of 10; (2) appellant's original counsel was not rendered ineffective by representing both appellant and his accomplice; and (3) appellant's alleged diminished capacity did not negate the intent element on either offense. Appellant intentionally entered the church and intentionally broke windows, lights, and mirrors, caused sinks and toilets to overflow, overturned electronic organs, and wrote profanity on a bathroom door. Given the extent of the damage, it was apparent that he made a decision to stay inside the church to complete the nine-room rampage.</SPAN></P>

His level was.11, and he was arrested. At the hearing on the motion to suppress, the officer stated that the preliminary breath test (PBT) device was digital and possibly manufactured by CMI--although he was not sure.

Ann. &sect;&sect; 21-3506, 21-3504; (2) the aggravating factor set forth in &sect; 21-4716(c)(2)(D) was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad; (3) the district court was not required to make a pretrial analysis of whether a fiduciary relationship was a proper factor to be presented to the jury; and (4) the existence of a fiduciary relationship could be found beyond a reasonable doubt because the evidence showed that defendant was accepted into the victim's family, was generous to the children, was regularly entrusted with their care, and became like a member of the family.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant rancher challenged a judgment of the Morris District Court (Kansas) that affirmed the damages awarded by appellee county commission resulting from the closure of access roads abutting the rancher's leasehold estate, arguing that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 68-102a, 68-107, and 60-2101(d) were unconstitutional because they permitted the county commission, as an adverse party, to decide damages and limited judicial review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The rancher leased land for cattle grazing, and four unimproved, rarely used roadways reached the north end of the property. When the county closed two of the roads, the rancher sought damages for the closure. The county commission conducted a hearing on damages and awarded damages in the amount of $4,050. The district court affirmed the commission's award. On appeal, the rancher contended that, because the county would be liable for the payment of damages, the county commission was not an unbiased tribunal. On review, the court held that no evidence was presented to demonstrate that the county commission failed to act as a fair and unbiased tribunal when making its decision. Even if the court were to assume that a conflict was present, the judicial review provided for in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 68-107 and 60-2101(d) safeguarded the rancher's guaranty to due process, and the district court properly reviewed the county commission's determination of facts in assessing damages. The statutes were not unconstitutional but established checks on the county commission's findings to ensure that claimants such as the rancher were afforded due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant pled no contest to one count of felony theft of property having a value of at least $ 1,000 but less than $ 25,000, and one count of felony theft based on two prior theft convictions, the Shawnee District Court, Kansas, sentenced him to a 14 months' incarceration in each case, to be served concurrently. Defendant was ordered to pay the Board of Indigents' Defense Services (BIDS) application fee in each case. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, defendant contended the district court erred in calculating his criminal history score and ordering him to pay the BIDS application fee. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the State's exhibits at the sentencing hearing, offered to prove defendant's prior foreign convictions, included authenticated printouts of computer screens from the foreign district court, criminal case summaries, activity summaries, traffic displays, a status history report, and defendant's identifying information. These exhibits were sufficient prove defendant's prior foreign convictions. Further, the district court did not err in assessing the BIDS application fee against defendant under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-4529 as the statute contained permissive language allowing the district court to waive payment of all or part of the application fee if it found that payment of the fee would impose a manifest hardship. This provision involved the waiver of the fee rather than its assessment. The district court was not required to explicitly make this determination on the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer argued that the Board erroneously interpreted and applied the law pertaining to its application when the Board determined that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-201, Second and Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-201, Ninth did not apply to allow an exemption for the property. Upon review, the court determined that because the subject property was primarily used as a low-income housing facility, &sect; 79-201b, Fourth was the applicable exemption statute. Moreover, based on the plain meaning of &sect; 79-201b, Fourth and the strict construction that had to be given to exemption statutes, the court found that the taxpayer was not entitled to a statutory tax exemption because of its failure to meet the requirements of &sect; 79-201b, Fourth. Further, because &sect; 79-201b, Fourth was the specific statute that controlled low-income housing and because &sect; 79-201, Second was only a general statute,&nbsp;&sect; 79-201b, Fourth was the applicable statute to determine whether the taxpayer was entitled to a statutory tax exemption. Accordingly, the Board order was proper because the court previously determined that the taxpayer was not entitled to a tax exemption under &sect; 79-201b, Fourth.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury of the Johnson District Court, Kansas, found defendant guilty of interference with parental custody, in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3422a. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that his conviction, in the absence of a court order governing visitation or custody, violated his fundamental right to be a parent. The reviewing court disagreed, holding that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 21-3422 and 21-3422a were constitutional. Under &sect; 21-3422(b) it was not a defense that a defendant was a parent entitled to joint custody, either on the basis of a court order or by virtue of the absence of a court order. That language did not make the interference statute unconstitutional but rather protected the fundamental rights of a parent by preventing one parent from depriving the other parent of the right to be a parent in the absence of a court order or other custody agreement. The absence of a court order was not a compelling reason sufficient to allow a parent to secrete a child from the other parent. The court also held that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. Although defendant did talk to the mother almost every day after taking the child, he consistently refused to disclose the child's location. The evidence plainly showed the child was detained in another state and that defendant took the child without the mother's consent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled no contest to illegal possession of a prescription drug. She was sentenced to 30 months in prison.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) that convicted him of marijuana possession with intent to sell, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence because his rights under the Fourth Amendment and Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 15 were violated during a traffic stop when the police asked questions unrelated to the reason for the stop and he and his companion were unlawfully detained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The police stopped a van based upon the driver's failure to use a traffic signal twice when changing lanes. During the traffic stop, the police questioned the occupants, ran a warrant check, and obtained consent to search the vehicle, which uncovered contraband. On review, the court concluded that the police were confronted with a rental van from Arizona with a nervous 16-year-old driver. The police violated the pair's rights by asking questions unrelated to the traffic stop and by running a warrant check not only on the driver but on defendant as well, and while the police may have had a hunch that the driver and defendant were up to something, there was no particularized and objective evidence to support a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and to detain them any further. Although the pair ultimately consented to a search of the vehicle, the consent was insufficient to remove the taint of the of the unlawful detention under the Fourth Amendment and Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 15 because there was a close proximity between the constitutional violation and consent and because there were no intervening circumstances present to purge the taint of the constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>
