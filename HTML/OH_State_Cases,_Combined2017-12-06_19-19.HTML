</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted him of possession of drugs with a forfeiture specification, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11, and sentenced him to a period of community control sanctions (CCSs).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a guilty plea to the bill of information and he was referred to the Adult Parole Authority for a pre-sentence investigation. After a hearing, the trial court sentenced defendant. The judgment entry indicated that if defendant violated the CCSs, he could be sentenced for up to 12 months in prison. The State's motion to terminate defendant's CCSs for an alleged failure to comply with the terms, based to his failure to report his whereabouts, was granted. Defendant was sentenced to the maximum term of 12-months' imprisonment. On appeal, the court reviewed the Foster decision and held that defendant's sentence required vacatur because it was based on unconstitutional statutes and was therefore void. Accordingly, a new sentencing hearing was to be held pursuant to the Ohio Supreme Court's dictate in Foster, which was aligned with the procedure used in Geiger.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, vacated the sentence imposed, and remanded the matter for re-sentencing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was culpable for his actions of recording a 20-year-old coworker while she used the toilet; [2]-Defendant was not denied due process because a hearing was not required and the inconsistency among the maximum jail term for his voyeurism conviction and his 15-year registration period and 18-month maximum prison term for a failure to register violation did not implicate a violation of procedural due process; [3]-Defendant failed to establish standing for his substantive due process claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer prepared and filed a valuation complaint with the BOR alleging that the market value of a parcel owned by the corporation was worth less than the amount assessed by an auditor. The officer appeared on behalf of the corporation. After the officer appealed from the BOR's decision, the Board found that the officer had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by preparing and filing the complaint with the BOR and had deprived the BOR of jurisdiction to hear the complaint. On appeal, the court held that, pursuant to R.C. &sect; 5715.19, a corporate officer did not engage in the unauthorized practice of law by preparing and filing a complaint with the BOR and by presenting the claimed value of the property before the BOR on behalf of his or her corporation as long as the officer did not make legal arguments, examine witnesses, or undertake any other tasks that could be performed only by an attorney. Since the officer made no legal arguments and did not introduce any evidence or present any witnesses, the hearing did not require legal training or expertise; thus, the officer did not engage in the unauthorized practice of law under Ohio Sup. Ct. R. Gov't Bar VII(2)(A).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of assault on a peace officer, in violation of R.C. 2903.13(C)(3), and aggravated burglary, in violation of R.C. 2911.11(A). He was sentenced to 10 years and two months in prison. The convictions were affirmed on appeal. He filed an application under App.R. 26(B) to reopen the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel because counsel did not challenge the duration of his sentence and did not challenge the imposition of consecutive sentences. The appellate court denied the application to reopen because appellate counsel's performance was not deficient. The trial court had complete discretion to impose a sentence within the statutory range, pursuant to former R.C. 2929.14. It could have exercised its discretion to impose a maximum of 18 months for the assault and a maximum of 11 years for the aggravated burglary, but did not do so. Also, defendant was sentenced two years before the consecutive sentencing provisions were recodified by the legislature. Thus, there was nothing that suggested error with regard to sentences within the statutory range. Appellate counsel's decision not to challenge the duration of defendant's sentences and the application of consecutive sentences was not error because the sentences were entirely compliant with applicable law. Defendant was in no way prejudiced by the fact that appellate counsel did not raise an argument that had no chance of success.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1997, a judgment was entered finding defendant father to be the father of a minor child and ordered him to pay child support. Years later, the father filed a motion to terminate the support order based on genetic test results. The Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) denied the motion finding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3119.961 et seq. was unconstitutional as it violated the separation of powers. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that the trial court erred. The appellate court agreed and held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3119.961 et seq. was constitutional, as there was no violation of the separation of powers. Because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3119.961 et seq. provided a substantive right and not a procedural right, no tension existed between it and Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 5(B). Further, the trial court had the authority pursuant to its continuing jurisdiction over all judgments or orders issued in accordance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3111.01 to .19, which included judgments or orders that concerned the duty of support or involved the welfare of the child. Therefore, the matter was returned to the trial court for a hearing on the father's arrearages pursuant to Guthrie, wherein the trial court vacated a paternity determination after the putative father presented DNA evidence approximately two years later that he was not the father. The instant father's inexcusable conduct was comparable to that in Guthrie, in that he voluntarily and deliberately disregarded proceedings wherein he could have addressed his grievance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prison inmates sought review of a judgment from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted the motion under Civ. R. 12(C) of appellee, the Director of the Ohio State Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (ODRC), for judgment on the pleadings. The inmates had challenged the retroactive application of R.C. 5120.56, Ohio Admin. Code 5120:5-13, and ODRC policies to them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates were each convicted and sentenced for crimes that were committed prior to July 1, 1996. They received free healthcare from the ODRC until R.C. 5120.56 was enacted, after which they were charged co-payments for certain medical services based on &sect; 5120.56, Ohio Admin. Code 5120:5-13(B), and accompanying ODRC policies. The inmates sought injunctive and declaratory relief, and the trial court granted judgment on the pleadings to the ODRC. On appeal, the court initially noted that the trial court erred in failing to fully consider and decide various claims raised by the inmates. However, upon de novo review, the court found no merit to the issues raised. The court concluded that R.C. 5120.021, as amended, did not preclude the ODRC from charging and collecting healthcare co-payments and fees from the inmates. There was no breach of the inmates' plea agreements and no violation of their due process rights by the retroactive application pursuant to Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16 and Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. Their property interests were not violated under due process. Ex post facto claims did not apply, and there were no procedural errors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and monetary damages in the amount of $ 667,448. Appellees, the Ohio Adult Parole Authority (OAPA), the chair of the parole board, and 10 parole board members, filed a Civ. R. 12(C) motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granted the motion and entered judgment for appellees. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that he suffered prejudice because the trial court misconstrued the facts in his complaint. The appellate court held that, although the inmate did not ask expressly for a declaration that he be released from prison, asking instead for a declaration that his constitutional rights had been violated, he suffered no prejudice from the error. Further, while the inmate did not use the term &quot;guidelines,&quot; Harris adequately supported the trial court's conclusion that the inmate was not entitled to declaratory relief on the challenge to the parole guidelines or a finding that a change in his parole eligibility amounted to a ex post facto imposition of punishment. Also, because the Ex Post Facto Clause did not prohibit the retroactive application of R.C. 5149.101 and related notice provisions, the trial court properly dismissed those claims. While many of the provisions at issue became effective after the inmate's conviction, they had no substantive impact on his sentence or his eligibility for parole. Finally, his retroactivity claim under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 was not a claim upon which relief could have been granted in his favor as R.C. 2967.12 was remedial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of a judgment from the Greene County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which held that it lacked jurisdiction to address constitutional challenges to R.C.

(Ohio 2007), in the inmate's challenge to his reclassification as a Tier III sex offender (SO) pursuant to R.C. 2950.031(E) and 2950.032(E).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate entered a guilty plea to attempted rape, in violation of R.C. 2923.02(A) and 2907.02(A)(1)(B), and he was designated as a sexually oriented offender. After the enactment of S.B. 10, which implemented the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, the inmate was reclassified as a Tier III SO, which imposed different registration and community notification requirements. The inmate filed a petition to contest the reclassification, wherein he raised various constitutional challenges to S.B. 10. The trial court granted the State's motion to dismiss upon finding that it lacked jurisdiction to rule on the constitutional issues, and that the inmate did not sufficiently show an error in the reclassification. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in finding that it lacked jurisdiction over the challenges, as it had authority and responsibility to review challenged legislation prior to applying it. However, any error was harmless because the trial court's determination that S.B. 10 was properly applied included the implicit presumption that S.B. 10 was constitutional. Further, based on prior precedent, the constitutional challenges lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of a decision from the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, which upheld an apportionment of funds to a county's political subdivision by appellee county budget commission (CBC) based on an alternative method under Am. Sub. H.B. 329, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2002) with respect to the Undivided Local Government Fund (ULGF) and the Undivided Local Government Revenue Assistance Fund (ULGRAF).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county political subdivisions utilized the procedures under H.B. 329 to adopt a new method of apportioning the ULFG and the ULGRAF money for various distribution years. They initially passed resolutions to exclude the city's approval, and then passed resolutions that approved a new method of apportionment. Accordingly, the city had no right to vote on the adoption of the alternative method. The city challenged the CBC's apportionment of funds for various years in two separate matters. The Board upheld the apportionments, but it did not consider the city's constitutional claims. On appeal, the court noted that the results from apportioning the ULGF and the ULGRAF by the alternative formula in the county differed significantly from the prior apportionment method. It found that there was nothing unconstitutional on the face of the H.B. 329 amendments to R.C. 5747.43 and 5747.63. They were uniform for purposes of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26. Under the rational basis test, there was no equal protection violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2, and a retroactivity challenge under Ohio Const. art.

The trial court granted defendants summary judgment except as to spoliation against the officers. The officers appealed and the motorist cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist's conviction of a traffic offense the officers investigated was reversed. The appellate court held the trial court could not consider the officers' immunity because they waived that defense. The motorist did not claim they destroyed or altered physical evidence, leaving no fact issue as to her spoliation claim, which was limited to destroying physical evidence. Her claim that R.C. Chapter 2744, immunizing the city and officers, violated Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 5 and 16, on the right to a jury trial and to sue the state, was not well-taken as the Ohio Supreme Court had not so ruled. Summary judgment was proper for the officers as to malicious prosecution because they did not prosecute the motorist, there was probable cause to cite her, and her case was not terminated in her favor, even though her conviction was reversed. The city was immune as to her spoliation claim. Once her malicious prosecution and spoliation claims were dismissed, the officers and city were entitled to summary judgment as to her civil aiding and abetting and civil conspiracy claims. Her claim of abuse of police powers in violation of her state constitutional rights was vague and untenable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a foundation and former cigarette smokers, sued appellee, the Treasurer of Ohio, for injunctive relief regarding a contract and to contest the constitutionality of Am. Sub. H.B. 544, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2008) and Am. Sub. S.B. 192, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2008). The court entered judgment against the foundation, but for the former smokers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An endowment fund for tobacco use prevention and control was liquidated and the money in the fund was placed in a jobs fund. The issue presented was whether sections of Am. Sub. H.B. 544 and Am. Sub. S.B. 192 were constitutional. The state supreme court found that in 2000, a state agency was created to oversee the endowment fund. The agency, which entered into a contract with the foundation, was abolished in 2008. Further, the law enacted in 2000 did not create a right that was terminated by Am. Sub. H.B. 544 and, therefore, Am. Sub. H.B. 544 was not an unconstitutionally retroactive law under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. In addition, Am. Sub. H.B. 544 and Am. Sub. S.B. 192 did not violate the Contract Clauses of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 because the agency was not a trust. Therefore, reallocating the funds appropriated to the endowment fund was not a violation of a trust contract. Furthermore, the agency's board violated R.C. 121.22 by deliberating in executive session upon contract matters that it was required to discuss in open session. Therefore, there was no violation of the Contract Clauses because no contract was formed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators, electors living in various house districts as reapportioned by the Ohio Apportionment Board, filed suit against respondents, four of the five Board members, seeking a judgment declaring that the apportionment plan approved by the Board did not comply with Ohio Const. art. XI, &sect;&sect; 7 and 11, and a prohibitory injunction preventing respondents from conducting elections using the legislative districts set forth in the plan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators did not name as parties the Board and the member who voted against the apportionment plan. The high court held that neither was a necessary and indispensable party to the action under Civ.R. 19. As long as the plan satisfied the requirements of Ohio Const. art. XI, respondents were not precluded from considering political factors in drafting it. The Board considered political factors only after the applicable constitutional and other legal requirements were met. The high court rejected relators' claim that the Board erred in relying on Ohio Const. art. XI, &sect; 7(D) to justify violations of art. XI, &sect; 7(A), (B), and (C) because &sect; 7(D), being the last subsection, was subordinate to the other subsections. Art. XI, &sect; 7(D) was coequal with art. XI, &sect; 7(A), (B), and (C), and the high court would not order the Board to correct a violation of &sect; 7(A), (B), and (C) by violating &sect; 7(D). Given the discretion accorded respondents under &sect; 7(D) and related provisions, relators did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that respondents' purported failure to use the exact same boundary lines as the prior apportionment plan for a few districts constituted a violation of &sect; 7(D).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1998, defendant was convicted of two counts of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor. Under the version of R.C. 2950 then effective, he was classified as a sexually oriented offender. In 2007, the Ohio Attorney General sent him a letter saying that, pursuant to Ohio's Adam Walsh Act, he was being reclassified as a Tier II offender. The Huron County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) that he had been appropriately reclassified. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that R.C. Chapter 2950, as amended by Am. Sub. S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2007), violated the federal and Ohio constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto or retroactive laws. The appellate court held that the approach employed in the new Adam Walsh Act remained only a modification in the classification, frequency, and duration of sexual offender registration and thus, was remedial and civil in nature. As the amendments were remedial in nature, they were not unconstitutional on retroactivity grounds. The prohibition against ex post facto laws concerned criminal matters only and had no application with respect to civil law. Since the amendments at issue were not punitive, but civil remedial measures, no multiple punishments were at issue, nor was the Eighth Amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment implicated. Further, amended registration requirements did not offend defendant's right to contract as there was no evidence to establish that defendant's conviction was the result of a plea agreement, nor any suggestion of the terms of any such agreement. The trial court was not a party to such an agreement, and was not bound by its terms.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for driving under the influence after a police officer observed defendant's vehicle go left of center 4 times. The indictment indicated that defendant had been previously convicted of 5 or more violations of R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B). Defendant sought to dismiss the charge on the basis that the twenty year look back provision violated the prohibition against ex post facto laws. The motion was denied, defendant entered a no contest plea, and he was convicted. This appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that both the Ohio and United States Constitutions prohibited ex post facto laws. Such a law punished a crime as an act previously committed, which was innocent when done or which made more burdensome the punishment for a crime after its commission. The twenty year look back provision used past conduct to determine the classification and penalty for current conduct; it did not punish past conduct or create new penalties for the past conduct. An enhancement statute did not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws. Therefore, the twenty year look back provision in R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(d) was not an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his reclassification as a Tier III offender was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that the trial court erred.

Chapter 2950, with differing registration requirements. Defendant's reclassification, as a practical matter, nullified that part of the trial court's previous judgment ordering him to register for a period of 10 years as a sexually oriented offender. A final judicial decision had been abrogated. Thus, to the extent that the Adam Walsh Act required the modification of existing final sentencing judgments, such as defendant's sentence, it violated the doctrine of separation of powers based on the finality of judicial judgments.</SPAN></P>

Although appellant's entitlement to workers' compensation, being a substantive right, was measured by the statutes in force on the date of her injury, the same was not true for laws affecting only the enforcement of that right, such as &sect; 4123.65.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The AGA was a members-only organization that required members to pay an annual fee for membership rights and privileges. The Ohio Governor declared an emergency and he authorized the immediate implementation of Ohio Admin. Code 109:4-3-31 regarding skill-based amusement machines. The owners were issued a cease and desist order. Due to passage of H.B. 177, the owners' declaratory judgment action was dismissed as moot.

II, &sect; 15 because the bill as a whole concerned gambling. Section 2915.06 was not vague or overbroad because it required a finding of recklessness under R.C. 2901.21(B) and 2901.22(C). However, R.C. 2915.01(AAA)(2) was violative of equal protection. A vagueness challenge to &sect; 2915.01(AAA)(1) lacked merit, and the court lacked authority to review the emergency enactment of H.B. 177 based on a challenge to the right to referendum under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 1c.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court with respect to a constitutionality determination regarding one provision of the challenged statute, and the matter was remanded with instructions to enter partial SJ to the owners regarding the statutory unconstitutionality under the equal protection clauses. The remainder of the trial court judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held he knew his potential sentences when committing his crimes and Foster did not change them.

II, &sect; 28, because it created no substantively retroactive law, as any sentence presumed before Foster could be removed without defendant's consent, so it was not vested, nor could he enforce a specific sentence before sentencing. Foster's severance of unconstitutional sentencing statutes did not offend separation of powers because R.C. &sect; 1.50 let the judiciary sever unconstitutional statutes. The rule of lenity did not apply to defendant because the statutes he was sentenced under were not ambiguous. Foster did not deprive him of meaningful appellate review by excising findings formerly required for certain sentences because it did not remove a requirement to consider other statutory factors.</SPAN></P>

Its application did not violate the separation of powers doctrine, due to his prior adjudication as a sexually oriented offender, because (1) it did not order a court to reopen a final judgment but only changed the classification scheme, and (2) its requirements had always been the legislature's province. Its application did not violate his procedural due process rights by basing its requirements on his crime without a hearing because (1) a hearing was unnecessary as he was not denied a protected liberty or property interest, and (2) he had a hearing on the statute's application to him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sexual offender pled guilty to four counts of gross sexual imposition and was found to be a sexual predator. He was later notified that he had been reclassified as a Tier III sex offender. He petitioned to contest the reclassification. The Lake County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) denied the petition, finding that he had been properly reclassified under the new version of R.C. Chapter 2950. The offender appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offender argued that S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2008) was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (AWA), as applied to the offender, did not violate the separation of powers doctrine. The registration and notification scheme was not punitive in nature, but rather civil and remedial. Thus, no abrogation of final judicial decisions occurred when the offender was reclassified and subjected to additional requirements. Because it was civil in nature and not punitive in intent of effect, and not substantive, it was not an ex post facto law, or a retroactive law, and it did not constitute a second punishment prohibited by the double jeopardy provision. Additionally, because the offender failed to show an actual deprivation of his property rights, he did not have standing to challenge the residency restriction of S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2008). Finally, the new sexual offender scheme did not constitute a breach of a prior plea agreement as the registration and notification requirements did not affect any plea agreement previously entered into between the offender and the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to two counts of burglary, in violation of R.C. 2911.12(A)(4), and two counts of receiving stolen property, in violation of R.C. 2913.51(A). The Lake County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) sentenced him to 60 months in prison and ordered him to pay restitution to three of the four victims. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by imposing consecutive sentences. The appellate court held that the trial court was not required to make judicial fact-finding prior to imposing consecutive sentences for defendant's multiple offenses. Further, the sentence was not clearly and convincingly contrary to law because the trial court properly applied the purposes and factors in R.C. 2929.11 and R.C. 2929.12 and was not an abuse of discretion because the trial court emphasized defendant's lengthy criminal record and noted that he had been preying on society for most of his adult life. Further, the trial court's statement that it had considered defendant's ability to pay restitution satisfied the requirement of R.C. 2929.19(B)(6). Finally, there was no error in the amount of restitution under R.C. 2929.18. Although the total amount of restitution ($15,750) defendant was ordered to pay slightly exceeded the total amount stipulated in the plea agreement ($15,000), the trial court ensured that defendant understood that he was waiving any error in the restitution amount regarding one count. Defendant waived any claim by not objecting.</SPAN></P>

Later, appellant filed a petition for postconviction relief. The trial court granted the State's motion to dismiss. On appeal, the appellate court determined that because appellant had failed to produce sufficient, credible evidence demonstrating that he had suffered an infringement or deprivation of his constitutional rights, substantive grounds for relief did not exist. Therefore, the appellate court concluded appellant was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his claims for relief, and the trial court properly dismissed his petition for postconviction relief. Further, the appellate court could not say that the failure to afford appellant discovery during the initial proceeding to determine whether an evidentiary hearing was warranted rendered the postconviction relief process unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Plea (Ohio), convicting him, upon a jury's verdict, of felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B), aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, felonious assault, and the accompanying firearm specifications.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted as an accomplice in connection with the murder of a victim, who was shot during a home invasion in which the offenders planned to rob a drug dealer. The dealer was shot at the scene, but survived his injuries. Defendant first challenged the constitutionality of the felony murder statute, arguing that it impermissibly allowed the State to ignore its standard of proof and to prove its case by stacking one inference on top of another. While R.C. 2903.02(B) did not require proof of specific intent to kill, the statue was constitutional. Whether the conviction was based upon inference stacking went to the sufficiency of the evidence, not the constitutionality of the statute. Moreover, there was no impermissible inference stacking in the instant matter, and the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for felony murder as an accomplice under R.C. 2923.03(A)(2). Next, defendant's decision to attend the birth of his child instead of appearing for one day of his trial was a voluntary absence, not a violation of Crim.R. 43(A), as it was the product of defendant's own free choice and unrestrained will. Finally, there was no prosecutorial misconduct.</SPAN></P>

The magistrate denied defendant's motion to emancipate. The trial court adopted the magistrate's decision. The court affirmed. The 19-year cut-off age for child support found in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3109.05(E) (amended 1997) did not apply retroactively to the child support order detailing defendant's obligations. Former Ohio Rev.

The trial court overruling the landowner's motion for summary judgment and sua sponte dismissed the case in its entirety.

The trial court imposed a sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that his guilty pleas were not entered knowingly and voluntarily, that the imposition of near-maximum consecutive sentences was unwarranted, and that he was denied effective assistance of trial counsel. On appeal, the court found that Crim. R. 11 did not require the court to explain that defendant's sentences for multiple offenses could be run consecutively. Moreover, although not required, the trial court did essentially advise defendant of the maximum consecutive penalty he could receive for all the offenses. In addition, the trial court did not err by imposing consecutive sentences without making findings pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) because R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) was declared unconstitutional and severed from the sentencing code. Furthermore, the trial court did not err in imposing near-maximum consecutive sentences because the trial court considered the purposes and principles of sentencing under R.C. 2929.11, as well as the seriousness and recidivism factors listed in R.C. 2929.12. Additionally, the rape and sexual imposition counts were not allied offenses under R.C. 2941.25. Finally, defendant's trial counsel was not prejudicially ineffective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed after the Licking County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), in a Foster remand, resentenced defendant on 26 felony counts, to which he had entered no contest pleas. In a sentencing memorandum filed before the resentencing, defendant had argued that the application of Foster violated the ex post facto and due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Alternatively, defendant had asked for a continuance of the resentencing hearing so he could file a motion to withdraw his no contest pleas. As to the constitutionality of the sentences imposed at the resentencing, the appellate court noted that it had previously rejected similar ex post facto and due process arguments. Further, post-Foster, trial courts were still required to consider the purposes of sentencing found in R.C. 2929.11 and the factors found in R.C. 2929.12 relating to the seriousness of the offense and the recidivism of the offender. Thus, Foster did not unconstitutionally prohibit meaningful appellate review or destroy the legislative intent of the purpose and principles of sentencing. Defendant's claim that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to grant defendant a hearing on his motion to withdraw his guilty plea also failed. The minimum mandates of due process were satisfied because defendant was allowed to present the substance of his argument as to why he should be allowed to withdraw his plea during the resentencing hearing, and the trial court sufficiently inquired into the reasons for the motion to withdraw.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant opened fire on a police officer, who was patrolling an area known for illegal narcotics. Defendant later entered a guilty plea to three offenses, and a sentence was imposed. This appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that there was no violation of defendant's rights under U.S. Const. amend. VI. After the decision in State v. Foster, judicial fact-finding was not required before the imposition of a consecutive sentence. The sentence imposed in this case was not clearly and convincingly contrary to law because the sentence was within the statutory range for each offense. The trial court considered both R.C. 2929.11 and R.C. 2929.12. Moreover, the sentence did not amount to an abuse of discretion because due deliberation was given to the relevant statutory considerations. The trial court emphasized defendant's lengthy criminal record and found that consecutive sentences were necessary to protect the public and to punish defendant. Finally, the decision in Foster did not prohibit the trial court from considering sentencing factors found in the portions of the sentencing statute that had been declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals noted that the ordinance infringed upon a fundamental right, and therefore, should have been evaluated under a compelling-interest test. The court of appeals concluded that South Lebanon, Ohio, Ordinance 2000-15 was not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest and it gave preference to one class of truck over another; consequently it was invalid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered an Alford plea to attempted rape and gross sexual imposition. He filed a motion opposing the retroactive application of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (AWA), R.C. Chapter 2950, and requested that he be classified pursuant to the former law. The Ashtabula County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) classified him as a Tier III offender under the AWA. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the retroactive application of the AWA violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution and the Retroactivity Clause of the Ohio Constitution. The appellate court held that the trial court had no discretion not to apply the current version of the statute. The AWA was applicable because of defendant's sentencing date. However, even if the AWA had been applied retroactively, the retroactive application would still have been constitutional in the absence of a prior final sentencing judgment or order. Since the two prongs of the intent-effects ex post facto test were satisfied, the Ohio General Assembly intended that the current provisions of R.C. Chapter 2950 be remedial and any punitive affect of the provisions were insufficient to negate the remedial purpose. Therefore, the AWA did not violate ex post facto or the prohibition against retroactive laws. Further, there was no violation of separation of powers or res judicata because defendant had never been classified as a sexual offender since his original classification was under the AWA. Thus, the judgment of the trial court was never annulled, reversed, or modified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offender was classified as a sexually oriented offender. He later received a notice of new classification and registration duties from the attorney general, reclassifying him, pursuant to the Adam Walsh Act (AWA), as a Tier I sex offender and requiring him to register with the local sheriff's office once a year for 15 years. The offender filed a petition to contest the AWA, arguing that the AWA violated the separation of powers doctrine. However, the trial court held that the AWA did not violate the separation of powers doctrine. On appeal, the court noted that, following the trial court's decision, the Supreme Court of Ohio had held in Bodyke that portions of the AWA found in R.C. 2950.031 and 2950.032 violated the separation of powers doctrine, and it excised these provisions from the AWA. Thus, the court reversed the trial court's judgment that the AWA did not violate the separation of powers doctrine. The court reinstated the offender's previous classification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for 18 counts of vehicular assault. He entered a guilty plea to five of the charges and the remainder were dismissed. The trial court imposed consecutive terms of imprisonment on defendant.

Upon resentencing, the trial court imposed the same consecutive terms of imprisonment on defendant. On appeal again, the court found that defendant's argument that application of post-Foster sentencing principles to him violated his due process and ex post facto protections lacked merit. Foster did not judicially increase the range of defendant's sentence, it did not retroactively apply a new statutory maximum to an earlier committed crime, and it did not create the possibility of consecutive sentences where none existed previously.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of no contest, pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 11, to violating a loud music ordinance. He was sentenced on the charge, as a second offense. Following the entry of judgment and sentence, by the Youngstown Municipal Court of Mahoning County, Ohio, defendant appealed, arguing that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague, overbroad, and violated the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's plea of no contest was an admission that he was playing loud music in and from his automobile, so as to violate the ordinance. The appellate court found that an enactment was void for vagueness if its prohibitions were not clearly defined. In the instant case, the fact that the ordinance did not define the phrase, &quot;disturb the quiet, comfort, or repose,&quot; did not render the ordinance impermissibly vague. The phrase was substantially synonymous with &quot;disturbing the peace.&quot; Whether or not conduct was deemed to &quot;disturb the peace&quot; was measured by the reasonableness of the conduct as viewed in the light of the surrounding facts and circumstances. It was not unconstitutionally vague. Nor was it unconstitutionally overbroad. The city had an interest in protecting its citizens from unwelcome noise. The ordinance was not primarily directed at the content of the speech but at the volume of the noise coming from automobile audio systems. The ordinance's prescription against loud noises was primarily an attempt to control conduct, i.e., the use of the volume control, rather than an attempt to control the type of speech being broadcast. None of defendant's arguments were persuasive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to dismiss based on the destruction of the videotape evidence and also erred in allowing evidence of field sobriety tests that were not administrated in compliance with regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for a traffic offense and performed field sobriety tests.

He was arrested. On appeal from the judgment of conviction, the court found that defendant's motion to dismiss the charges against him based on the destruction of the videotape evidence was properly overruled because defendant did not show bad faith on the part of the police relating to the destruction of the evidence, and the State did not use the evidence in its prosecution of the case. With respect to defendant's contention that evidence of the horizontal gaze nystigmus test performed was erroneously admitted when it was not administered in strict compliance with the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) requirements, the court declined to determine the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(D), which required only substantial compliance with NHTSA requirements, because the jury acquitted defendant on the charge of violating &sect; 4511.19(A)(1) and, thus, the issue was rendered moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1332.04, precluding political subdivisions providing cable service from discriminating against private providers, was an unconstitutional interference with the city's exercise of its police power. The appellate court held the cable service's complaint that the town's ordinance violated Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1332.04(B)(1)(a) and (b), that the service was a cable provider in the city, and that the provider was adversely affected as the city's violations of &sect; 1332.04(B) gave an advantage to the city's telecommunications system, contrary to the statute, was improperly dismissed pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(B)(6), as all elements of a cause of action were adequately pled. When the trial court entertained the parties' constitutional arguments, it exceeded the appropriate scope of review on a motion to dismiss. When appealing the trial court's denial of its motion to dismiss, the cable provider did not point to an exception to the general rule that denials of summary judgment were not appealable, so the appellate court had no jurisdiction to consider the issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Greene County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) that denied his motion for &quot;declassification&quot; as a registered sex offender; defendant claimed the trial court erred in applying R.C. 2950.15 because he was sentenced before its effective date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to community control and classified as a sexually oriented offender following his 2003 conviction on charges of importuning, attempted unlawful sexual conduct with a minor, pandering sexually oriented material involving a minor, and illegal use of a minor in nudity oriented material. When the Ohio legislature enacted S.B. 10 in 2008, defendant was not reclassified, apparently due to his move to Pennsylvania. The trial court denied defendant's motion for declassification due to the absence of the required documentation. The appellate court found, inter alia, that although the trial court should not have denied defendant's motion for failure to comply with the documentation requirements of R.C. 2950.15, its error was harmless as a matter of law. Rather, it should have denied the motion for a more fundamental reason. Defendant was not a Tier I sex offender, and nothing in the law that existed prior to the S.B. 10 amendments provided for declassification before expiration of the 10-year registration term. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in overruling defendant's motion for declassification under &sect; 2950.15.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The assignment of error was overruled, and the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee department of jobs and family services informed appellant home care giver that it intended to terminate her Ohio Medicaid provider agreement. A hearing examiner determined that the department was entitled to terminate the provider agreement for violations of former Ohio Admin. Code 5101:3-1-17.6(D). The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) affirmed the decision. The care giver appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The care giver argued that the trial court erred by affirming the department's order. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err by deferring to the department's reasonable interpretation of former Ohio Admin. Code 5101:3-45-10(C)(7) or by concluding that the care giver had accepted, obtained, or attempted to obtain something of value from the consumer during her provision of authorized services. She knew that she was listed as the sole beneficiary of his life insurance policy several years prior to his death. It was not unreasonable to conclude that the beneficiary designation constituted something of value and that, at the very least, the care giver attempted, during her provision of authorized services, to obtain something of value from the consumer, regardless of the purity of her motives or intentions. Further, even assuming the care giver's standing to raise constitutional challenges, Ohio Admin. Code 5101:3-45-10(C)(7) was not unconstitutional as applied because it did not substantially impair the consumer's contractual relationship or his contractual right to designate a life insurance beneficiary.</SPAN></P>

The Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) accepted the plea and sentenced him to five consecutive one-year terms of imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his guilty plea was not knowingly, intelligently or voluntarily made. The appellate court held that the trial court fully complied with both the constitutional and non-constitutional provisions of Crim. R. 11 before accepting defendant's plea. It also properly explained that by pleading guilty, defendant waived his right to confront witnesses, his right to compulsory process, and his right to require the State to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, contrary to defendant's claim, the trial court informed defendant of his right against self-incrimination in a reasonably intelligible manner which did not convey to defendant that if he elected to testify, such testimony would have been meaningless. There was no indication that the remark engendered any confusion or misunderstanding. Further, defendant's counsel stated on the record that he had explained defendant's rights to him. However, because the trial court relied upon statutory provisions when it imposed sentencing, which had been found to be unconstitutional due to judicial factfinding, the sentences were vacated and the case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was affirmed. The sentencing judgment was vacated and the cause was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State and officials appealed Stark County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) declaration, sought by plaintiff city, finding Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3781.194, which among other things limited municipalities' rights to exclude manufactured housing from single-family residence zones, to violate the home rule amendment, Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city's zoning ordinance banning manufactured housing from single-family residence zones conflicted with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3781.184, which banned such ordinances. Plaintiff argued that the statute was a special statute that unconstitutionally limited the home rule rights guaranteed by Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3, rather than a general statute, that would have pre-empted its ordinance. The court held, looking to the statute as a whole, that it was a general statute, because although one provision dealt with zoning, there were other provisions dealing with various aspects of manufactured housing, so that its clear intent was to regulate the whole subject matter. The statute operated uniformly throughout the state, prescribed rules for citizens generally, and operated uniformly throughout the state under the same circumstances and conditions. The mere fact that the legislature decided not to proscribe private restrictive covenants forbidding such housing did not make the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed, and entered final judgment of constitutionality. Viewed as a whole, the statute clearly sought to regulate manufactured housing throughout Ohio, so it was a general statute, not a special one, and pre-empted conflicting ordinances of individual cities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractors and the county engineers contended that the CAT was unconstitutional to the extent that moneys derived from the CAT which related to sales of motor vehicle fuel were not being expended for the purposes enumerated in Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect; 5a. On appeal, the court found that Ohio's CAT, measured by gross receipts, including receipts from the sale of motor vehicle fuel, was not a tax upon motor vehicle fuel. Whether the CAT related to the sale of motor vehicle fuel was not supported by the background and history of &sect; 5a which historically was interpreted to apply to the specific taxes and not to general taxes. While in a sense the CAT, as applied to the contractors and the county engineers, had some relation to motor vehicle fuel, the relationship was too attenuated to find that the statutory allocation of the CAT moneys violated &sect; 5a. The contractors and the county engineers were not able to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the legislation and constitutional provisions were clearly incompatible.</SPAN></P>

Initially, although it was undisputed that the club was, in fact, exempt from federal income taxation under I.R.C. &sect; 501(c)(19), the record did not include a determination letter, currently in effect, from the Internal Revenue Service stating that the club was exempt. Thus, there was no showing that the club was a charitable organization as defined in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2915.01(H). Further, as to the club's claim that it did not consent to an officer's entry of the premises, the law enforcement officer made two entries into the club, without a warrant, and information gathered from those two entries was used to obtain a search warrant. It was also undisputed that the law enforcement officer was a member and entered the club through this membership.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father sought review of a judgment from the Geauga County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division (Ohio) that denied his motions: (1) to stay an ex parte order/notice to withhold child support, (2) for a hearing on order/notice to withhold income for child support, (3) to prohibit an award of arrearages for child support, and (4) for other relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the father argued that: (1) the child support enforcement agency failed to send him advance notice of the child support order; the amount withheld from his disability benefits should have been determined by the trial court and not by the agency; and (3) he should not have been required to pay child support arrearages because he did not know that the child was his until 1995, when she was almost 18 years old. The father's receipt of the appellate court's previous opinion telling him he owed $ 54,450 was insufficient to constitute advance notice. In the absence of advance notice and the opportunity to request an administrative hearing with the agency, the father's request for a hearing by the trial court should have been honored. The trial court did not meet the level of specificity required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3113.21(A)(1) in ordering the amount to be withheld from the father's disability benefits. The father's argument that he should not have been required to pay child support arrearages was without merit.</SPAN></P>

At the re-sentencing hearing on remand, all parties had an opportunity to be heard. The trial court thereafter entered consecutive terms of imprisonment and ordered defendant to pay restitution to the victim for medical bills. On appeal, the court found that the sentence was based on unconstitutional statutes pursuant to the Foster decision. As the unconstitutional portions of the sentencing statutes that violated Blakely, Ring, and Foster pursuant to defendant's Sixth Amendment jury trial rights had been excised, the matter required a remand for re-sentencing under the now-constitutional sections of the sentencing statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Lucas County, No. L-99-1083.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 13, 1996, Milton Woods, the petitioner herein, pled guilty to theft ( R.C. 2913.02[A]), a fifth-degree felony. Petitioner executed the plea form in open court which provided that, &quot;If I receive prison for a felony 3, 4, or 5, I may be given up to 3 years of post release control. If I violate conditions of supervision while under post release control, the parole board could return me to prison for up to nine months for each violation, for a total of 50% of my originally stated term. If the violation is a new felony I could receive a new prison term of the greater of one year or the time remaining on post release control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 25, 1996, pursuant to the plea, petitioner was sentenced to serve ten months in prison. The sentencing entry provided: &quot;Defendant is notified that * * * after prison release, if post-release control is imposed, for violations of post release control conditions, the adult parole authority or parole board may impose a more restrictive or longer control sanction, return defendant to prison for up to nine months for each violation, up to a maximum of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  50% of the stated term. If the violation is a new felony, defendant may receive a new prison term of the greater of one year or the time remaining on post release control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner served his complete ten-month prison sentence and on June 17, 1997, the APA placed him on three years of post-release control. On June 18, 1997, petitioner reported to the Toledo District Office and signed the conditions of supervision. As part of his post-release control, petitioner was placed in a substance abuse program and ordered to submit to weekly urine screenings. In addition, he was ordered to report to the APA office monthly and to actively seek employment. When petitioner failed to attend the substance abuse program, failed to report to his post-release control officer, and failed to report for his weekly drug screening, an arrest order was issued July 2, 1997. Petitioner was arrested on July 10, 1997, and under the terms of his post-release control, the APA imposed sanctions that petitioner attend and successfully complete a day-reporting program and that petitioner report to one of the APA's chemical dependency specialists. After petitioner tested positive for alcohol and cocaine use, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Toledo Police Department arrested him on July 22, 1997, for drug abuse, a charge that was later dismissed due to the fact that the substance found in petitioner's possession was counterfeit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of the drug abuse charge, the APA held a violation hearing on August 19, 1997, and at that time, the hearing officer sanctioned petitioner to a halfway house, where he was also to become involved in a substance abuse program, attend daily Narcotics Anonymous and Alcohol Anonymous meetings, and submit to weekly urine screenings. On October 17, 1997, petitioner was arrested at the halfway house when he was suspected of a theft, but that charge was later dropped. Petitioner was successfully discharged from the halfway house on December 17, 1997, but was instructed to continue to leave weekly urine screens at the APA office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 18, 1998, the APA issued an arrest order and declared petitioner a parole violator at large due to his failure to report to his parole officer and failure to report for his weekly urine screen. The Toledo Police Department arrested petitioner again on March 18, 1998, for giving false information about his identity, possession of drug paraphernalia, and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  post-release control violations. The APA held a violation hearing on March 30, 1998 and, at that time, petitioner admitted to all violations and the hearing officer imposed a prison term of one hundred fifty-one days, which was one half of the original term of his imprisonment. On April 2, 1998, petitioner was returned to the prison. On August 28, 1998, he was released again on post-release control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 5, 1998, the Toledo Police Department arrested petitioner for loitering and obstructing official business. On November 4, 1998, petitioner was released from custody and the following sanctions were imposed: that there be no more arrests; and that he gain employment, successfully complete substance abuse counseling, report for office visits twice per week, and successfully complete a halfway house program. Petitioner reported to the office on November 12, 1998, claiming that he had missed his appointment with the substance abuse counselor. At that time, he submitted to a urine screen that tested positive for cocaine. On January 16, 1999, petitioner was arrested for drug abuse, a charge for which he was later convicted and then sentenced to a community-based correctional facility&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for one hundred eighty days. In addition, he was charged with escape ( R.C. 2921.34) in relation to his failure to report to his post-release control officer. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On March 7, 1999, petitioner was mistakenly released from the community-based correctional facility. On March 10, 1999, he voluntarily turned himself in to his post-release control officer.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;At the time of his hearing on the petition for a writ of habeas corpus, petitioner's felony escape charge was still pending.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 18, 1999, petitioner filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Sixth Appellate District against the Lucas County Sheriff's Department and the Adult Parole Authority. On March 25, 1999, the last violation hearing was held and petitioner was sentenced to thirty days in the county jail and was subject to the control and supervision of the APA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sixth District held a hearing on the petition on April 6, 1999, and discharged petitioner from custody pending the decision of the court. On June 23, 1999, the Sixth District held that R.C. 2967.28 is unconstitutional in that it violates both the separation of powers doctrine and the Due Process&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions. Accordingly, the Sixth District granted habeas corpus relief to the petitioner and released him from the control and supervision of the Ohio Adult Parole Authority. On August 3, 1999, the court of appeals granted a motion for stay of judgment pending appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Reversed.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed of right from Court of Appeals for Lucas County, Ohio, order discharging petitioner defendant from custody on petition for habeas corpus, declaring Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.28, Ohio's post-release control statute, unconstitutional for violating the separation of powers doctrine and due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over several years, petitioner was arrested, sentenced, served time, was placed on conditional post-release control, which included a substance abuse program and weekly urine screenings. He was released, rearrested and resentenced several times, for probation violation and other, unrelated, offenses, including failure to report and failure to pass his drug screenings. In 1999, he petitioned the appellate court for writ of habeas corpus against respondents, the sheriff's department and adult parole authority (APA), after being sentenced to 30 days in county jail. The appellate court held Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.28&nbsp;unconstitutional for violating the separation of powers doctrine and the Due Process Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions. Accordingly, it granted habeas corpus relief and released petitioner, but stayed the judgment pending appeal. The Ohio Supreme Court reversed the holding of unconstitutionality, finding no separation of powers or due process violation, but affirmed the grant of habeas corpus, because the jail/prison sanction imposed on petitioner exceeded the statutory maximums, as the county jail was the functional equivalent of prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of unconstitutionality was reversed, as agency's discretion in managing post-release control did not impede judicial branch, violating separation of powers, and petitioner's post-release control violation hearings were conducted by neutral hearing officer and did not violate due process. But petitioner's habeas corpus grant was affirmed, as jail/prison sanction was exceeded.</SPAN></P>

Defendants, governor and others, asserted the defense of lack of standing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found the individuals had standing to pursue their claims under both a private and a public action. The administrative rules originally filed by the lottery commission on February 14, 2002, were not invalid because they were filed prior to the effective date of H.B. 405. In addition, the Ohio General Assembly did not unconstitutionally delegate its authority to authorize a state agency to conduct a lottery. Further, H.B. 405 did not delegate to other states that part of the general assembly's authority that could be possessed only by the general assembly. The commission retained sufficient control to satisfy the constitutional requirement that the commission &quot;conduct&quot; the lottery. Also, the Ohio Constitution did not require that the multi-state consortium's entire net proceeds be deposited into the Ohio Lottery Profit Education Fund. However, the sentence in H.B. 405, &sect; 36 (Ohio) which allowed the budget director to decrease the fiscal year appropriation was unconstitutional, as it caused lottery proceeds to be used for purposes other than to support public education. Finally, the inclusion of the multi-state lottery provisions did not violate the single-subject rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individuals had standing. The lottery was found to be legitimate and statutorily and constitutionally permissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparents argued that the statutory &quot;change in circumstances&quot; requirement conformed with the Ohio Constitution because the juvenile court had adjudicated the child to be abused and dependent and also because the parents stipulated to the court order that granted the grandparents legal custody of the child. The state supreme court held that the appellate court erred in finding it proper to return the child to his parents because R.C. &sect; 3109.04(E)(1)(a)&nbsp;unconstitutionally deprived the parents of their fundamental right to parent their child. R.C. &sect; 3109.04(E)(1)(a) did not violate the fundamental rights of parents either on its face or as applied in the instant case. The juvenile court adjudicated the child as abused and dependent, and the parents voluntarily relinquished custody of him to his grandparents. In addition, the grandparents had raised the child in a stable home environment, and the parents enjoyed residual parental rights, privileges, and responsibilities as set forth in R.C. &sect; 2151.011(B)(19) and (46). Although the record did not establish a change in the child's circumstances, that failure did not prevent the parents from ever regaining custody of him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant business was charged with two counts of illegally operating a sexually oriented business, in violation of R.C. 2907.40(B). Defendant filed motions to dismiss. In the first motion, it alleged that the complaints were deficient in that they did not allege that it acted with recklessness. In the second motion, defendant argued that R.C. 2907.40(B) was unconstitutionally vague on its face. The State opposed the motions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the legislature deliberately created a strict-liability offense. The court held that R.C. 2907.40(B) stated a strict-liability offense pursuant to R.C. 2901.21(B). Further, with respect to free speech, R.C. 2907.40(B) violated neither the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States nor Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The statute promoted the government's substantial interest in mitigating the adverse secondary effects of adult businesses and any incidental restriction on protected speech was no greater than necessary to meet that valid and content-neutral goal. Finally, R.C. 2907.40(B) was not unconstitutionally vague on its face. The only reasonable reading of R.C. 2907.40(B) was that it would, at the very least, prohibit an adult cabaret from featuring any sexually oriented performances of which it was a purveyor after midnight. Since that conduct would fall well within what can reasonably be understood as the core meaning of R.C. 2907.40(B), then R.C. 2907.40(B) could validly be applied to prohibit that conduct. Since there was a valid application of the statute under those circumstances, it was impossible to conclude that it was vague on its face.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held the domestic violence statute's protection for a &quot;person living as a spouse&quot; recognized a relationship approximating marriage, contrary to Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 11. The supreme court held art. XV, &sect; 11 did not implicitly repeal R.C. 2919.25 because the two were not clearly incompatible as Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 11 barred the state's creation or recognition of a legal status for unmarried persons bearing the attributes of marriage, but R.C. 2919.25 created no special or additional rights, privileges or benefits for family or household members. Cohabitation created a status to which the statute extended protection, but the state did not create cohabitation. R.C. 2919.25's intent was to protect persons from violence by close family members or household residents, while Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 11's intent was to bar the creation or recognition of a legal status approximating marriage. The two did not conflict. &quot;Person living as a spouse&quot; was only a class of persons for purposes of the domestic-violence statutes. It did not create or recognize a legal relationship approximating marriage. Persons in the &quot;living as a spouse&quot; category had no marital rights or duties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that former Ohio Rev.

The question raised in the appeal was what effect the supreme court's decision had on parties who settled a subrogation claim prior to the release of the decision. A subsequent change in the law could not apply retrospectively in instances in which contractual rights had arisen or a party had acquired vested rights under the prior law. The parties agreed to terminate the subrogation litigation before the supreme court released the decision. Once they settled the matter, contract rights vested with the employer. Consequently, the instant court found that the supreme court's decision could not apply retrospectively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents became aware of an initiative petition for an ordinance that would have caused the city to establish a domestic partner registry. Thereafter, the ordinance was approved by a referendum vote and the city commenced administering the registry. The city law director declined the resident's request to bring an injunction action on behalf of the city. Accordingly, the resident brought the instant action, asserting that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it abused the city's corporate powers under Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3. The other resident joined the action. Thereafter, the trial court denied their request for an injunction, based on its determination that no irreparable harm was shown, that the city was within its home rule authority, and that there was no constitutional violation. On appeal, the court found that the trial court's ruling was not erroneous. The court held that the ordinance was a matter of local self-government within art. XVIII, &sect; 3, as the registry conferred no right or obligation upon registrants, it was administered exclusively within the city, and it had no effect outside the territory of the city. Accordingly, it was lawful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee registrants filed petitions in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), contesting their reclassifications under Ohio's Adam Walsh Act, R.C. Chapter 2950 (2008), as Tier III sex offenders, arguing that it violated numerous constitutional rights. The trial court vacated the new classifications and reinstated those previously applied under the Ohio Megan's Law, R.C. Chapter 2950 (amended 2008). The State of Ohio appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Ohio contended that the registrants were not classified under Megan's Law by an Ohio court as the records in the registrants' cases contained no mention of a classification hearing or a court-ordered classification. The State, therefore, argued that reclassifying the registrants under the Adam Walsh Act was not a violation of the separation of powers doctrine as their original classifications were automatic under the law. The State also argued that the registrants did not demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that they were previously classified by an Ohio court. On appeal, the court found that regardless of the manner in which the registrants were originally classified, R.C. 2950.031 and 2950.032 had been severed and no longer were to be enforced. Thus, the trial court did not err in vacating the new classifications which were imposed by the Attorney General of Ohio and in reinstating those classifications of the registrants which were previously applied under the Ohio Megan's Law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city one sought review of the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Stark County (Ohio), which affirmed a trial court's decision dismissing city one's suit against appellees, city two and a county board of commissioners, regarding annexation proceedings and challenging the constitutionality of R.C. 709.02(E)'s exclusion of railroads from the definition of &quot;owner&quot; for purposes of annexation proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">City one entered into an agreement with a transit authority providing for the annexation of a portion of the authority's property to city one. Three days later, city two filed a petition with the board for annexation of some of the same land land; however, city two's petition did not contain the signature of any representative of the authority. The board passed a resolution granting city two's petition. In its action against appellees, city two challenged the constitutionality of&nbsp;&sect;&nbsp;709.02(E), which did not require the authority's signature on city two's annexation petition. The court held that city one lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 709.02(E) on the basis that the effect of the statute on the authority destroyed city one's contract rights in the authority's property. City one was not a member of the class of owners identified or allegedly being discriminated against by the statute, and no exception to this rule applied. City one lacked a sufficiently close relationship with the authority to assert the constitutional challenge for the authority. Further, city one did not demonstrate that the authority was hindered from asserting its own rights in the matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Portage County (Ohio), which reversed the convictions imposed on defendant by the trial court, based on the appellate court's determination that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 955.22&nbsp;unconstitutionally deprived defendant of her due process rights. Defendant had been convicted of various offenses arising from incidents involving her dog.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's neighbor informed a dog warden that defendant's dogs had attacked his wife. The warden made the determination that defendant's dogs were vicious. The warden informed defendant of her responsibilities as to confining the dogs under the vicious-dog law. On two subsequent occasions, the warden was summoned to defendant's residence due to complaints that her dogs were not confined pursuant to the vicious-dog law. Charges were filed against her under various sections of &sect; 955.22. Her motions to dismiss, based on challenges to the statute's constitutionality, were denied, and she was convicted and sentenced. On appeal, the appellate court reversed the convictions, finding that &sect; 955.22 violated defendant's due process rights by allowing the warden unfettered discretion to label the dogs as dangerous and/or vicious, and because there was no appeal mechanism. On further review, the court found that the inability of defendant to have contradicted the warden's opinion prior to his determination having been made violated her due process rights. Further, even at her criminal trial, the jury did not consider whether the dog met the definition of &quot;vicious&quot; or &quot;dangerous.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the ordinance was unequivocally intended to operate retrospectively. It did not create new obligations with respect to the developer's substantive rights. The developer knew of the city's position since the city had participated in the underlying hearings.

The manufacturers moved to bifurcate the punitive damages proceedings under R.C. 2315.21(B), which the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) denied. The manufacturers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturers argued that the trial court erred by declaring R.C. 2315.21(B) to be unconstitutional. The appellate court held that, first, because the trial court determined the constitutionality of R.C. 2315.21(B), there was jurisdiction to review the trial court's determination as a final order under R.C. 2505.02(B). However, the trial court erred by denying the manufacturers' motion to bifurcate the punitive damages proceedings pursuant to R.C. 2315.21(B) because it was a substantive law. While it mandated a particular procedure for tort actions, that mandate was for the purpose of creating and defining a defendant's right to request bifurcation to ensure that the jury did not inappropriately consider the defendant's misconduct when also determining questions of liability and compensatory damages. Although R.C. 2315.21(B) was necessarily packaged in procedural wrapping, based on the Ohio General Assembly's express intent to create a right of bifurcation to address potential unfairness, the law was substantive. Thus, R.C. 2315.21(B) did not conflict with Civ. R. 42(B) in such a way as to violate the separation of powers required by Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 5(B).</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found it previously held S.B. 10 did not violate these protections. S.B. 10 did not violate the separation of powers requirement of the United States Constitution because (1) classifying sex offenders was a legislative mandate, not an inherent judicial power, and (2) the legislature did not abrogate final judicial decisions without amending the underlying applicable law, but, instead, enacted a new law changing the different sexual offender classifications and time spans for registration requirements, among other things, and requiring that the new procedures be applied to offenders currently registering under the old law or currently incarcerated for committing a sexually oriented offense. The reclassification and related requirements of S.B. 10 did not violate the offender's right to contract under the United States and Ohio Constitutions because it did not interfere with a vested contractual right.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not err by refusing to grant appellant's motion to dismiss because there was sufficient evidence showing appellant did not make the right-hand turn as close as practicable to the right-hand curb.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, taxpayers and school district residents, sued appellees, a board of education, and the Ohio superintendent of public instruction, department of education, and board of education, in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, claiming the state's school funding system was unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the complaint for lack of standing, and appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants said it was error to find they lacked standing. The appellate court disagreed because they had no private standing, as they had no direct personal stake in the case's outcome, since they had not suffered and were not threatened with direct and concrete injury in a manner or degree different from the general public, as they alleged only that they were taxpayers and did not allege they were students or parents of students. They only contributed to the school district's funding as other citizens in the district, as opposed to contributing to a special fund, so their pecuniary interests were not affected differently than the general public. The case did not fall under the public-right exception to the personal stake requirement for standing because there was no similar case in which a taxpayer was allowed to bring a declaratory action challenging a school district's method of funding allocation. Also, the case (1) was not an original action seeking an extraordinary writ, (2) did not demand early resolution, and (3) was not of a rare and extraordinary nature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff billboard company filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants, a township zoning director and the township board of zoning appeals, challenging the validity of a township zoning resolution concerning billboards. The Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) overruled objections to a magistrate's decision and granted judgment in favor of defendants. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The zoning resolution mandated a 130-foot setback for billboards and also provided mounting and size restrictions. Plaintiff argued that the resolution conflicted with R.C. 519.20 and violated U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV. The court stated that it was the complete prohibition of billboards that conflicted with R.C. 519.20. The resolution did not ban billboard advertising, either by operation of law or in practice. Plaintiff conceded that it would be possible to erect billboards on several of the subject properties, although this might require some interference with existing structures on those properties. Thus, the resolution did not conflict with R.C. 519.20. Next, plaintiff had not waived its First Amendment claim. Although its complaint did not cite the First Amendment, it did cite the Fourteenth Amendment, and the substance of the assertions put defendants on notice of the First Amendment claim. The zoning resolution, however, did not control the communicative aspects of the billboards, but merely set reasonable set-back requirements for structures as permitted by law. It was not a content-based restriction on speech and did not implicate First Amendment concerns.</SPAN></P>

The state was justified in treating juveniles differently than adults because of its interests in preserving and promoting the child's welfare. Standard of review to be applied was the rational basis test. The court rejected appellant's contention that &sect; 2903.13 was unconstitutional because it provided an enhanced penalty where victim was police or probation officer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner sought judicial review in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) of the decisions of appellees, a city, its city council and a planning commission, which found the landowner's use of its property was not a permitted use and denied its application for a conditional use permit. The trial court upheld the decisions reviewed and enjoined the landowner's operations without a valid permit. The landowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner ran a concrete recycling business. The appellate court held the owner did not show that the use was ever a lawful one, so it was not a nonconforming use. The applicable zoning ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague as it notified the owner of land use restrictions, and the lack of definitions of prohibited &quot;scrap yards&quot; and &quot;waste material processors&quot; did not make the ordinance vague. Given noise and dust complaints about the property, the owner did not show the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to the property, as it did not show the ordinance was clearly arbitrary without substantial relation to the public health. The owner's property use was included in the ordinance. The zoning administrator's authority to find proscribed uses did not overcome the ordinance's presumed validity. Estoppel could not prevent the city from enforcing its zoning ordinances. Neither the planning commission nor the city council made a required inquiry into whether the owner met the criteria for a conditional use permit. The trial court's injunction was proper insofar as the owner was operating without a conditional use permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Insofar as the owner was currently operating without a conditional use permit, the trial court's injunction was affirmed, but the trial court's judgment affirming the owner's administrative appeal was reversed, and the matter was remanded to the trial court with directions to remand it to the planning commission to review the owner's application for a conditional use permit.</SPAN></P>

After his conviction, defendant argued that the legislature's decision to decline to afford special treatment to those aggravated murder defendants not facing death was irrational or unconstitutional on equal protection grounds. The appellate court found that defendant failed in his attempt to cast himself as a victim of Ohio's aggravated murder sentencing scheme, as opposed to a beneficiary of its protective features. Defendant failed to demonstrate, and the record failed to support, the conclusion that defendant suffered actual prejudice as a result of counsel's failure to present the testimony of certain, unidentified witnesses.

Further, it did not impermissibly draw a distinction between sovereign and private tortfeasors.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both defendants were separately indicted for multiple offenses, including aggravated murder with a death specification.

Statutory language reflecting that procedure was severed and a new protocol was ordered implemented. The State appealed, and defendants sought dismissal due to lack of a final appealable order and they also filed a cross-appeal. The court held that no final appealable order existed under art.

A magistrate recommended that the writ was to be denied. The applicant objected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant began operating a pizza restaurant franchise at a site where another business had previously operated a pizza restaurant franchise with the same franchiser. The principal of the previous franchisee was the son of the applicant's principal. After receiving the applicant's application for coverage, the BWC applied Ohio Admin. Code 4123-17-13(C) and determined that the applicant was essentially the same employer as the prior business and, instead of granting the application for coverage, the BWC concluded that the applicant already had coverage in the form of the policy already issued to the prior business. The applicant argued that the BWC, pursuant to R.C. 4123.32(C), should have applied Ohio Admin. Code 4123-17-02 and determined whether the applicant was a successor employer to the prior business. The reviewing court found that the BWC did not abuse its discretion in applying Ohio Admin. Code 4123-17-13(C) and finding that the applicant was essentially the same employer as the prior business. Moreover, Ohio Admin. Code 4123-17-13(C) was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father appealed a decision of the Butler County Juvenile Court (Ohio) finding that it did not have jurisdiction to modify a child support order issued in Oklahoma. The Butler County Child Support Enforcement Agency registered a child support order in Butler County Juvenile Court on behalf of appellee mother and the State of Oklahoma.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile court lacked jurisdiction to modify the Oklahoma support order.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3115.48(A)(1) was inapplicable, as the child and the obligee lived in Oklahoma.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3115.48(A)(2) was inapplicable because all parties had not given written consent authorizing an Ohio court to modify the order.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3115.50 was inapplicable because all of the parties who were individuals did not reside in Ohio, and the child lived Oklahoma. Under Ohio law, the juvenile court did not have jurisdiction to modify the order. The federal Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act dictated the same result, and the case did not fall within any pertinent exceptions. According to state and federal law, Oklahoma, the state that issued the order, was the only state with jurisdiction to modify the order. There was no legal authority to show that the father's equal protection and due process rights were violated. He failed to meet his burden of proving that the relevant state and federal statutes were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The PA provided the SOO's conviction and an affidavit from a county auditor that the residence was approximately 625 feet from an elementary school. The trial court granted the PA's motion, finding that the evidence supported it and that &sect; 2950.031 withstood constitutional challenge. On appeal, the court held that the PA provided sufficient evidence to support the grant of summary judgment. The method of measurement used by the auditor was not improper, and he noted that the elementary school was a &quot;school premises&quot; under R.C. 2925.01(R)(1). Constitutional challenges against former R.C. 2950.031(A) under the substantive due process clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16 lacked merit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted on three charges. He entered into an agreement with the prosecution, whereby defendant entered a guilty plea to a reduced charge of burglary in exchange for the dismissal of the remaining charges. The trial court conducted a colloquy regarding the plea and then accepted it and found defendant guilty. He was sentenced to a maximum term of imprisonment. On appeal, the court noted that as Foster was decided prior to defendant's sentencing hearing, his failure to raise that issue before the trial court could be construed as a waiver for purposes of appeal. However, even assuming that it was properly reviewable, defendant's claim that the sentence imposed violated the ex post facto clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV lacked merit. The range of prison terms before and after Foster for a third degree felony were the same. Accordingly, defendant's claim that an enlargement occurred with respect to R.C. &sect; 2929.14 or punishments generally lacked merit. There was no showing that defendant would have acted differently if he had known that parts of &sect; 2929.14 would have been severed as unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

P. 12(I), despite his no contest plea, and the court's jurisdiction was not defeated by his failure to serve the Ohio Attorney General, as he sought no declaratory relief. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.25, as applied, violated the Defense of Marriage Amendment, Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 11, because the statute recognized a legal status for cohabitants. Cohabitation, as applied to one man and one woman, who did not parent a child together, was intended to approximate the design, qualities, significance or effect of marriage. Section 2919.25 created no legal status for cohabitants, contrary to Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 11, because the statute only created a class of victims based on their relationship with the offender, but, because it included cohabitants within its definition of &quot;family or household member,&quot; thereby extending the statute's protection to cohabitants, it recognized the legal status of cohabitation, so it was unconstitutional as applied to heterosexual couples who had not mutually parented children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was reversed, and the matter was remanded with directions to dismiss the indictment. A question regarding whether Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 11 rendered Ohio Rev.

II, &sect; 28. The registration and notification provisions of R.C. Chapter 2950 did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause because its provisions served the remedial purpose of protecting the public.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded no contest in the Marion County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) to a bill of information charging him with one count of failure to provide notice of change of address in violation of R.C. 2950.05(A). The trial court found defendant guilty and sentenced him to a term of community control. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sexual offender classification stemmed from his 1996 conviction for gross sexual imposition. He argued that his ten-year registration period under the Ohio Megan's Law commenced on his release from prison and, therefore, had terminated. He further argued that R.C. 2950.07(D) (1999), which tolled the registration period for any time during which he was re-incarcerated and was effective subsequent to his conviction, did not apply retroactively; and, if it did, violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, the prohibition against ex post facto laws. He finally argued that R.C. 2950.07(D) violated his right to procedural due process. On appeal, the court found that, because R.C. 2950.07(D) was remedial in nature, it did not violate Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, and it was properly applied to defendant. In addition, because defendant was not entitled to a further hearing to challenge his initial duty to register as a sexual offender, he was not entitled to a further hearing to challenge his continued obligation to register pursuant to R.C. 2950.07(D) as that continued duty also attached as a matter of law and stemmed from his original conviction.</SPAN></P>

The evidence showed that defendant was instructed to get into her vehicle, she repeatedly exited the vehicle, and she violated the orders of the officer in doing so. As to the weight of the evidence, the trial court did not lose its way or commit a manifest miscarriage of justice in convicting defendant. Defendant did not raise an argument in the trial court that Broadview Heights, Ohio, Ordinances &sect; 404.02 was facially overbroad. There was no plain error because other similar challenges had been rejected. Also, &sect; 404.02 generally tracked the language of R.C. 4513.36. As to whether Broadview Heights, Ohio, Ordinances &sect; 404.02 was overbroad as applied, it was noted that the officer could have required defendant to remain in her vehicle while obtaining information.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in permitting the State to keep the confidential informant's (CI) identity confidential in a public trial where the informant's name was already known to the defendant. The appellate court held that the State did have a valid, reasonable foundation for keeping the CI's name confidential. By keeping his identity off the record, the police could still use him as a confidential informant for controlled drug buys in the future. Further, defense counsel agreed that concealing his identity was not a problem, so long as the CI did not deny his past criminal history. Thus, because no additional reservations were expressed by defense counsel regarding the concealment of the informant's identity, any error issuing from the concealment was invited. However, the trial court erred in failing to adhere to the statutory mandates set forth in recently amended R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) and R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(c). The trial court neither made the necessary findings for imposing consecutive sentences as required by R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) nor stated its reasons to support those findings as required by R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(c).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted him of aggravated vehicular assault (AVA), in violation of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After drinking in a bar, defendant drove through a stop sign and collided with another vehicle. Field sobriety tests were administered and defendant was arrested and given a breathalyzer test. On appeal from his conviction, the court found that although the breathalyzer results were admitted without expert testimony, such error was harmless due to defendant's admission that he was drinking and other evidence of his intoxication. Testimony from the victim as to her injuries was harmless error under Ohio R. Evid. 401 and 403(A), as there was significant other evidence of defendant's guilt. Exclusion of defendant's expert's testimony as to the reliability of the breath test generally under &sect; 4511.19(D) was not error, as testimony challenging defendant's specific test results was allowed. Constitutional challenges to the testing scheme were not preserved, although there was no plain error. As Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.08(A) was a strict liability statute, no recklessness instruction was required and sentencing instructions were proper. The mandatory sentence did not violate equal protection or constitute cruel and unusual punishment, and the conviction was supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Common Pleas of Shelby County (Ohio) granted summary judgment for defendants. Plaintiffs appealed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city rezoned lots from I-2, heavy industrial zone, to B-2, community business zone, pursuant to a planning commission recommendation to allow for a large retail store to be built. Two weeks after defendant city passed that ordinance (A-2203), plaintiffs filed a referendum petition with defendant. Defendant city's council, in an effort to bypass the referendum, adopted an emergency ordinance (A-2207) that instantly repealed the rezoning ordinance, and a few minutes later unanimously adopted an emergency ordinance (A-2208), that instantly rezoned the lots in exactly the same manner as the original ordinance had previously done, thus effectively blocking the previously filed referendum and preventing the filing of any future referendum. The process followed by defendant city in enacting A-2208 failed to follow the unambiguous language provided by the city's code of ordinances, to hold a hearing upon proper notice, and thus, was not proper. Plaintiffs established that defendant city clearly abused its corporate powers when it enacted A-2208. The appeals court declared A-2208 to be invalid and A-2207 valid as merely a revocation of A-2203.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended, in part, that his sentence was contrary to law and that it was not supported by the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred when sentencing him because it did not make any of the findings in R.C. 2929.14 and did not give the reasons in support of that finding. However, &sect; 2929.14 was found unconstitutional in Foster and severed from the statutory scheme; thus, it was not error to not include findings under &sect; 2929.14. Further, the U.S. Supreme Court's pronouncement in Oregon v. Ice did not change the outcome of the case. Since defendant failed to raise his argument in the trial court, he waived all but plain error. He could not show plain error under Civ. R. 52 as the court's prior precedent held that Ice did not resurrect &sect; 2929.14(E)(4) nor did the Ohio General Assembly's amendment of &sect; 2929.14 in 2009. Finally, the trial court did not err in failing to permit defendant to enter into a diversion program under R.C. 2935.36 as defendant was only entitled to be considered for participation in the program.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer/citizen brought his action, claiming that Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 11 was violated by the university's policy regarding provision of its medical insurance benefits to same-sex domestic partners of its employees. The university based its summary judgment motion on its claim that the taxpayer lacked standing to assert the claim. The court found that the taxpayer lacked the requisite, adverse legal interest in the dispute to maintain standing. As a taxpayer, he failed to show standing because he was not a member of a special class that had funded the particular expenditures, and he was not damaged individually and concretely. As a citizen, he failed to show that he had public-rights standing, as that was only available to those who sought extraordinary writs. The taxpayer's request for declaratory and injunctive relief was not within the type of writ subject to public-rights standing. The issue of whether tax money was used to make the payments at issue was not relevant, as no standing was found in order to reach the merits of the claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant new law repeal petitioners (NLPs) sought review of a judgment from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which denied their request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction (PI) to prohibit appellees, the Ohio Attorney General and the Ohio Secretary of State, from enforcing R.C. 3519.01(B) and 3519.05. The matter arose in an action by the NLPs, seeking repeal of Sub. H.B. 545, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2008).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After passage of H.B. 545, the NLPs filed three petitions proposing to repeal H.B. 545. Thereafter, the NLPs filed their action, seeking a declaration that &sect;&sect; 3519.01(B) and 3519.05 were unconstitutional and invalid, as well as injunctive relief. It was noted that appellees had certified the accuracy of the last petition. The trial court denied the request for temporary relief due to a lack of showing by the NLPs of a likelihood of success on the merits. On appeal, the court initially noted that &sect; 3519.01(C) was inapplicable, as a challenge had been raised to the statutory process rather than a certification decision. The court found that the General Assembly had changed and developed the process faced by those who sought to repeal a state law by referendum. Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 1g did not preclude additional requirements to the process as long as they facilitated, and did not limit or restrict, the reserved powers of referendum or initiative. Further, the time requirements in &sect; 3519.01 did not completely impede passage of a law under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 1c. Accordingly, the necessary showing of a likelihood of success on the merits for purposes of a PI was not made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the sentence imposed by the Putnam County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case arose from the death of defendant's son due to shaken-impact syndrome. Although the child endangering conviction had been initially reversed as the bill of information failed to state an essential element of the crime, defendant subsequently pleaded guilty to the same count in an amended bill of information. After the sentence was affirmed on an initial appeal, the state supreme court remanded for resentencing pursuant to Foster. The trial court imposed the same sentence, and defendant filed the instant appeal, arguing that the sentence was unconstitutional. The court affirmed, finding that the Foster holding did not violate the due process clause. The court noted that defendant was on notice of the potential penalties for his unlawful conduct as the statutory range of sentences for the felonies to which he pleaded guilty had remained unchanged. Because R.C. &sect; 1.50 allowed for the severance remedy applied in Foster, the court held that the separation of powers principle had not been violated. As the retroactive application of Foster to cases on direct review was mandated by the state supreme court, the trial court properly resentenced defendant in accordance with Foster.</SPAN></P>

The judgment was affirmed; the court found the statute constitutional, appellants were not entitled to underinsured motorist proceeds, because their policy limits were the same as those of the tort feasor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offender was found guilty of rape and other offenses.

In affirming, the appellate court determined that S.B. 10 was not unconstitutional. First, there was no separation of powers violation because reclassification did not vacate or modify a prior final judgment. The offender had no reasonable expectation of finality in the collateral consequence of his former classification. Next, there was no ex post facto violation because S.B. 10's regulatory system was not punitive in nature. Federal case law on this subject was persuasive. S.B. 10 also did not violation Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 because the statute was procedural in nature. Further, there was no double jeopardy violation under U.S. Const. amend. V or Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10 since S.B. 10 was non-punitive in nature. Finally, the offender had no standing to argue that S.B. 10 violated constitutional protections against the impairment of contracts because there was no plea agreement in this case. At any rate, sex offender registration and notification statutes did not create a contract with the offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city sought review of a judgment from the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted summary judgment to defendant, the State of Ohio, and third-party defendant firefighters union in the city's declaratory judgment action. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of R.C. 9.481 against challenge by the city, and it held that it prevailed over residency requirements adopted by the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city had a residency requirement for its employees pursuant to Dayton, Ohio, Charter &sect; 102.

Accordingly, the city brought suit to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 9.481. The trial court granted summary judgment to the State and the union, upholding the constitutionality of &sect; 9.481 and determining that it prevailed over the city's residency requirement. On appeal, the court reviewed numerous precedents on the issue. It determined that the enactment of &sect; 9.481 was authorized by the broad grant of authority to the General Assembly to provide for the general welfare of working persons under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 34. Further, such authority could not be impaired by the &quot;home rule&quot; provision of Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3 or any other provision of the Ohio Constitution. The role of the judiciary was not impermissibly interfered with by the General Assembly's enactment of R.C. 9.481, and &sect; 9.481 did not violate the Uniformity Clause of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26. As R.C. 9.481 was a general law, a claim of arbitrary classifications lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

Any possible limited exception to the general rule barring an extraordinary action in mandamus to contest the constitutionality of legislation did not apply as this was not a &quot;rare and extraordinary case&quot; in which the challenged statute operated directly and broadly to divest courts of judicial power.

The trial court subsequently conducted a hearing and determined defendant to be a sexual predator. On appeal defendant challenged the sufficiency and weight of the evidence supporting the finding of sexual predator status, the procedural aspects of his sexual predator hearing, and the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code ch. 2950. The court found the trial court's determination of sexual predator status was supported by sufficient evidence and was not against the manifest weight of the evidence, especially in the absence of any testimony suggesting defendant's likelihood to re-offend was minimal. The court was unable to find that defendant received inadequate or insufficient notice of his sexual predator hearing because defendant never raised the issue before the trial court. The court held the legislation was not unconstitutional under equal protection, due process, ex post facto, or retroactivity challenges.</SPAN></P>

Thus, he was not prejudiced by the fact that his opportunity to register in the Ohio's Putative Father Registry pursuant to former R.C. 3107.07(B)(1) and former R.C. 3107.062 did not extend up to the date that the adoption petition was filed; [2]-The father was not injured by the aspect of R.C. 3107.07(B)(1) that he alleged was unconstitutional since his argument under the erroneous-deprivation element was merely hypothetical.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cleveland, Ohio, Charter &sect; 74 imposed a residency requirement for city employees. The appellate court held R.C. 9.481 did not supersede the city's home rule authority to enforce this residency requirement because the statute was not validly enacted under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 34, as it was not economic legislation, nor did it have a nexus between its legislative end and the working environment, and upholding it would extinguish the boundaries between State power and a municipality's authority to legislate the employee-employer relationship. The statute was not a general law because it did not state police, sanitary, or similar regulations, rather than purporting only to grant or limit the city's legislative power to state police, sanitary, or similar regulations, nor did it prescribe a rule of conduct upon citizens generally. Its exemptions for &quot;volunteers&quot; and employees who had to respond to emergencies and disasters did not state police, sanitary, or similar regulations and only limited the city's legislative authority. It did not prescribe a rule of conduct upon citizens generally since it imposed a restriction on the conduct of political subdivisions, not citizens.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of an Ohio Municipal Court, which convicted her for violating city ordinances which prohibited unlawful conduct of persons at city commission meetings, disorderly conduct, and obstruction of official business, in violation of Dayton, Ohio, Revised Code General Ordinances &sect;&sect; 30.06(A)(3), 137.01(A)(2), and 131.02(A), respectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant often attended city commission meetings and spoke during the public comment portion of the meeting. However, at two such meetings, defendant refused to stop talking after her allotted three-minute comment time expired. She also refused to leave the podium, engaged in a loud verbal exchange with another speaker, and had to be escorted by police from the meeting. She was charged in two separate complaints, which were consolidated for trial. Defendant's motions in limine and for dismissal were overruled, and she was convicted and sentenced. On appeal, the court found that Dayton, Ohio, Revised Code General Ordinances &sect; 30.06(A)(3) was not void for vagueness, as a person of reasonable intelligence would understand when conduct became &quot;boisterous.&quot; Further, it was not overbroad, as the restrictions were content-neutral. Admission of evidence of defendant's conduct on prior occasions, pursuant to Ohio R. Evid. 404(B), was relevant to prove her purposeful intent for purposes of the obstructing official business charge. The offenses were not allied offenses of similar import within Ohio Rev.

Code &sect; 4123-6-02.2(B)(5).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician was convicted in the Florida federal court of one count of conspiring to defraud insurance companies by submitting false and inflated medical bills. He retained his medical licenses and maintained a family practice in Ohio since 1980. He was certified as an HPP provider and was recertified. However, after a hearing, the certification was revoked under Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4123-6-02.2(B)(5). On appeal, the trial court reversed the revocation, finding that &sect; 4123-6-02.2(B)(5), as applied to the physician, violated his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection. On further review, the court held that there was no substantive due process or equal protection violation by application of &sect; 4123-6-02.2(B)(5) to the physician, as the rule had a rational relationship to legitimate state interests. As no discretion was exercised by the OBWC in denying recertification or in interpreting Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.441, promissory estoppel was inapplicable. However, Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4123-6-02.2(B)(5) was validly implemented within the OBWC's authority. Consideration of the physician's sealed records was proper within Ohio Rev.

An amendment to &sect; 2950.05(A) changing the amount of advance notice required from seven days to 20 days did not violate the prohibition against retroactive legislation set forth in Ohio Const. art.

The appellate court held that defendant failed to establish that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.

Regardless, after Foster, the trial court was permitted to impose greater than minimum and consecutive sentences without judicial factfinding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant created writings and drawings depicting an actual child engaged in fictional sexual conduct. The appellate court held the State could prohibit the possession of such material without abridging defendant's constitutional rights because the prevention of sexual exploitation of children was a government objective of surpassing importance. His writings and drawings were harmful to the physiological, emotional, and mental health of the child. There was no requirement that such material be disseminated before defendant could be held criminally liable, as the private possession of child pornography could be constitutionally prohibited, nor did the material have to depict actual events, because the State had a compelling interest in preventing the child's exploitation. His obscene drawings and writings depicted a real child, so a bar against legislation banning child pornography which does not depict real children was not offended. Because the material depicted a real child, the State could constitutionally prohibit its creation and possession, and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.321, as applied to defendant, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

He successfully completed his probation and applied for the expungement of his records. After the completion of his probation, but prior to his application for expungement, the legislature amended the relevant statute to preclude the expungement of such crimes. The trial court held that the expungement statute was remedial in nature, and therefore the constitutional provisions against ex post facto laws did not apply. The appellate court undertook an analysis of the relevant statutes and determined that the defendant had not demonstrated that the alleged ex post facto application altered the definition of criminal conduct or increased the penalty for his crime. The appellate court concluded that the retroactive application of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.36(C) did not violate the constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto legislation and upheld the trial court's judgment which denied defendant's motion to have his records expunged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant/cross-appellee, Director of Ohio Department of Health (ODH) challenged a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Ohio that both denied ODH's request for a permanent injunction and vacated ten existing violations entered against appellees/cross-appellants, corporation and its chief executive officer, all arising under Ohio's Smoke Free Workplace Act, R.C. Chapter 3794.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court, by vacating the corporation's 10 existing violations, necessarily found some of the arguments in its request for declaratory judgment to be persuasive, and although the trial court did not expressly rule on the corporation's cross-claim against the Attorney General for permanent injunction, the trial court's decision to vacate the corporation's 10 existing violations rendered the Attorney General unable to collect any fines resulting from those violations. Because the 10 orders finding violations were final pursuant to R.C. 2505.02, the trial court should not have entertained the corporation's collateral attack on them. Therefore, the trial court erred as a matter of law in vacating the corporation's 10 existing final violations of the Smoke Free Act. The trial court erred when it denied ODH's complaint seeking a statutory injunction pursuant to R.C. 3794.09(D) against the corporation where the evidence was overwhelming that the corporation repeatedly and intentionally violated the Smoke Free Act, failed to comply with its provisions as R.C. 3794.09(D) required, and in so doing exposed patrons and employees to the very harm the statute was designed to prevent.</SPAN></P>

Chapter 2950, as amended by S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2007).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offender was convicted of gross sexual imposition and sexual battery in 1996. In December 2007, he received a notice of his new classification and registration duties. His petition contesting reclassification was overruled, and the offender challenged that decision. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the offender became subject to the provisions of S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2007) on January 1, 2008. Regardless of the status of the law prior to that date, the offender was required after that date to comply with the registration requirements of the new law. Next, the argument that S.B. 10 violated the right to protection from ex post facto laws, the right to substantive due process, the right to contract, and the right to procedural due process had been rejected previously. There was no separation of powers violation either. Regarding residency restrictions, the offender did not have standing because he did not allege or establish that he was deprived of his property rights. Even if he did have standing, his constitutional argument had been rejected previously. Finally, the offender had no vested contractual right with which the Ohio Legislature interfered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his motion to dismiss was denied, defendant pled no contest to two counts of improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.16. The Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) sentenced him to five years of community control, which contained various conditions, including the permanent forfeiture of his concealed carry license. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.16(E)(1) and (3) unnecessarily infringed upon his constitutional right to bear arms. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err by concluding that the statute was constitutional, pursuant to Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 4. Since Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.16(E)(1) and (3) placed less restrictions on the right to bear arms than the former version of the statute, which the Supreme Court of Ohio found to be constitutional, the subsections were constitutional. Further, the provisions were not vague. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.16(E)(1) clearly provided how a person with a concealed carry license could transport a loaded firearm in a motor vehicle. The language was clear and unambiguous. The statute clearly stated that the loaded firearm must be secured in a locked glove compartment. The fact that defendant's glove compartment did not lock did not make the statute void for vagueness. Nor did the statute lead to arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement because the firearm either was, or was not, secured in a manner that complied with the statute. Likewise, the statute passed a void-for-vagueness test.</SPAN></P>

The business owner had requested a de novo hearing, seeking, inter alia, review of the constitutionality of the zoning regulation.

The appellate court ruled that the issue of constitutionality of a zoning regulation was not within the scope of a zoning appeals board.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant said applying S.B. 10 violated the ban on retroactive laws. The appellate court found the Ohio Supreme Court held prior, similar, legislation did not violate this ban because it was remedial, and there was no reason to think S.B. 10 would be viewed differently. For this reason, S.B. 10 did not violate the ex post facto clause, nor did it violate the double jeopardy clauses of the Ohio and United States Constitutions, as it did not impose punishment. It did not violate appellant's right to contract, based on the State's prior representation that it would seek a minimum sex offender classification, because it was held, in response to the same argument as to prior, similar, legislation, that an offender had no reasonable expectation that his crime would not be subject to future legislation, and there was no reason to think the Ohio Supreme Court would depart from this rationale. S.B. 10 did not violate juvenile justice's history and purpose because (1) it let appellant be reevaluated, prove his rehabilitation, and have his status lowered or removed, and (2) the legislature did not intend to exempt juveniles from sex offender registration requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sex offender was convicted and sentenced for rape, and was classified as a sexual predator. After receiving a Notice of New Classification and Registration Duties under Ohio's Adam Walsh Act (Act), R.C. Chapter 2950, reclassifying him as a Tier III sex offender, he filed a petition to contest the application of the Act to him. The Lake County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) denied the petition. The offender appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offender argued that S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio) violated the constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto laws and retroactive legislation. The appellate court held that Ohio's Adam Walsh Act did not violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto legislation. The Ex Post Facto Clause did not preclude Ohio from making reasonable categorical judgments that conviction of specified crimes should entail particular regulatory consequences. Thus, S.B. 10 was not unconstitutional due to the fact that its classification system was based solely on the type of crime committed by the offender. Further, the offender failed to provide any authority indicating that he possessed a reasonable expectation of finality in his original classification. His expectation of finality was limited to his conviction and did not include his former classification. His previous classification was nothing more than a collateral consequence arising from his criminal conduct. As a result, in amending Ohio's classification scheme and making it retroactive to apply to all sex offenders, including the offender, the Ohio General Assembly did not abrogate a final judgment in favor of the offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first count of the indictment alleged that defendant violated Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 2921.13(A)(1) by knowingly making a false statement in an official proceeding, and violated &sect; 2921.13(A)(3) by knowingly making a false statement with the purpose to mislead a public official. In his motion to dismiss, defendant sought to have the first count dismissed on four grounds, and the second count dismissed pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.13(A)(1)(b) based on the running of the statute of limitations. The trial court found that defendant was asking the court to make a determination as to whether he complied with the statutory requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 311.01. Such a determination could only be made at the conclusion of the State's case in chief. Finally, since defendant was not in office on the date he filed the declaration of candidacy, the savings provision suggested by the State did not apply to toll the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, eight assignments of error were raised . The first seven challenged the constitutionality of Ohio's sexual predator laws, and the final one was a manifest weight challenge to the determination that he was a sexual predator. The court rejected the argument that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2950 was void for vagueness since it compelled a court to make a preponderance determination based upon clear and convincing evidence. The court also did not agree that the statute was an unconstitutional bill of attainder. The trial court's decision was based, in large part, on the expert testimony. Experts agreed that appellant met the qualifications of a sexual predator. Appellant's own expert offered the opinion that appellant should not be left unsupervised in areas where women were available and alone. When experts from both sides concluded that the defendant was a sexual predator, the court was hard-pressed to determine otherwise.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Court rejected appellant's arguments that sexual predator laws were unconstitutional and that appellant was not sexual predator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to witness intimidation and abduction and was sentenced. Later, the Mercer County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) sua sponte issued a nunc pro tunc judgment entry to notify him about post-release control. The sentence was reversed in part. On remand, the trial court held a hearing and notified defendant that he was subject to post-release control and resentenced him to the original sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that imposing post-release control at a later date violated finality of sentencing and double jeopardy principles. The appellate court held that, because he raised identical arguments in his first appeal, he was barred by the doctrine of res judicata from raising the arguments again. Regardless, under both R.C. 2929.191 and judicial precedent, the trial court had the authority to conduct the resentencing hearing to impose post-release control and to issue its subsequent corrective entry, since defendant's prison term had not yet expired. Further, applying Foster on a remand for resentencing did not violate due process. The statutory sentencing range for third-degree felonies had not changed under R.C. 2929.14(A)(3) and the presumption of vindictiveness principles regarding increased sentences still applied. Additionally, the trial court did conduct a new, complete resentencing hearing pursuant to R.C. 2929.191(C) before issuing its corrective judgment entry. Thus, the trial court complied with R.C. 2929.191(C). Finally, R.C. 2929.191 did not violate the one-subject rule since all of the issues in the bill dealt with criminal justice matters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for fraudulent acts concerning vehicle identification numbers and receiving stolen property based on an administrative warrantless search of his towing and salvage company. The State appealed the finding by the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) that Cleveland, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 601.15 was unconstitutional and, therefore, suppressed all the evidence confiscated by the police.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police entered defendant's property and conducted a warrantless search of the salvage yard under the authority of Cleveland, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 601.15. The police found several vehicles and parts with missing vehicle identification numbers. The appellate court had already determined an earlier version of &sect; 601.15 was constitutional. That version was substantially similar except the new ordinance included &quot;motor vehicle parts&quot; as included in the search. Thus, the appellate court had already determined that adequate limitations were placed on the time, place, and scope of the inspection. Although the trial court found it was not bound by the appellate court's decision, it was indeed bound by that earlier decision. The trial court also found the ordinance unconstitutional because it permitted searches that were not based on probable cause. However, it ignored the United States Supreme Court precedent establishing the policy that closely regulated industries had reduced protection from the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The terminated employee worked for the employer as a securities representative.

Code Ann. &sect; 4112.02(N). It also alleged that, as to the libel claim, the terminated employee had signed a release regarding any claims arising from the filing of the form. The trial court granted the employer's motion to dismiss as to both claims. On appeal, the appellate court found her age discrimination claim was not timely filed and that the statute did not deny her equal protection, as it was rationally related to a legitimate state interest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Summit County Court of Common Pleas, Ohio, held that Akron, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 150.12 was unconstitutional for lack of a sufficient reasonable notice requirement. Appellant, the City of Akron Department of Public Health, Housing Division (City), sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its appeal, the City first challenged the jurisdiction of the common pleas court. But, the appeals court was unwilling to conclude from an informal certification that a notice of appeal was never filed with the Housing Appeals Board and included in its administrative record. The City bore the burden of affirmatively demonstrating error on appeal. With no affirmative showing that the citizen failed to file a notice of appeal with the Board, the City's argument failed. But, the appeals court agreed that the common pleas court erred when it found that Akron, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 150.12(B) violated due process requirements and was therefore unconstitutional. The citizen had actual notice of the violations, evidenced by the fact that he timely appealed the violations and condemnation order to the Board, which granted him a hearing. While he may not have been personally served with the notice of the violations or of the condemnation award, he had actual notice of them and admitted that he received them. As to the citizen's cross-appeal, there was no violation of his due process rights because he received actual notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parents sued defendants school district, gym teacher, and principal alleging survivorship, and wrongful death claims. The parents amended their complaint and sought a declaration that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744 et seq. was unconstitutional. The Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) denied the parents' motion for summary judgment, and granted summary judgment for defendants on all claims. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During gym class, the 14-year-old son suffered an asthma attack and asked the teacher if he could retrieve his inhaler from his locker. Five to 10 minutes later, a different teacher found the son on the floor of the locker room, unconscious and not breathing. He never regained consciousness. The appellate court held that there was no precedent that held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744 et seq., the immunity statute, was unconstitutional. However, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.02(B)(4) provided an exception to immunity for negligence occurring on school grounds. Further, there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the principal or the gym teacher were negligent. While the school board was entitled to immunity under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.03(A)(5) for its discretionary decisions such as the level of medical staffing and training of staff, there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendants were entitled to immunity under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.03(A)(3). Finally, the parents did fail to present evidence sufficient to create an issue of material fact as to whether the gym teacher or the principal were reckless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed with respect to: whether the statute provided an exception to immunity for negligence occurring on school grounds; the finding that the teacher and the principal were not negligent; and whether the employees of the school board were negligent. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Stark County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) held that the Massillon Electrical Code, Massillon, Ohio, Codified Ordinance ch. 1313, was constitutional. Plaintiff construction employment agency appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agency challenged the judgment entered, arguing primarily that the current electrical code violated Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3. The appeals court agreed, in part. While appellee city conceded that the electrical code was an exercise of police power and that the state statutes in question, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 4740 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 715.27, were general laws, the question remained whether the electrical code was in conflict with the general laws. First, the appeals court found that the electrical code attempted to regulate who could do the electrical work and in so doing, created unconstitutional conflicts with the general laws of Ohio. Second, the city exceeded its home rule authority in enacting Massillon, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 1313.03(g) to the extent that &sect; 1313.03(g) required licensed or registered electricians to be on the payroll of the electrical contractor. Further, the appeals court held that imposition of joint and several liability on the agency was a non-justiciable issue, as it had not sued, nor had any entity sought to hold it jointly and severally liable, for the work been sued. Pursuant to this holding, the remaining two assignments were moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant public bar challenged a decision from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Ohio, which affirmed appellee health district's decision that the Ohio Smokefree Act, R.C. Chapter 3794, had been violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The health district sent inspectors to the public bar to check for violations of the Act. A letter sent to the public bar notified it of an observed smoking violation, but omitted any mention of missing signage. The health district later sent a letter of warning based on two violations. The trial court upheld the health district's determinations, and this appeal followed. In partially affirming, the appellate court found that the actions of the health district were inappropriate with respect to the alleged sign violation. There was no opportunity for the public bar to avail itself of the limited procedure afforded to first-time violators. Next, the procedure set forth in Ohio Admin. Code 3701-52-08(D) was commensurate with the nature of the violation and the severity of the penalty, a simple warning letter. The Act did not violate constitutional guarantees to substantive due process and equal protection. The Act was also not unconstitutionally void for vagueness. As the term &quot;permit&quot; was commonly defined, the ban clearly prohibited a proprietor from allowing, consenting, or expressly assenting to smoking within an establishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the decision relating to a violation for failure to post &quot;no smoking&quot; signs on the premises was reversed. On remand, the health district was instructed to rescind the prior warning letter and to modify its finding and warning letter to reflect that the public bar only permitted smoking on the premises. The rest of the decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his sentence imposed by the Muskingum County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio). Defendant was resentenced under Foster to one year in prison for receiving stolen property and five years in prison for failing to comply with the order or signal of a police officer; the terms were to be served consecutively. That sentence was the same as what had been imposed originally.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's conviction and sentence had been affirmed on direct appeal and defendant's motion for post-conviction relief had been denied, defendant filed a federal habeas petition; the federal district court vacated defendant's sentence and ordered that he be resentenced under Blakely and Foster. The trial court resentenced defendant to the same aggregate six-year prison sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed. Based on existing precedent, defendant's resentencing under Foster did not violate his rights to a trial by jury or due process or violate the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution. Foster also gave the trial court discretion to impose consecutive sentences within the statutory range without being required to make findings or give its reasons for doing so. The rule of lenity in R.C. 2901.04(A) did not apply because Foster had clearly and unambiguously severed the unconstitutional portions of the relevant statutes.</SPAN></P>

The Lorain County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granted summary judgment for the Ohio Department of Agriculture and the Lorain County General Health District. Appellants filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that the company was not constitute a retail food establishment required to be licensed. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err in finding that R.C. 3717.21 required the company to be licensed as a retail food establishment. Even though a membership was required, because the company was a premises where food was stored, processed, prepared, manufactured, or otherwise held or handled for sale to a person who was the ultimate consumer, it was a retail food establishment subject to the licensing requirement of R.C. 3717.21. Although members ordered their products before appellants purchased them, appellants nonetheless gave those products to members in exchange for money and they made a profit well in excess of the cost of transporting and storing the food. Further, appellants did not show any due process violation under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The legislature could have reasonably found that food safety bore a substantial relationship to the public health and that regulation of the company and similar types of operations would improve food safety and, consequently, the public health. Finally, there was no equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

Chapter 2950, the inmate was notified that he was reclassified as a &quot;Tier III offender.&quot; The inmate contested the reclassification, and a hearing was conducted thereon. The trial court found that certain provisions of the AWA with respect to community notification and additional registration requirements were unconstitutional as to the inmate. It upheld the provisions of the AWA regarding increased frequency and duration of the registration requirements. The matter was stayed on appeal pending an Ohio Supreme Court decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a township legal officer, sought to enjoin appellant sexually oriented offender from continuing to occupy the offender's residence, under former R.C. 2950.031, now R.C. 2950.034. The trial court granted the requested injunction, and the First District Court of Appeals (Ohio) affirmed. The offender sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the offender was found to be a sexually oriented offender, the legislature passed former R.C. 2950.031, barring certain sex offenders from living within 1,000 feet of a school, which the trial court applied retroactively to the offender. The supreme court held R.C. 1.48 presumed the statute was prospective unless it &quot;clearly proclaimed&quot; a retroactive application. Neither the statute's description of convicted sex offenders nor its description of prohibited acts clearly declared a retroactive intent. Ambiguous language regarding prospective or retroactive application did not rebut the prospective presumption. The use of a form of the past tense did not show retroactivity, nor did a description of prohibited acts in the present tense purport to cover similar past acts, and two verbs in the description of prohibited acts could reasonably denote distinct, present-tense meanings. A claim that R.C. Chapter 2950 as a whole applied retroactively, making it unnecessary to expressly state a retroactive intent unless otherwise stated, was rejected since R.C. 1.48 did not require a statute's prospective nature to be stated.</SPAN></P>

Defendant moved to dismiss, arguing that the statute's punishment of homosexual, and not heterosexual, activity violated his right to equal protection of the laws, established in U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ohio Const. art. 1, &sect; 2. Heterosexual propositions, argued defendant, could be just as vulgar and offensive and just as likely to invite violence as homosexual propositions. Thus, argued defendant, the statute was not rationally related to a legitimate state interest. The court found defendant's argument persuasive, and invited the state supreme court to review the issue, but based on prior precedent, the court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offender entered into a plea agreement relating to several crimes. He was required to register as a sexually oriented offender, due to a violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(4), for a period of 10 years. The offender was released, but was later placed back in custody when his shock probation was revoked. While imprisoned, the offender received a notice of a new classification and registration duties. The offender's motion to contest the reclassification was denied, and this appeal followed. In reversing, the appellate court determined that R.C. 2950.031 and R.C. 2950.032, which required the Ohio Attorney General to reclassify sex offenders whose classifications had already been adjudicated by a court and made the subject of a final order, violated the separation of powers doctrine. These provisions were severed from the Adam Walsh Act, S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2007), and were no longer enforceable. Therefore, the offender's reclassification was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant violated his post-release control and was prosecuted for escape under Ohio Rev.

Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the application of the escape statute to him, under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 9, which contained a prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment identical to the one at U.S. Const. amend. VIII, and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 1, which generally guaranteed liberty and privacy. The court followed guidelines used in construing the federal cruel and unusual punishment provision, and determined that defendant's punishment was not shockingly disproportionate to his offense. It then determined that this limitation on defendant's liberty was a reasonable exercise of the police power, preventing escapes from lawful detention by the least restrictive means feasible. The choice to charge with escape was within prosecutorial discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, because the penalty was not so greatly disproportionate to the offense as to shock the sense of justice of the community and because the escape statute was a reasonable exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child received injuries consistent with &quot;shaken baby syndrome&quot; while in foster care. Summary judgment was granted in favor of the LCDJFS and the employees, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court rejected the argument that R.C. Chapter 2744 violated the right to a trial by jury under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 5. Next, no argument was presented to support a claim that confidential information was released, in violation of R.C. 5153 and Ohio Admin. Code 5101:2-34-38. A loss of consortium claim was abandoned. Because no exceptions to immunity applied under R.C. 2744.02(B)(1)-(5), the LCDJFS was immune from liability. Reliance on R.C. 2744.03(A)(5) was misplaced because it did not provide an independent basis of liability. Further, employees of the LCDJFS were immune from liability under R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(b) because there was no evidence of recklessness. Ohio Admin. Code 5101:2-42-05(B) or Ohio Admin. Code 5101:2-42-05(E) had not been violated. Also, there was no showing of an awareness that one of the foster parents had been fired from his job due to anger issues. Finally, it was typical and appropriate for new foster parents to require further training.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the remedy in Foster violated the Due Process and Ex Post Facto Clauses of the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from the trial court's judgment resentencing him pursuant to Foster, defendant contended that his sentence was unconstitutional because the remedy in Foster violated the due process and ex post facto provisions of the U.S. and Ohio Constitutions. The court rejected this argument, noting that it had repeatedly held that Foster's remedy did not violate these constitutional provisions. Defendant's claim that the trial court could not impose greater than the minimum and consecutive sentences was without merit. Following Foster, defendant's current sentence was entirely supported by the jury's finding of guilt. The court determined that, since defendant was aware of the potential sentence at the time that he committed his crime and since the remedial holding of Foster was not unexpected, Foster did not violate due process notions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant auto owner filed a putative class action against appellees, a city and traffic enforcement camera company, asserting an unjust enrichment claim and challenging the constitutionality of a city ordinance. Appellees filed a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim for which relief could be granted. The Lucas County, Ohio, Court of Common Pleas, granted the motion and dismissed the case; appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company maintained a system that took pictures of vehicles that went through red lights and measured vehicle speed. Appellant alleged that appellees shared revenues generated from auto owners who were sent a civil notice of liability after being photographed during a red light or speed violation. Appellant received a such notice and paid a civil penalty. The appellate court held that as an administrative agency had no authority to determine an ordinance's constitutionality, appellant had not been required to exhaust his administrative remedies before filing suit. By enacting an ordinance that set up a civil enforcement system for red light and speeding camera system violations, the city attempted to divest the municipal court of some or all of its jurisdiction by establishing an administrative alternative without the legislature's express approval; it thereby violated Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 1, and the ordinance was therefore void. Appellant's claim that the city police never established an administrative appeal process should not have been dismissed; as due process required notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard, the absence of any process was problematic.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the amendment of R.C. 2929.14 effective April 7, 2009, did not operate to reenact those portions of the statute that the Ohio Supreme Court severed in its Foster decision. Further, defendant did not demonstrate that given his past failure to turn his life around following an earlier trafficking conviction and his admission that he kept returning to a drug trafficking lifestyle because he could not find a job, the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing defendant to consecutive terms and to the maximum term on one of the four charges. Defendant had a prior conviction for trafficking in drugs in 2005 and admitted that he &quot;worked the program&quot; following his conviction but returned to selling drugs because he could not get a job. Although defendant claimed he could not get a job because he was a convicted felon, he admitted that he did not have a job prior to his first conviction. The trial court further noted that defendant had a loaded weapon at the time of his arrest.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of the escape statute, and he entered a no contest plea to the charge. The trial court found him guilty and sentenced him, and defendant sought review. The court found that &sect; 2921.34 did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VIII, as the sentence imposed on defendant, which was the minimum available sentence for the sentencing range, was not grossly disproportionate to his offense. Further, the stiffening of punishments available for committing escape furthered the Ohio General Assembly's intent to deter such conduct. There was also no equal protection violation under U.S. Const. amend. XVIII and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2, as the graduated penalty scale was rationally related to the State's interest in protecting the public. There was a reasonable assumption that the public faced a greater risk from those individuals who committed more serious offenses.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held the argument's analysis had to ask what rights and liabilities attached to the parties' relationship by virtue of the statute and if they approximated marriage. Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 11 only barred recognizing a &quot;legal status&quot; approximating marriage. The statute created a legal status for cohabitants, and the Marriage Amendment's phrase &quot;intends to approximate. . . marriage&quot; modified &quot;legal status,&quot; not &quot;relationships of unmarried individuals,&quot; so a legal status could not approximate the design of marriage. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.25 gave domestic violence victims and perpetrators a legal status, but the Marriage Amendment only barred a legal status approximating marriage. The statute conferred rights and liabilities on relationships resembling marriage, but only recognized that people lived together as if married, and did not intend to approximate marriage, nor did the legal status it conferred approximate marriage in fact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant City appealed a decision of the Warren County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) finding unconstitutional the City's ordinance requiring that all newly-constructed commercial and residential units be connected to the City's broadband telecommunications system. Appellee homebuilders cross-appealed from findings that they could not maintain their taxpayer suit under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 733.56 and 733.59 or their 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City argued that the mandatory connection portion of Lebanon, Ohio, Codified Ordinances &sect; 916.02(16) was not an unconstitutional taking. The appellate court held that the homebuilders did not consent to the taking by agreeing to abide by the electric department's rules. The City was not using its telecommunications system in connection with the supply of electricity. While the City might use the system in connection with the supply of electricity in the future, such use was uncertain. The telecommunications fee portion of &sect; 916.02(16) was severable from the mandatory connection portion. Under &sect; 916.02(16) minus the severed portion, the City could only collect the fee from those units that requested connection to the system. The homebuilders' 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&nbsp;1983 action failed as they had an adequate state law remedy. The homebuilders were not entitled to attorney fees. Finally, the homebuilders lacked standing to bring a taxpayer action as the interests pursued by the homebuilders were primarily related to a narrow class of taxpayers, those engaging in new construction within the City. Thus, the homebuilders were not entitled to attorney fees under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 733.61.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with OVI. Under R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(d), OVI was a fourth-degree felony if appellant had been convicted of or pled guilty to five OVIs in 20 years. Appellant argued that a prior juvenile adjudication was improperly considered as a prior conviction for purposes of R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(d). In affirming, the supreme court determined that R.C. 2901.08 was not retrospective because it had no effect until a new OVI offense occurred. R.C. 2901.08 did not run afoul of either R.C. 1.48 or Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. Moreover, R.C. 2901.08 was not unconstitutionally retroactive. Appellant here was not being punished for a previous juvenile adjudication; rather, he was being punished for his current offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Youngstown Municipal Court of Mahoning County (Ohio) convicted defendant of violating the former Youngstown, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 539.07(b)(1) by playing loud and disturbing music from his vehicle. Defendant appealed, arguing that &sect; 539.07(b)(1) was unconstitutionally vague, overbroad under the Fourteenth Amendment, and violated the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court, in affirming, compared the language of &sect; 539.07(b)(1) (prohibiting maintenance of an audio system in a motor vehicle at such volume as to disturb the quiet, comfort, or repose of other persons or at a volume which was plainly audible to persons other than the occupants of that vehicle) with language of another city's ordinance (prohibiting disturbance of the peace and quiet), to decide that &sect; 539.07(b)(1) was constitutionally sound. The other city's ordinance was interpreted to prohibit the playing of music and amplification of sound in a manner which could be anticipated to offend the reasonable person--the individual of common sensibilities--in such basic human activities as conversation or sleep. That standard of construction, which did not impose criminal liability for conduct that disturbed only hypersensitive persons, vitiated the claimed vagueness of the ordinance. Both ordinances' standards were sufficiently clear to withstand a void for vagueness challenge. Section 539.07(b)(1) was not unconstitutionally overbroad. Defendant could still exercise his First Amendment rights without disturbing other persons' rights to be free from unwelcome noise.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate appealed from a summary judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) in favor of defendant officials--the warden, the corrections department director, and the state attorney general, challenging the officials' power to pursue collection of a judgment entered against him in a lawsuit on behalf of the state victims' fund by garnishment of his prison earnings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the attorney general, on behalf of Ohio's victims' fund, obtained a judgment against the inmate, the officials commenced garnishment proceedings pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5120.133. The appellate court reviewed his constitutional challenges on the merits, after determining that the inmate's failure to comply with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2969.25(A) by listing his prior civil actions did not preclude his action where he was represented by counsel. It held that the garnishment statute did not violate federal or state due process, equal protection, separation of powers, or retroactivity provisions. The inmate was hoping to recover damages in a federal personal injury lawsuit, and argued that a provision in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2329.66 excluding prisoners from a garnishment exemption for personal injury damages was unconstitutional as to him. The appellate court found arguable merit in this claim, but held that it would not be ripe for review until he was awarded damages and garnishment was attempted. The argument that the inmate had failed to exhaust his remedies was meritless, but did not affect his outcome. Finally, the attorney general was not a necessary party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the court sustained two of the inmate's assignments of error, it nonetheless affirmed the summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the offender's petition after determining that the reclassification was correct and rejecting the offender's constitutional challenges. This appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that, even assuming that certain provisions of the Ohio sex offender laws were repealed between July 2007 and January 1, 2008, the offender became subject to the provisions of S.B. 10 effective on that latter date. Further, all of the offender's constitutional challenges to S.B. 10 had been previously rejected. Further, the Ohio Legislature did not violate the separation of powers doctrine by enacting S.B. 10, and there was no procedural due process violation because a convicted felon did not have a reasonable expectation that his criminal conduct would not have been subject to further legislation. Finally, the offender lacked standing to argue that his substantive due process rights were violated by the residency restrictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile sought review of a judgment from the Wyandot County Common Pleas Court, Juvenile Division (Ohio), which designated him as a juvenile sex offender (JSO) after a sexual offender designation hearing was held. He had admitted to gross sexual imposition, in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(4) and 2152.02(F).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with being a delinquent child and he entered an admission to the charge. After a disposition hearing, a term of commitment was imposed, and defendant was designated as a Tier II sex offender. After two sets of appeals, a new sexual offender designation hearing was held, whereupon defendant was designated as a JSO. It was noted that at the time of the hearing, defendant was already 20 years old and had completed his disposition. On appeal, the court found that the juvenile court had jurisdiction to classify defendant, as it was correcting a dispositional error following a remand from the Supreme Court of Ohio. Further, there was no error under S.Ct.Prac.R. 11.1. and 11.4 by the juvenile court classifying defendant as a JSO after the effective date of the Supreme Court's judgment entry but before it was mandated to do so. Under the rational basis review, the version of R.C. 2152.83 in effect prior to S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio) did not violate defendant's equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2, as the age classification scheme bore a rational relationship to a legitimate government interest of protecting the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Originally, defendant pled guilty to sexual battery and was placed on probation. Six months later, he raped a 16-year-old girl. He pled guilty to two counts of rape, and he was sentenced to eight to 25 years on each count, to run concurrently. Subsequently, following a hearing, the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) classified defendant as a sexual predator, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2950. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the recently amended version of Megan's Law, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(D), should have been declared an unconstitutional ex post facto law. The appellate court declined to address the retroactive issue, finding that the statute had been declared non-punitive and constitutional. Further, sufficient evidence supported the trial court's classification of defendant as a sexual predator. The hearing transcript indicated that the trial court engaged in the requisite discussion and consideration. The fact that defendant raped two women in two separate offenses was relevant in finding his conduct exhibited a pattern. The first rape occurred just months after he was on probation for the first sexual offense. He also used weapons, displayed cruelty, and made threats of cruelty in both incidents. Additionally, the trial court considered the fact that defendant took many years to take and/or pass sexual offender classes and that defendant had committed numerous infractions during his first four years of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to two counts of sexual battery. The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) sentenced him to four years in prison on each count, to be served consecutively, and classified him as a Tier III sex offender with lifetime registration duties. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by sentencing him to a prison term greater than that of his codefendant. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err when it sentenced defendant. The record precluded sufficient comparison between defendant and his codefendant. The record did not specify the charges to which the codefendant pled guilty and his criminal record was not known. Thus, the sentences could not be compared. The trial court stated in its sentencing entry that it considered the purposes and principles of sentencing set forth in R.C. 2929.11 and the factors set forth in R.C. 2929.12. In addition, it weighed the factors as set forth in the applicable provisions of R.C. 2929.13 and R.C. 2929.14. That statement established that the trial court satisfied the consistency requirement in R.C. 2929.11(B). Further, the record supported the sentence. Defendant had two prior juvenile adjudications and nine prior adult convictions, and he had not been amenable to previous sanctions. His criminal record spanned almost 30 years at the time of sentencing, he had one probation revocation, and he was on community control when he committed the sex offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees challenged the judgment entered, first contending that with the implementation of Am. Sub.

However, the legislature's intent was for the amended bill to have effect for a prescribed two-year period of time, temporarily giving the Department's Director the power to transfer and/or reassign employees without seeking approval of the Director of the Department of Administrative Services. Second, they failed to satisfy the elements for an injunction, specifically that they were likely to succeed on the merits, would suffer irreparable harm if it were not granted, and that the public interest would be served by the injunction. Finally, the amended bill provided for the administration of the civil service, albeit in a different format than before. However, this varying format in and of itself did not violate the Ohio Constitution, but comported with the principles of Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bail bondsman was charged with violating violated R.C. 3905.932 and Ohio Admin. Code 3901-1-66 for soliciting on the grounds of a detention facility or court. She challenged a judgment of the Clermont County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which affirmed the decision of appellee, the Ohio Department of Insurance, to revoke her surety bail bond license and to impose a fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bondsman argued that R.C. 3905.932 was an unconstitutional prohibition on commercial free speech and was unconstitutionally vague. The court of appeals held that R.C. 3905.932 was reasonably well tailored to achieve its desired objectives. The State's interest in an effective, uninterrupted judicial process was a substantial one. The State successfully asserted a substantial interest in protecting the public from the unwanted intrusions associated with solicitation. A diverse array of witnesses provided detailed anecdotal evidence of the coercive and disruptive nature of solicitation in courthouses and detention facilities. The ban on bail bond solicitation in courts and detention centers targeted several concrete, non-speculative harms and alleviated those harms to a material degree. R.C. 3905.932 was not unconstitutionally vague for failing to provide a more precise definition of the term &quot;solicit.&quot; It gave people of ordinary intelligence fair notice and sufficient guidance to conform their conduct to the law. Not only did Ohio Admin. Code 3901-1-66(I)(1) specify additional prohibited behavior, but it also listed activities that remained permissible on court grounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, companies involved with asbestos, sought review of decisions from the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which allowed claims by appellees, 109 asbestos-related injury sufferers (ISs), to move forward upon finding that each IS had submitted sufficient evidence to show a prima-facie case in compliance with the requirements of R.C. Chapter 2307 and Am. Sub. H.B. 292, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2004).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ISs filed 10 cases involving asbestos-related claims against numerous companies. In separate decisions, the trial court determined that there was sufficient evidence to allow the claims to move forward. The decisions were implicitly based on the trial court's prior conclusion that application of new definitional requirements under H.B. 292 to the claims was an unconstitutional retroactive application. Accordingly, the trial court applied the common law standard to the claims. On appeal, the court initially found that the decisions by the trial court were final and appealable as provisional remedies under R.C. 2505.02(A)(3). It disagreed with the trial court's ruling. Rather, it noted that the Ohio Supreme Court had determined that the threshold evidentiary requirements of R.C. 2307.91, 2307.92, and 2307.93, arising from H.B. 292, did not offend the retroactivity clause of the Ohio Constitution when applied to cases pending on the effective date. Accordingly, the trial court should have applied those statutory provisions. The ISs' submissions of one-page forms that were completed by doctors who read their chest x-rays were insufficient to establish the prima-facie cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decisions of the trial court and remanded the matter with instructions to the trial court to administratively dismiss the claims. The dismissals were without prejudice and the trial court retained jurisdiction to reinstate the claims upon a proper prima facie showing.</SPAN></P>

The individuals also lacked standing under the enforcement of public right doctrine as they did not seek to enforce a current public duty and failed to show that H.B. 329 divested the courts of judicial power. H.B. 329 was not comparable to Am. Sub. H.B. 350, Gen. Assem. (Ohio).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant rental property owners filed motions to dismiss their violations of Athens, Ohio, City Code 29.03.08.1, based upon a number of arguments, including claims that the ordinance violated their constitutional right to privacy, equal protection, and due process. After the Athens County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) denied the motions, the owners pled no contest to the charges. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners challenged the constitutionality of Athens, Ohio, City Code 29.03.08.1. The appellate court held that the ordinance did not violate equal protection under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2 because the city had a rational basis for distinguishing between off-campus rental properties and on campus dormitories when it enacted Athens, Ohio, City Code 29.03.08.1. It was logical for the city to focus an educational program intended to increase compliance with city ordinances on off-campus rental properties on the people who actually lived on, and therefore likely spent the most time on, those properties. Further, Athens, Ohio, City Code 29.03.08.1 did not violate their constitutional right to privacy because nothing in the ordinance impressed a duty on a landlord to investigate or spy on his tenants. Instead, the landlord was to disclose information he already had about his tenants in the process of verifying that he had given those tenants the required educational information. Regardless, the owners lacked standing to assert their tenants' privacy rights because they failed to show any hindrance to their tenants' ability to protect their own privacy interests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, motel owners and operators, sought review of a judgment from the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) denying their requested injunction against appellee, City of Fairview and contending that two ordinances affecting the operation of their businesses were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee City of Fairview Park, with the express intention of prohibiting the use of hotels and motels by permanent guests for which such hotels and motels were not designed, enacted two ordinances. Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment finding the ordinances unconstitutional and requesting a temporary injunction against its provisions. The court found action rested upon the flawed proposition that the ordinances prohibited a duly licensed motel from operating as a temporary residence facility under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3731.01(A)(2). The plain language of the ordinances did not prohibit such conduct. The ordinances did not prohibit a &quot;relocating&quot; or &quot;temporary work&quot; guest from occupying, for 30 or more days, a facility which was &quot;specifically constructed&quot; and licensed to provide a temporary residence under that statute. Therefore, because these ordinances did not prohibit what was otherwise allowed they did not conflict with the general state law in the manner challenged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because plain language of challenged ordinances did not conflict with state statute, but modified because the &quot;reasonable relationship&quot; standard of constitutional review did not apply, rather, the &quot;conflict&quot; standard applied to the constitutional challenge asserted here.</SPAN></P>

Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing consecutive sentences because it gave careful and substantial deliberation to the relevant statutory considerations. Because Ohio's former consecutive-sentencing statutory provisions, R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) and R.C. 2929.41(A) had not been revived, no findings were required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a tire corporation and others named in 39,000 asbestos-related personal injury cases, filed motions to administratively dismiss certain pending actions. Appellee claimants claimed that retroactive application of the filing requirements under R.C. 2307.92 violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The trial court agreed. The Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio) dismissed the appeal by appellants for lack of a final appealable order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue presented was whether the court of appeals correctly dismissed, for lack of a final appealable order, an appeal from a finding by the trial court, rendered pursuant to R.C. 2307.93(A)(3), on the constitutionality of retroactively applying certain statutory provisions. The state supreme court held that the appellate court erred by dismissing the appeal because the trial court rendered a final appealable order, pursuant to R.C. 2505.02(B)(4). The trial court's finding was a provisional remedy pursuant to R.C. 2505.02(A)(3), which determined the action and prevented a judgment with respect to the provisional remedy, and the aggrieved parties would have been unable to obtain a meaningful or effective remedy upon appeal from a final judgment. The trial court's order denied appellants' motion to apply the prima facie filing requirements in R.C. 2307.92, which was enacted with the intent to give priority to asbestos claimants who could demonstrate actual physical harm or illness caused by exposure to asbestos and to enable courts to administratively dismiss the claims of claimants who could not present prima facie evidence of an impairment caused by exposure to asbestos.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the appellate court was reversed and the matter was remanded for the appellate court to review appellants' assignments of error.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held it was unnecessary to clarify that mandatory prison only applied to the rape conviction because the corrected entry's statement that prison was mandatory accurately stated the law. The corrected entry did not say prison was mandatory for felonious assault, nor that both of defendant's prison terms were mandatory. Retroactively applying Foster to defendant's sentence did not violate due process or the ex post facto clause. Foster's severance of unconstitutional sentencing statutes did not raise his presumptive minimum sentence or create an unanticipated remedy by erasing a presumption of minimum and concurrent sentences, because there was no such irrebuttable presumption before Foster. His failure to raise Foster at trial waived the issue on appeal. In addition, defendant knew the statutory sentencing range when he committed his crimes, and Foster did not judicially increase that range or retroactively apply a new statutory maximum to an earlier committed crime. Thus, Foster did not violate due process, or the ex post facto principles therein.</SPAN></P>

He agreed to pay restitution to the victims in both cases but demanded a hearing. The Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) sentenced him to two years in prison and ordered him to pay $1,780 and $750in restitution. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred because it issued a restitution order without competent and credible evidence of economic harm. The appellate court held that the trial court's restitution order was not an abuse of discretion because the trial court complied with R.C. 2929.18(A)(1) and held a restitution hearing when defendant disputed the amount. The State offered the receipts that were submitted by the victims to the probation department indicating the amounts of their respective economic harm. In opposition, defendant continued a generalized objection and did not present any evidence that would refute the amounts suggested by the victims, such as contrary estimates. Further, the trial court was not required to make any statutory findings as a prerequisite to imposing consecutive sentences. Ohio's former consecutive-sentencing statutory provisions, R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) and R.C. 2929.41(A), which were held unconstitutional in Foster, had not been revived.</SPAN></P>

II, &sect; 34 and, therefore, suspended the city's residency requirement for its public employees set forth in Warren, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 155.05.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 155.05 required, as a condition of employment, that any person appointed as a non-elected official or city employee become a resident of the city and remain a resident throughout the time of the individual's employment. The Ohio General Assembly later enacted &sect; 9.481, which prohibited municipalities from imposing a residency requirement as a condition of employment. The court held that &sect; 9.481 was constitutionally enacted under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 34 since an employee's residency was a matter within the terms or conditions of employment subject to collective bargaining. Thus, in accordance with the Supremacy Clause, &sect; 9.481 prevailed over &sect; 155.05. The court's determination that &sect; 9.481 was constitutionally enacted pursuant to the Supremacy Clause in &sect; 34 rendered unnecessary a &quot;home-rule analysis.&quot; However, even after undertaking that analysis, the court concluded that a residency requirement was not purely local in nature and was, therefore, more appropriate for a statewide control by the legislature pursuant to the doctrine of statewide concern; thus, &sect; 155.05 had to yield to &sect; 9.481. Finally, &sect; 9.481 did not violate the Ohio Constitution's Uniformity Clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Youngstown Municipal Court (Ohio), which imposed a maximum sentence of incarceration on him pursuant to R.C. &sect; 2929.22(C) after he was convicted of receiving stolen property as a first degree misdemeanor, in violation of R.C. &sect; 2913.51.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charge against defendant arose from a stolen motor vehicle that he was seen exiting. Defendant entered into a plea agreement whereby the charge against him was amended to a first degree misdemeanor and he entered a no contest plea. At his sentencing hearing, the judge indicated his annoyance at being lied to by defendant's failure to admit his presence in the car, and a maximum term of incarceration was imposed under R.C. &sect; 2929.22(C). On appeal, the court found that the trial court's sentence was not based on the statutory considerations. However, pursuant to Foster, reversal on that ground was not mandated. Rather, the court concluded that a jury trial right existed for defendant's conviction, which was a petty offense under R.C. &sect; 2929.24(A)(1) where there was a potential penalty of incarceration. Such right was provided by Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;&sect;&nbsp;5 and 10, although U.S. Const. amend. VI only applied to serious offenses. Accordingly, applying the reasoning used in Foster to defendant's situation, the court held that the judicial fact-finding required of R.C. &sect; 2929.22(C) for imposition of a maximum sentence violated the jury trial right. The sentencing provision was severed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court with respect to the sentence imposed, and the matter was remanded for resentencing where judicial fact-finding was not to be utilized when considering the proper sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate petitioned the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) for postconviction relief after being convicted of tampering with records, tampering with evidence, falsification, forgery, 10 counts of theft, and engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, and sentenced to 18 years in prison. The trial court granted the State's motion to dismiss and denied the inmate's summary judgment motion, without a hearing. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate fired his counsel during trial. The appellate court held res judicata barred ineffective assistance claims made in his new trial motion and on direct appeal in spite of additional evidence and arguments as the evidence could have been included with the new trial motion, and the arguments could have been made on direct appeal. The credibility of his affidavits could be dismissed as (1) the trial court presided at trial, (2) the affidavits contained and relied on hearsay, and (3) they were cumulative of trial testimony. Counsel's alleged ineffectiveness did not prejudice the inmate because he assumed his own defense. Res judicata barred a claim that his judicial release ineligibility was cruel and unusual and an equal protection violation because he knew he was ineligible when he was sentenced. Since his sentence was not cruel or unusual, requiring him to serve it without judicial release satisfied the Eighth Amendment. Equal protection was not violated because (1) he was not a member of a suspect class, (2) judicial-release eligibility was not a fundamental right, and (3) those ineligible for judicial release due to sentences over ten years were treated similarly.</SPAN></P>

Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing consecutive sentences because it gave careful and substantial deliberation to the relevant statutory considerations. Because Ohio's former consecutive-sentencing statutory provisions, R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) and R.C. 2929.41(A) had not been revived, no findings were required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grounds defendant asserted in support of his petition for postconviction relief included a narrative of many alleged civil rights violations and included such claims as improper sentencing, ineffective assistance of trial counsel and unconstitutional imprisonment for a civil debt. He also took exception to the trial court's prohibiting defendant from filing any other motions except those allowed by law. On appeal, the court found that three of the four assignments of error raised issues that could have been raised on a direct appeal of defendant's conviction, but were not. Further, although the merits of the claims were nevertheless barred by res judicata, the claims had no merit even if they were properly before the court. As to the trial court's prohibiting defendant from filing any other motions except those allowed by law, the trial court had inherent power to curb frivolous litigation practices to protect the integrity of its own processes. The trial court did not abuse that power by prohibiting defendant from filing frivolous motions in the case.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy, and by convicting him under an ordinance that violated the ex post facto clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The appellate court disagreed. First, although the offenses for which defendant was convicted took place under similar circumstances, each offense was a different act, performed at a different time, with police responding to alarms on two separate occasions. Therefore, there was no double jeopardy violation. Furthermore, defendant was convicted due to his failure to obtain a permit in 1995 and 1999, illegal acts that occurred after the effective date of the ordinance. The ordinance was not an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to two counts of rape, felonies in the first degree. The Geauga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) accepted the plea. Following a hearing, defendant was adjudicated a sexual predator, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B). He was ordered to serve seven years imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant began having sex with the victims when they were 10 and 11 years old. The appellate court held that the trial court's adjudication of defendant as a sexual predator was supported by clear and convincing evidence as the trial court properly concluded, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B)(3), that defendant was likely to commit another sexual offense in the future. The trial court found that defendant was diagnosed as a pedophile, that he was obsessed with a 12-year-old child, and that he would most likely desire to continue the sexual relationship with the child. Other statutory factors included: the age of the victims; the fact that there were multiple victims; they were family members; and the nature and number of times the sexual offenses occurred. However, although the trial court conducted an extensive review of the statutory factors at the adjudication hearing and issued a separate judgment entry at the conclusion of the sexual predator hearing which enumerated its statutory findings, it failed to comply with the requirements enumerated in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B)(4) by failing to include its findings in the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the trial court did not comply with the sexual predator statute in issuing the judgment of conviction, the matter was remanded to the trial court for the sole issue of making its findings in the judgment of conviction. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1988, defendant was convicted of rape, kidnapping, and gross sexual imposition. After completing his sentence, pursuant to R.C. 2950.031 and R.C. 2950.032, of the Adam Walsh Act, he was reclassified as a Tier III sex offender, with a 90-day registration requirement. The Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) convicted dim of failure to verify his current address, in violation of R.C. 2950.06(F). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it found him guilty of failing to verify his current address. The appellate court held that defendant's reclassification as a Tier III sex offender was unlawful, and could not serve as the predicate for the crime for which he was indicted and convicted, failure to register under R.C. 2950.06(F). The attorney general reclassified defendant based upon R.C. 2950.031 and R.C. 2950.032, which had been declared unconstitutional because they violated the doctrine of separation of powers. The statutes could not be applied to offenders previously adjudicated by judges under Megan's Law, former R.C. Chapter 2950, and the classification of sexually oriented offender and community-notification and registration orders imposed previously by the trial court had to be reinstated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and the cause was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed and defendant insurance company cross-appealed the decision of the trial court (Ohio) which awarded plaintiffs prejudgment interest but denied plaintiffs attorney fees in a cause action brought against defendant by plaintiff for underinsured motorist benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a motor vehicle accident, plaintiffs brought a declaratory judgment cause of action against defendant insurance company for underinsured motorist benefits. The trial court found that plaintiffs were not entitled to underinsured motorist benefits and dismissed plaintiffs' action. On remand, the trial court found that the plaintiffs were entitled to underinsured motorist benefits in the amount of $ 100,000. Plaintiffs then moved for prejudgment interest and attorney fees. The trial court awarded plaintiffs prejudgment interest but denied them attorney fees. The appellate court affirmed. Prejudgment interest was appropriate under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1343.03(A) because plaintiffs' claim for underinsured motorist benefits was a contract claim and the benefits were due and payable based on an instrument of writing. Prejudgment interest began accruing from the date of the accident because plaintiffs were denied use of the benefits while defendant enjoyed economic gain. Plaintiffs were not entitled to attorney fees, however, because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.16 was remedial in nature and its prohibition against attorney fees was intended to be retroactive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Plaintiffs were entitled to prejudgment interest on their underinsured motorist claim because their claim arose in contract. Plaintiffs were not entitled to attorney fees, however, because the statutory prohibition against attorney fees was intended to be retroactive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant pled guilty to abduction, and upon completion of the sentencing hearing, the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) orally pronounced defendant a sexual predator.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant appealed, the trial court changed the judgment entry and sentencing addendum to show that defendant was classified as a sexual predator. The appellate court ruled that the trial court's oral pronouncement was not a judgment. The later judgment entry and sentencing addendum, ruling that defendant was a sexually oriented offender, was a judgment. Since the trial court's later amendment of its sentencing addendum and corrected judgment entry was done after the appeal was filed and was inconsistent with the appellate court's jurisdiction, the trial court did not have jurisdiction amend its ruling, and those orders were nullities. The trial court's application of former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01(D)(2)(a) to defendant did not violate substantive due process guarantees. Defendant's contention that his classification as a sexually oriented offender violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was unpersuasive. Since the appellate court determined that the trial court's post-appeal changes were nullities, defendant's argument that the evidence did not support his classification as a sexual predator was moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court denied appellee alleged father's motion for relief from a paternity determination, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3119.961 et seq., the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio) reversed. The Ohio Supreme Court accepted a discretionary appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3119.961 et seq., providing for relief from determinations of paternity, were unconstitutional because they infringed upon the exclusive authority of the Ohio Supreme Court to prescribe procedural rules for Ohio courts. The court of appeals found &sect; 3119.961 et seq. did not violate constitutional separation of powers, because those sections established a substantive right, not a procedural right. The supreme court held the general assembly, in enacting the statutes' predecessor, specifically provided that it was a person's substantive right to obtain relief from a judgment requiring the person to pay child support, and the statutes were enacted to make it less likely that a person would be forced to support a child that was not his. While Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3119.961 and 3119.962 were packaged in procedural wrapping, the general assembly clearly intended to create a substantive right to address potential injustice. The statutes did not conflict with Ohio R. Civ. P. 60(B) in such a way as to violate separation of powers, under Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 5(B).</SPAN></P>
