</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part the circuit court's decision in favor of defendant Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (MMSD) on plaintiff landowner's allegation that MMSD's negligent operation and maintenance of a sewerage tunnel (Deep Tunnel) beneath the landowner's property resulted in excessive groundwater seepage, causing damage to the landowner's buildings. The landowner petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that the landowner proved that MMSD negligently caused a continuing private nuisance due to the manner in which MMSD chose to maintain the Deep Tunnel. MMSD had notice that excessively siphoning groundwater from around the landowner's building was interfering with the landowner's use and enjoyment of its property by damaging the foundation of the building. The circuit court properly concluded that MMSD was required to abate the private nuisance caused by MMSD's negligence maintenance of the Deep Tunnel. The supreme court concluded that the plain meaning of Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.80(3) (2011-12) was to limit the dollar amount of recovery to be paid for damages, injuries or death to $50,000 per claimant, but the provision had no bearing on the availability of equitable relief such as abatement. A municipal entity may be subjected to claims for equitable relief to abate a negligently maintained nuisance that was a cause of significant harm and of which the municipal entity had notice. A rational basis existed for the damage limitations in &sect; 893.80(3). The landowner substantially complied with the notice of claim requirements of Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.80(1) (2011-12).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed at that decision that the landowner was not entitled to equitable relief in the form of an order for abatement and remanded to the circuit court; the judgment was affirmed on all other issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners filed a petition to raise the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources-designated water levels of a lake. Respondent, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR), rejected the petition, and its denial was affirmed by an administrative law judge, by the county circuit court, and by the Wisconsin Court of Appeals. Petitioners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DNR properly considered the impact of the petition's proposed water levels on public and private wetlands in and adjacent to the lake. However, the DNR inappropriately relied on the public trust doctrine for its authority to protect non-navigable land and non-navigable water above the ordinary high water mark. But, the DNR had broad statutory authority grounded in the state's police power to protect non-navigable wetlands and other non-navigable water resources. Thus, contrary to petitioners' contentions, the DNR could consider the water level impact on all adjacent property under Wis. Stat. &sect; 31.02(1) (2009-10). In addition, under Wis. Stat. &sect; 31.02(1) (2009-10), the DNR rightly considered the direct impact of lower water levels on riparian properties, but wrongly excluded the cumulative economic effect of the lower water levels on those properties. The DNR had to consider the economic impacts of the lower water levels. Thus, the DNR erred when it excluded testimony on economic impacts of lower water levels when making a water level determination under Wis. Stat. &sect; 31.02(1) (2009-10).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the decision of the court of appeals and remanded the case to the circuit court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were separately convicted, in the Circuit Court for Marathon County (Wisconsin) of their child's second-degree reckless homicide, under Wis.

The case was certified to the Wisconsin Supreme Court to determine the scope of the prayer treatment exception in Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.03(6) (2009-10).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants tried prayer treatment. They said their prosecutions were unconstitutional because Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.03(6) (2009-10) protected prayer treatment but Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.06(1) (2009-10) criminalized it. The supreme court disagreed because (1) the reckless homicide statute differed from Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.03(a) and (c) (2009-10), the criminal child abuse statute to which the prayer provision applied, in the reckless nature of conduct, the mental state required, and the harm caused, so each gave fair notice of when actors might be liable or protected, and (2) juries could reasonably find defendants created a substantial risk of death, subjectively knew the risk, and caused the death. Wis. Stat. &sect; 751.06 (2009-10) did not require reversal because (1) the jury was properly instructed on their duty to provide medical care and the crime's subjective awareness element, and (2) counsel was not ineffective. Nothing showed being told of the mother's conviction biased the father's jurors because, (1) to convict him, the jury had to find he subjectively knew his conduct created a substantial risk to the child, and (2) the jury was told the trials' results could differ.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals, Wisconsin, affirmed, and defendant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's girlfriend, who was staying in defendant's home for the weekend, was alone while defendant was at work and using his laptop with his permission. She observed what appeared to be child pornography, arranged for the police to be called, and consented to an officer's entry into the home and inspection of the material on the computer. The Wisconsin Supreme Court found no Fourth Amendment violation. The girlfriend had a sufficient relationship to the premises to establish actual authority to consent to the officer's entry. Significant factors included the three-month duration of her relationship with defendant, the fact the he encouraged her to spend an evening alone in the home, and the fact that he placed no apparent restrictions on her use of the house. The court believed society would have expected a girlfriend of three months, left alone in a home and given unrestricted access to the common areas of the home, to enjoy the authority to invite guests in to those common areas, even with potentially deleterious consequences to her boyfriend. The girlfriend also had authority to consent to the search of the laptop, which she had permission to use.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision from the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which affirmed defendant's conviction for possession of child pornography under Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.12(1m) (2007-2008).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While on probation for a previous child pornography conviction, defendant was required to participate in sex offender group therapy. Defendant told his probation agent that he had used a computer he kept at a friend's house to access child pornography. The police investigated and found the computer, which led to a revocation of defendant's probation and additional criminal charges. Defendant asserted that he had signed a Wisconsin Department of Corrections form advising him that statements he made to his probation agent could not be used against him in criminal proceedings. He further asserted that he had been scheduled to take a mandatory polygraph test the day after his conversation with the probation agent. The court concluded that defendant had not met his burden of proving that his statements to his probation agent were compelled for Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. V, self-incrimination purposes because the record lacked sufficient evidence regarding his conditions of probation. Defendant's probation rules were not in the record. The record did not contain the form defendant described, nor did it show that defendant had been scheduled to take a mandatory polygraph test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with one count of attempted first-degree sexual assault of a child in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.02(1)(d) (2010). The complaint and information charged a violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.02(1)(d) (2010), but did not contain any allegations supporting the &quot;use or threat of force or violence&quot; element. Defendant was convicted on his plea of guilty to a violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.02(1)(d) (2010). The appellate court ordered the judgment of conviction to be amended according to the agreement of the prosecuting attorney, defense counsel, defendant, and the trial court to list the correct crime, a violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.02(1)(e) (2010). It also directed that defendant be resentenced accordingly. The state supreme court found that the trial court's error in incorrectly concluding that the five-year mandatory minimum sentence of the incorrect statutory provision applied did not belong to the class of cases involving structural error. Nevertheless, it determined that the State had not met its burden of showing that the error in not applying the correct statutory provision, which had no minimum, did not affect the eight-year sentence the trial court imposed.</SPAN></P>

IV, as applied to automobiles. The officers' decision to obtain a warrant prior to conducting the GPS search was proper. The seizure of defendant's vehicle was supported by probable cause that the vehicle was, or contained, evidence of a crime, and was therefore permissible. The seizure was supported by witnesses' reports that a car matching the make, model, and license plate number of that particular vehicle had been seen at the locations of recent burglaries in the area. That the device provided officers with real-time updates of movements did not alter the kind of information to be obtained under the warrant, or the nature of the intrusion allowed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled no contest to operating with a prohibited alcohol content, fourth offense, with an alcohol fine enhancer. The court of appeals affirmed the judgment. On review, the court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress. The police were following up on a major single-vehicle accident that left the front end of the car driven by defendant extensively damaged and a traffic pole completely knocked down. They validly entered the home where he resided on consent of his brother and after the brother broke open his bedroom door, without any prompting by the police, reasonably exercised their community caretaker function when they crossed the threshold into the bedroom. The police acted on their concern that he might have sustained a significant injury in the automobile accident. Further, the trial court properly denied defendant's collateral attack of his 1998 operating a motor vehicle under the influence conviction and thus considered the conviction in determining that he had three prior relevant convictions. Despite a technically deficient plea colloquy, he knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to counsel in the 1998 case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners alleged that an extension of the airport's runway amounted to the compensable taking of an easement because the resulting overflights had adverse effects on their properties, including diminished use and enjoyment and decrease of value.

The Supreme Court of Wisconsin held that the standard for a taking in an airplane overflight case was whether the overflights were low enough and frequent enough to have a direct and immediate effect on the use and enjoyment of the person's property. If this standard could be satisfied, the government had taken an easement without paying compensation for it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stipulated to the fact that the packages seized by the police contained more than 10,000 grams of tetrahydrocannabinol. The court held that appellate courts had to defer to reasonable inferences drawn by the jury from the evidence and had to consider the totality of the evidence when conducting a sufficiency of the evidence inquiry. Because a reasonable inference of defendant's guilt could have been drawn by the jury from the evidence presented at trial, viewed in its entirety, the evidence was sufficient to sustain his conviction. Defendant had a constitutional right to a jury determination of the drug quantity involved in his offense because the fact in question exposed him to a higher penalty. The trial court thus erred in determining the question without eliciting from defendant a proper waiver of his jury trial right. He was never informed he had a constitutional right to a jury determination of the drug quantity, nor was he ever given the opportunity to waive or invoke the right. However, the error was harmless because it was clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a properly instructed, rational jury would have found him guilty of the charged offense absent the error.</SPAN></P>

The reviewing court held that the order to transfer was an erroneous exercise of the circuit court's discretion, because the facts and the applicable law were not fully stated and considered together in making both the determinations that Wis. Stat. &sect; 801.54 (2009-10) required. A court that was considering transferring a case to a tribal court under the tribal transfer statute must conduct a two-part analysis. It must make a clear record of its findings and conclusions regarding concurrent jurisdiction, as well as an analysis of all of the rule's relevant factors on the facts presented. The record did not show that the facts of record and law relied upon were stated and were considered together in reaching the conclusion that the transfer to tribal court was warranted. Also, analysis was needed on the question of whether Wis.

The court held that ch. 980 did not require a dismissal because it: (1) did not contain language allowing for dismissal in the instant case; (2) did not set a time period for execution of a commitment order; and (3) stated that an individual could be simultaneously committed under ch. 980 and incarcerated at a Department of Corrections facility.</SPAN></P>

Because the stop of defendant's vehicle was supported by reasonable suspicion, the circuit court erred in concluding that the stop was unconstitutional and that he was not lawfully placed under arrest. The case was further remanded to the circuit court to revoke defendant's operating privilege under Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305(9)(d) (2009-10).

The issuance of a search warrant was not an exercise of &quot;the judicial power,&quot; as that phrase was employed in Wis. Const. art. VII, &sect; 2. Instead, it required that the individual be authorized by law to issue the warrant, that he or she be neutral and detached, and that the warrant be issued only upon a showing of probable cause. Furthermore, Wis. Stat. &sect; 757.69(1)(b) did not impermissibly intrude upon the judicial power granted to the courts by Wis. Const. art. VII, &sect; 2. Because no challenge was made to the warrant except the constitutional challenge, the circuit court commissioner's search warrant was validly issued and the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

In the current case, the court found that police had probable cause to arrest defendant and assumed without deciding that defendant's warrantless arrest from his home was in violation of Payton. The court concluded that, pursuant to the Harris rule, the following evidence that police obtained outside of defendant's home was admissible: defendant's signed statement, made after defendant was given and waived his Miranda rights, a buccal swab obtained at the police station, and defendant's clothing seized at the jail, as well as any derivative evidence.</SPAN></P>

A registrant could not be convicted of violating Wis. Stat. &sect; 301.45(6) for failing to report the address at which he would be residing when he was unable to provide that information. A registrant was unable to provide the required information when that information did not exist, despite the registrant's reasonable attempt to provide it. The supreme court agreed with the State that homeless registrants were not exempt from registration requirements and that homelessness was not a defense to failing to comply with the registration requirements. However, the supreme court disagreed that defendant was capable of complying with the statute by listing a park bench or other on-the-street location. The legislature set forth an alternative procedure for monitoring the whereabouts of registrants who were unable to provide an address without imposing criminal liability.

The town appealed and the appellate court certified the appeal to the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town residents filed a complaint for declaratory judgment that alleged that each of them owned land in the town, had engaged in nonmetallic mining in the past, and may wish to do so on their land in the future. They contended that the Nonmetallic Mining Ordinance (Ordinance) was a zoning ordinance that was invalid because it did not have county board approval. If the Ordinance was not a zoning ordinance, county board approval was not required. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the town residents. The town's appeal presented one issue: &quot;Is the town's Nonmetallic Mining Ordinance a zoning ordinance?&quot; The state supreme court found that it was not a zoning ordinance. It scrutinized the Ordinance in light of the characteristics and purposes of traditional zoning ordinances, and concluded that, despite having some similarities to traditional zoning ordinances, the Ordinance was not to be classified as a zoning ordinance. It held that the Ordinance was a non-zoning ordinance adopted under the town's police power. Accordingly, it found that the ordinance did not need county board approval, and that the trial court's judgment could not stand.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court rejected petitioner's contention that the State bore the burden of proof to establish that his continued confinement was appropriate and held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.08(4)(cg) (2005) unambiguously places the burden of proof with the committed individual. While the statute did not set forth the burden of proof required, the court held that, because the concerns for the public safety that justified restricting petitioner's liberty in the initial commitment were perhaps even more strongly implicated in the decision to release him back into the community because the initial determination involved a finding that the individual is likely to reoffend, in the absence of a statutory directive to the contrary, it was appropriate to require petitioner to bear the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence that he was entitled to supervised release.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners sought a declaratory judgment under Wis. Stat. &sect; 806.04 (2008) that the joint action of the two town boards resulted in discontinuance of a road surrounded by land that they owned. The trial court granted summary judgment to the property owners upon concluding that under Wis.

On appeal, the appellate court affirmed. On the one town's request for further review, the state supreme court found that &quot;acting together&quot; in the context of Wis. Stat. &sect; 82.21(2) (2008) did not require an aggregate counting of votes and that statute did not mandate the creation of a new, combined board. Rather, it found that approval of both town boards, after they came together to resolve a joint application, was necessary to approve that application. It also found that since Wis. Stat. &sect; 82.15 (2008) contemplated certiorari review under Wis. Stat. &sect; 68.13 (2008) as the prescribed method for review of &quot;a highway order, or a refusal to issue such an order,&quot; the trial court should have denied the property owners' declaratory judgment request.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A family owned companies. The first son's employment ended after conflicts arose. The father and second son sued seeking specific performance of an agreement requiring the first son to surrender his shares in plaintiff company. The first son counterclaimed alleging that they had &quot;squeezed&quot; him out of it. A jury found, inter alia, that they had breached fiduciary duties owed to him. The jury ordered the father to pay, inter alia, punitive damages to him. The trial court granted specific performance, and found that the first son had not shown Wis. Stat. &sect; 180.1430(2)(b) (2006) oppression. It then allowed the father to file a post-verdict motion a day late. The appellate court found the trial court should not have considered the tardy postverdict motion, the first son waived an appeal as to the statutory oppression claim, and he waived a claim about limiting the evidence he could present. The state supreme court found the postverdict motion was untimely under Wis. Stat. &sect; 805.16 (2006), the first son, no longer a shareholder, lacked standing as to the oppression claim, and the limit on evidence was error since he was trying to show he was owed &quot;fair market value&quot; for his shares.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. The case already involved two defendants, only one of whom testified. Over the course of the four-day trial, testimony was taken from sixteen witnesses, including the surviving victim of the crime. The jury was already presented with the difficult task of taking the often-conflicting testimony it heard and weighing it on two charges against two separate defendants. The trial court was concerned that the jury would be misled into an improper focus on questions about motive and the alleged history of abuse between the victim and the sister. Both were legitimate concerns, and therefore, defendant's right to cross-examination was not violated when the trial court limited his cross-examination of his sister.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county undertook a county highway reconstruction and maintenance project. To complete the project, it determined that it would need to remove trees and fences along the farm property of the property owners on the county highway. It figured it could do so because those items were within its right-of-way. The property owners filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that the county was incorrect. The trial court granted the county's summary judgment motion. The appellate court affirmed. The state supreme court found that the property owners introduced sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption under Wis. Stat. &sect; 82.31 (2008) that the county highway was 66 feet, or four rods, wide. It cited a survey map that the property owners' licensed land surveyor provided, as well as affidavits from each of the property owners, that indicated the county had never maintained the trees or fence line along the county highway in the several decades that they had existed in the same location. That, the state supreme court found, was sufficient to find that a genuine issue of material fact existed about the width of the highway and right to remove the trees and fences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer effected a traffic stop. As he approached the vehicle, he observed defendant make furtive movements that indicated that he might be hiding something beneath the driver's seat. When the officer spoke to defendant, he noticed that defendant's hands were shaking as if he were very nervous. Back in his patrol car, the officer accessed his computer and contacted dispatch about defendant's arrest record and learned that defendant had a recent drug delivery arrest as well as arrests for armed robbery, false imprisonment, and murder. The officer called for backup; when backup arrived, he frisked defendant and searched the area inside the car within his reach and discovered drugs. On review, the court held that under the totality of the circumstances, the officer's observation of defendant's furtive movements and visible nervousness, a record of arrests for violent crimes, and a drug delivery arrest that had occurred nearby a short time before the stop constituted specific and articulable facts that, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, created reasonable suspicion and justified a protective search for the officer's safety.</SPAN></P>

He then pled guilty to an amended aggravated battery charge and a second, separate misdemeanor bail jumping charge. A new trial court sentenced him on those convictions, with those sentences to be served concurrently to each other, but consecutive to any other sentence, including the original misdemeanor bail jumping conviction. He filed a post-conviction petition for additional sentence credit, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.04 (2008) and allegedly to prevent double jeopardy. The trial court denied it. The appellate court affirmed. The state supreme court found he was not entitled to relief. It found that because the new aggravated battery sentence was imposed consecutive to other sentences, it did not count as time &quot;previously served&quot; for the purpose of calculating sentence credit that he had received on the misdemeanor bail jumping as a habitual offender conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court was a petition for leave to appeal a non-final order and accompanying motion for temporary relief. The petition and accompanying motion arose out of a case originating in the Dane County Circuit Court, Wisconsin, in which plaintiff district attorney alleged violations of Wisconsin's Open Meetings Law, Wis. Stat. &sect; 19.81 et seq., in connection with the enactment of a budget repair bill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the circuit court usurped the legislative power which the Wisconsin Constitution granted exclusively to the legislature. The circuit court exceeded its jurisdiction, invaded the legislature's constitutional powers under Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 1 and 17, and erred in enjoining the publication and further implementation of the budget repair bill. The legislature did not violate the Wisconsin Constitution by the process it used to enact the bill. The doors of the senate and assembly were kept open to the press and members of the public during the enactment of the bill. The doors of the senate parlor, where the joint committee on conference met, were open to the press and members of the public. Regarding the argument that the bill was invalid because the legislature did not follow certain notice provisions of the Open Meetings Law for the meeting of the joint committee on conference, the court noted the legislature relied on its interpretation of its own rules of proceeding. The court declined to review the validity of the procedure used to give notice of the joint committee on conference.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All orders and judgments of the circuit court in this case were vacated and declared to be void ab initio.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant, who was 14 years old at the time of the offense, of first-degree intentional homicide and physical abuse of a 13-year-old victim as a party, under Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 940.01(1), 948.03(2)(b), 939.05 (1997-98). The circuit court denied his post-conviction motion for relief from a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The Court of Appeals, Wisconsin, affirmed, and defendant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Wisconsin Supreme Court held that sentencing a 14-year-old defendant to life imprisonment without parole was not categorically cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment or Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The court found no national consensus against sentencing a 14-year-old to life imprisonment without parole when the crime was intentional homicide and also concluded, in the exercise of it own independent judgment, that the punishment is not categorically unconstitutional. The court also rejected defendant's alternative arguments. First, the sentence was not excessive under the circumstances. The manner in which defendant took the victim's life was horrific and senseless, and defendant refused to take responsibility. That he was just 14 years old and suffered an indisputably difficult childhood did not automatically make his punishment disproportionate. Second, defendant did not demonstrate that new scientific research regarding adolescent brain development constituted a new factor that frustrated the purpose of the sentence. Finally, defendant did not demonstrate that the circuit court relied on the religious beliefs of the victim's family when imposing the sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Grant County, Wisconsin, that terminated his parental rights. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals certified the appeal for higher review in order to resolve the ambiguities and uncertainties regarding the use of Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(6) (2007-08) as a ground to terminate parental rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that, when applying Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(6) in proceedings for the termination of parental rights, the fact-finder should consider the involvement of the parent over the entirety of the child's life, including the time when the child was in-utero. Although a parent's lack of opportunity to establish a substantial relationship was not a defense to the failure to assume parental responsibility, the reasons for a parent's lack of involvement could still be considered in the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis. The fact-finder could also consider whether the parent, while caring for the child, exposed the child to a hazardous living environment. The evidence was sufficient to support the jury's finding that the father failed to assume responsibility for his daughter because, in the four years of her life leading up to the termination proceeding, the father had actual custody for only the child's first four months of life. He never had legal custody of her, and after four months, he provided no financial or material support. In addition, the father moved to Illinois and had little to no contact with his daughter since she was approximately five months old.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order terminating the father's parental rights was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the mother of his two children became involved in an argument that escalated into the shooting of the mother's brother, leaving him paralyzed. At trial, the central focus was whether defendant acted with utter disregard for human life, an element of Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.23(1)(a). The court of appeals reversed defendant's conviction, concluding that the trial court's supplemental jury instruction on utter disregard was erroneous. On review, the court rejected the State's argument that defendant's after-the-fact mitigating conduct did not have the same evidentiary weight as his actions before and during the crime and held that, in an utter disregard analysis, defendant's conduct was not, as a matter of law, assigned more or less weight whether the conduct occurred before, during, or after the crime. When evaluating whether defendant acted with utter disregard for human life, the fact-finder was to consider any relevant evidence in regard to the totality of the circumstances. There was no bright-line rule regarding the evidentiary weight of a particular category of defendant's conduct depending on when that conduct occurred relative to the crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the court of appeals was reversed, and the case was remanded to that court to decide the other claims raised by defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the statements made by the dying victim to a paramedic and an officer were improperly admitted and violated defendant's confrontation rights under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The supreme court disagreed. Defendant conceded that the dying declaration exception was an established hearsay exception at common law. Allowing that hearsay exception comported with the protections of the Confrontation Clause. While the United States Supreme Court had yet to give its explicit blessing to the dying declaration exception, it had given no reason to abandon a principle that was so deeply rooted in the common law. The fairest way to resolve the tension between the State's interest in presenting a dying declaration and a defendant's concerns about unreliability was not to prohibit such evidence, but to continue to freely permit the aggressive impeachment of a dying declaration on any grounds that might be relevant. In other words, if there was evidence the declarant had a motive to accuse falsely, introduce it. If there was evidence that the declarant was cognitively impaired and incapable of perceiving events accurately, introduce it.</SPAN></P>

Because defendant's right to counsel had attached and was affirmatively invoked before questioning was initiated and because the trial court's finding that the investigator knew that defendant had secured legal counsel for the pending charge was not clearly erroneous, defendant was not required to re-invoke his right to counsel when the investigator initiated interrogation, and his statements had to be suppressed.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court then granted the taxpayer's request to allow an appeal challenging the appellate court's ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Legislature passed 2007 Wis. Sess. Laws 86, which allowed municipalities to pass an ordinance opting out of de novo review as a method of challenging property tax assessments. Taxpayers in those &quot;opt out&quot; municipalities were restricted to a new form of trial court review. That review was broader in scope than traditional certiorari review but narrower in scope than de novo review. The taxpayer, who owned property in the city, filed a lawsuit to challenge that law. The trial court found that the law unconstitutionally denied taxpayers residing in opt out municipalities equal protection of the laws by depriving those taxpayers of access to de novo review without a rational basis for doing so. The appellate court reversed. The state supreme court found that the process for reviewing property tax assessments dictated by 2007 Wis. Sess. Laws 86 made treatment for those taxpayers subject to it significantly different for all other taxpayers without a rational basis for doing so and, accordingly, that law violated the equal protection provisions of Wis. Stat. art. I, &sect; 1 and the Fourteenth Amendment. The state supreme court also found that the offending provisions were severable.</SPAN></P>

The reviewing court held that the petitioners had not demonstrated how review would differ if the reviewing court proceeded under the standards set forth in Wis. Stat. &sect; 62.23(7)(e)10. The petitioners failed to provide a persuasive rationale for upsetting the longstanding jurisprudence and the reviewing court declined to alter the established scope of statutory certiorari. Also, the board's interpretation of the farm income requirement was entitled to a presumption of correctness, and the reviewing court would accord it deference. The petitioners had not met their burden of showing that the board's interpretation was unreasonable. The board made a finding of fact that the farm income requirement was not met, and the petitioners had failed to demonstrate that no reasonable view of the evidence supported that finding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge believed he would have been encouraged to process cases in a more timely manner if there had been additional clerk support so he would not have been required to spend time performing tasks that he believed to be more properly the work of a clerk. The Commission alleged that, by allowing a backlog to accumulate, the judge violated Wis. Sup. Ct. R. 60.04(1)(h). The panel concluded that the judge's failure to decide cases in a timely fashion constituted judicial misconduct under Wis. Stat. &sect; 757.81(4)(a) (2007-08). The panel found that the judge also violated Wis. Stat. &sect; 757.81(4)(b) (2007-08) by refusing to adjudicate virtually all parking ticket stipulation cases for nearly a year. The supreme court agreed with the panel that a reprimand was the appropriate discipline for the judge's misconduct. There was no conceivable reason that might justify a backlog of 3,500 cases, some of which were more than seven years old. The likelihood of similar conduct by the judge was minimal.</SPAN></P>

The Wisconsin Court of Appeals certified five questions regarding the authority of Wisconsin courts to order a new trial in the interests of justice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of sexual assault, his conviction had been affirmed on appeal, and he exhausted his postconviction remedies in state and federal court, the conviction of one of his co-defendant was vacated. Thereafter, defendant sought a new trial under Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 805.15 and 806.07, and the circuit court granted the requested relief, even though it had previously rejected defendant's identical argument. On review, the court held that neither Wis. Stat. &sect; 805.15(1) nor Wis. Stat. &sect; 806.07(1)(g) or (h) was an available procedural mechanism for a convicted criminal defendant to challenge his or her conviction or sentence, and Wisconsin circuit courts lacked the inherent authority to order a new trial in the interest of justice when a case was not before the court under a proper procedural mechanism. While the circuit court did have inherent powers, a broad, inherent power to order a new trial in the interest of justice at any time, unbound by concerns for finality and proper procedural mechanisms, was not one of them.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 944.11(2) (1965-66), arguing that the tolling provision of Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.74(3) (2007-08) was unconstitutional and that the charges were barred by due process where 36 years passed between the offenses and the charges.</SPAN></P>

A criminal complaint was not filed until 2005, after the priest's victims met each other and learned of their similar abuse. On review, the court held that the fact that defendant had not been in hiding and did not flee justice did not render Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.74(3)&nbsp;unconstitutional as applied to him. Further, the statute did not violate the Privileges and Immunities, Due Process, or Equal Protection provisions of the United States Constitution, and Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.74(3) did not burden a fundamental right and was rationally related to the legitimate governmental interests of detecting crimes and apprehending criminals. In addition, that a significant amount of time had elapsed since the commission of the offenses and the filing of charges did not warrant postconviction relief because petitioned failed to show a violation of his due process rights. Because petitioner could not demonstrate an improper motive on the part of the State, he failed to allege a necessary prerequisite for dismissal based on pre-indictment delay.</SPAN></P>

Based upon information that the police obtained through tracking defendant, defendant was again charged with and convicted of stalking. On review, the court held that the circuit court properly denied defendant's suppression motion because the order authorizing law enforcement to install and monitor a GPS tracking device on defendant's vehicle constituted a valid warrant under Wis. Stat. &sect; 968.12(1) (2007-08) because it was signed by a neutral and detached judge, was supported by probable cause, and described with particularity the object into which the GPS device was to be placed. Further, execution of the warrant was reasonable under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Wis. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a suit alleging an unconstitutional taking, plaintiff health care providers appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin, that dismissed their suit against defendant, the Wisconsin Secretary of State, on the ground that they lacked a property interest in the Injured Patients and Families Compensation Fund, the property at issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of the state budget, the Wisconsin Legislature authorized the transfer of $ 200 million from the Injured Patients and Families Compensation Fund (the Fund) to the Medical Assistance Trust Fund through 2007 Wis. Act 20, &sect; 9225. To implement the Act, the Secretary of State transferred the funds. The health care providers challenged the transfer as an unconstitutional taking. On review of the order of dismissal, the court held that the health care providers had a constitutionally protected property interest in the Fund. Wis. Stat. &sect; 655.27(6) (2007-08) defined the Fund as an irrevocable trust, and the structure and purpose of the Fund satisfied all of the elements necessary to establish a formal trust. Because the health care providers were specifically named as beneficiaries of the trust, they had equitable title to the assets of the Fund. Because the health care providers had protected property interests in the Fund, &sect; 9225 of 2007 Wis. Act 20 was unconstitutional because it authorized an unconstitutional taking of private property without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the circuit court was reversed, and the case was remanded to the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that it was unnecessary to address whether defense counsel was deficient because petitioner was not prejudiced by any alleged deficiencies. The trial court would have properly denied petitioner's motion to suppress even if defense counsel had raised the argument that the police created their own exigent circumstances because petitioner's consent to permit the police to search was given freely and voluntarily and not merely in acquiescence to police authority. Petitioner's consent was voluntary despite the fact that a police officer had his gun drawn when petitioner answered the door because the officer holstered his gun before asking petitioner for consent to search and he did not demand entry or use a threat or physical force. Further, petitioner orally consented to a search and reaffirmed his giving of consent. The fact that he subsequently refused to sign a consent form did not vitiate his consent, render his oral consent involuntary, or render the search unlawful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the police officers' &quot;knock and talk&quot; entry into defendant's apartment was lawful and reasonable because it was supported by probable cause and justified by exigent circumstances. The police officers' warrantless entry into the apartment was supported by probable cause because, once the officers corroborated each of the three preliminary details provided by their anonymous informant who told them that defendant was selling drugs from his apartment, it was reasonable for the officers to then believe, as the informant had alleged, that evidence of illegal drug activity would probably be found in defendant's apartment. Further, the police officers' warrantless entry into defendant's apartment was justified by exigent circumstances. The officers knocked and announced their presence and immediately heard footsteps running away from the door. Therefore, the officers reasonably believed that defendant would destroy evidence of his illegal drug activity, and exigent circumstances permitted them to enter to prevent the destruction of evidence. Once inside the apartment, the officers lawfully seized the evidence in plain view and arrested Robinson.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police received an anonymous tip that two individuals at a home appeared to be sleeping next to drugs and drug paraphernalia and that the door to the residence was standing open. Police officers proceeded to the home and entered to ensure that the occupants were not the victims of any type of crime such as robbery and were uninjured. The officers awaking defendant and the female occupant, arrested defendant, and seized the drugs that were in plain view. On review, the court held that the officers' warrantless entry into the home to ensure the health and safety of the occupants was undertaken as a bona fide community caretaker function. The officer could reasonably have been concerned that defendant and his companion had overdosed on drugs. The open doors to defendant's house and bedroom, along with defendant's unresponsiveness to the officers' repeated efforts to rouse him and his companion by knocking on the door, also could indicate a drug overdose. Accordingly, the police officers had an objectively reasonable basis for deciding that entry was necessary to ensure the health and safety of the occupants, and the officers lawfully seized drugs that were in plain view.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court held that the good faith exception precluded application of the exclusionary rule under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, where the officers conducted a search in objectively reasonable reliance upon clear and settled Wisconsin precedent that was later deemed unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court. Under the Supreme Court's ruling in Arizona v. Gant, the search at issue violated defendant's constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. However, because the search was lawful under Wisconsin law as it existed before Gant, the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of an alcohol-related offense. When he left a meeting with the agent assigned to complete his pre-sentence investigation (PSI), a civil warrant for his arrest was issued based upon his failure to appear in court. A deputy sheriff executed the warrant and found defendant intoxicated in violation of the conditions of his release. As a result, defendant was charged with bail jumping. Although the State conceded that the arrest warrant was invalid, it nevertheless argued that the good faith exception applied to permit evidence of defendant's intoxication into evidence. On review, the court held that the arrest warrant was ab initio, and the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply when a warrant was void. The warrant was void because the circuit court did not have statutory authority to issue a warrant for failure to meet with the PSI agent and because failure to cooperate with the PSI agent was not a crime. Further, walking out on a meeting with a PSI agent did not constitute failing to appear in court. In addition, the civil arrest warrant was void because the matter pending before the circuit court was criminal in nature, not civil.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 102.17(4) and Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.66(1) (2005-06) to be unconstitutional. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals certified the question for resolution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the retroactive application of Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 102.17(4) and 102.66(1) (2005-06) violated plaintiff worker's compensation insurer's due process rights under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV because the insurer had a vested property right in the prior statute of limitations, which limited its liability to pay for an injured employee's benefits or treatment once 12 years from the day of the last payment of compensation had passed. Further, retroactive application impaired the insurer's contractual rights because it contracted to provide insurance in reliance upon the established liability limit and based its pricing and premiums on  the law as it existed under Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 102.17(4) and 102.66(1) (2003-04), including the 12-year statute of limitations applicable to traumatic injury claims. Retroactive application altered the contractual expectations of the insurer by renewing its liability on an injured employee's claim after its original liability expired on the date the statute of limitations ran; as such, the legislation impaired the obligation of contract in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 12.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Wisconsin Court of Appeals that affirmed a circuit court's judgment of conviction and order denying defendant's post-conviction motion for a new trial, arguing that the circuit court erred in denying his request to substitute counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the circuit court erred in failing to appoint new counsel because, due to a profound hearing impairment, he was unable to communicate with his attorney. On review, the court held that the record amply supported the circuit court's conclusion that defendant and his trial counsel communicated effectively without a sign language interpreter, including letters from defense counsel to defendant, testimony that defendant did not dispute that counsel met with him and reviewed discovery with him, the circuit court's observation of defendant's communications with counsel, testimony that defendant read lips, and testimony of defendant's mother that she did not know sign language and never used it to communicate with her son. Even if defendant was dissatisfied with counsel and took offense at counsel's assessment of the strength of the State's case, it was clear from the record that the two communicated and that an adequate defense was presented. There was therefore no violation of defendant's right to counsel under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, and the circuit court properly denied defendant's motion for a new trial on that basis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant had been charged with various drug crimes and he and the prosecutor negotiated a plea agreement, which respondent judge of the Circuit Court for Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin, rejected. Appellant's motion for recusal was also rejected. Appellant petitioned for an interlocutory appeal and co-appellant state joined the petition. A Wisconsin court of appeals certified the appeal to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plea agreement involved a felony charge that was to be amended to three misdemeanors, another charge to be dismissed, and a recommendation by the prosecutor for specific sentencing. Appellant and the state argued that deference to the prosecutor's recommendation was warranted because it was made after consideration of all of the relevant facts and constituted a reasonable exercise of the prosecutor's inherent power and discretion. The court held that a circuit court must review a plea agreement independently and could, in an appropriate exercise of discretion, reject any plea agreement that did not serve the public interest. The public interest was a consideration that was not capable of precise outlines and the factors that the circuit court could weigh when defining the public interest involved would vary from case to case. The court also concluded that the circuit court's rejection of a plea did not in and of itself become a personal interest in the outcome of the matter and Wis. Stat. &sect; 757.19(2)(f) was not implicated here. However, because the record was undeveloped as to whether the judge had become a party to the case, the matter was remanded on this issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the circuit court denying the motion to amend the information pursuant to the plea agreement and the order denying appellant's initial motion seeking the judge's recusal. However, the court remanded the issue of whether the judge had become a party or amicus and whether recusal was now required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Wisconsin Office of Lawyer Regulation (OLR) filed a disciplinary complaint alleging that respondent attorney committed 11 separate acts of misconduct in four client matters. Pursuant to a stipulation the attorney entered a no contest plea. A referee recommended, among other things, suspension of the attorney's license to practice law for 12 months consecutive to disciplinary suspensions already imposed. The attorney did not appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney had been subject to discipline on several previous occasions and was suspended at the time of this proceeding. The four client matters at issue involved criminal proceedings in which the attorney did not timely file motions, did not inform her clients as to the status of their cases, did not follow the clients' directions, and failed to provide services that were necessary to preserve her clients' rights. The court agreed with the referee's recommendations and suspended the attorney's license to practice law in Wisconsin for 12 months consecutive to disciplinary suspensions already imposed, directed her to pay restitution to three of the clients, with interest until paid, as well as the costs of the proceeding, and to secure 20 credits of Wisconsin-approved continuing legal education ethics courses. Although the fourth client also argued that he should have received restitution, the court found that although the client might have had a civil action against the attorney, it appeared that the fee he paid did not meet the criteria the OLR used to assess whether restitution was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the court of appeals improperly remanded the case to the circuit court for further proceedings on defendant's claim that his trial counsel was ineffective. The supreme court agreed. Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim failed under the two-part inquiry of Strickland. First, his trial counsel's performance was not deficient. His counsel's strategic decision not to introduce evidence that the child victim was previously sexually assaulted was reasonable considering all the circumstances. Second, even assuming that his counsel's performance was deficient, the deficiency did not prejudice defendant's defense. Evidence that the child was previously sexually assaulted would have been inadmissible under Wisconsin's rape shield law, Wis. Stat. &sect; 972.11(2),  and the narrow exception. Counsel informed the circuit court that he had made the strategic decision not to present evidence that the child might have been previously sexually assaulted by a third party. He gave three reasons for his decision: (1) he thought the State would likely object; (2) he did not see it as relevant; and (3) he thought he would--if anything, build up sympathy for the child.</SPAN></P>

During the pendency of an appeal, Wis.

In a case of first impression in Wisconsin, the court held that &sect; 971.17(3)(c) and the administrative directive implementing it comported with the substantive and procedural due process provisions of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, facially and as applied. First, due process did not require a finding of dangerousness to issue an order compelling involuntary medication of a person committed under Wis. Stat. ch. 971. Nevertheless, &sect; 971.17(3)(c) and the directive effectively provided for such a finding. Second, due process required periodic review of the compelled involuntary medication order. Section 971.17(3)(c) and the directive satisfied that requirement as well. Finally, defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's orders compelling involuntary medication and denying defendant's motion for relief from the involuntary medication order.</SPAN></P>

The Brown County Circuit Court (Wisconsin) concluded that Wis.

Stat. &sect; 940.30 (1999-2000), and denied his motion to dismiss the charge. The court of appeals affirmed and appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that Wis. Stat. &sect; 301.45 was unconstitutional as applied to him because it required him to register as a sex offender even though his underlying conviction for false imprisonment of a minor was not of a sexual nature. Appellant acknowledged that &sect; 301.45 served a legitimate state interest, but argued that &sect; 301.45 was unconstitutional as applied to him because requiring him to register was irrational, arbitrary, and could not have been rationally related to any legitimate government interest. The court held that &sect; 301.45 was constitutional as applied to appellant because &sect; 301.45 was rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest and he failed to prove that the registration requirements as applied to him were unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. The legislature chose to require registration by those, like appellant, who committed the crime of falsely imprisoning a minor, regardless of whether that crime was of a sexual nature. The court must afford deference to the words chosen by the legislature and could not conclude that there was no legitimate government interest in requiring registration of such offenders.</SPAN></P>

An officer who had observed defendant speeding confronted defendant outside of his vehicle and ordered him to drop an unknown object that he held in his hand, and upon retrieving that object, the officer recognized it as an open cell phone and observed on the display screen an image of defendant smoking what appeared to be a marijuana blunt. The officer was justified in seizing defendant's cell phone and in viewing the marijuana image, which was in plain view. However, the evidence that the officer gleaned from searching other images was tainted and could not form the basis for a search warrant. However, based on exigent circumstances, the officer was justified in answering the incoming call to defendant's phone during which the caller ordered illegal drugs. That evidence was an untainted independent source that formed a valid basis for the search warrant when combined with the officer's knowledge of drug traffickers and defendant's juvenile record, along with the plain view of the image of the marijuana blunt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial in the Ozaukee County Circuit Court (Wisconsin), appellant was found guilty of operating while intoxicated (OWI), Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(a) and (b) (2005-06). The Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court's judgment and ruling that excluded an expert's report and opinion testimony based in part on the results of a preliminary breath test (PBT) appellant took just prior to arrest. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The expert's opinion was that appellant had a BAC below the legal limit at the time he was pulled over by police and that his BAC level only later rose above the limit as his body continued to absorb the alcohol. At issue was whether Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.303 created an absolute bar on the admission of PBT results in OWI prosecutions, even when used as the basis for an expert's opinion offered under Wis. Stat. &sect; 907.03, and, if so, whether such an application of the statute violated a defendant's constitutional right to present a defense. The court reached the same result under different analysis than in the courts below. The court held that in an OWI prosecution, even if the defendant established a constitutional right to present an expert opinion that was based in part on PBT results, the right to do so was outweighed by the State's compelling interest to exclude that evidence. Permitting the use of that evidence as the basis for an expert opinion would render meaningless the legislature's act forbidding such evidence in OWI prosecutions, an act that promoted efficient investigations of suspected drunk driving and furthered the State's compelling interest in public safety.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner employer argued that the suit was barred by the First Amendment because respondent's position was &quot;ministerial,&quot; but the trial court determined otherwise. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed. The employer sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that both the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and the Freedom of Conscience Clauses in Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 18, preclude employment discrimination claims under the WFEA for employees whose positions are important and closely linked to the religious mission of a religious organization. In the case at bar, respondent's school was committed to a religious mission - the inculcation of the Catholic faith and worldview - and her teaching position was important and closely linked to that mission. Respondent led prayer with her students, incorporated religious examples, symbols, and stories into other subjects, and helped celebrate school-wide celebrations of religious holidays. Significantly, respondent was a catechist for four days per week; that is, she taught Catholic doctrine and practice to her students. Respondent was not simply a public school teacher with an added obligation to teach religion. She was an important instrument in a faith-based organization's efforts to pass on its faith to the next generation. Therefore, respondent's age discrimination claim under the WFEA unconstitutionally impinged upon her employer's right to religious freedom.</SPAN></P>

After the building and the surrounding neighborhood deteriorated, the redevelopment authority created a redevelopment district and issued a relocation order. The redevelopment authority presented evidence that the building would cost more to renovate than the improvements would be worth and that it would cost more to demolish than the vacant land would be worth. A jury accordingly found that the undivided interest in the property had no value at the time of the taking. The court held that the unit rule, under which a condemnor paid the value of an undivided interest in a property rather than paying the value of each partial interest, was the applicable method of determining just compensation and did not allow the lessee to obtain a recovery based on equitable principles of fairness. Departure from the unit rule could be made only in rare and exceptional circumstances, and the lessee's failure to protect the value of its leasehold interest by means of contract law was not such a circumstance.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 19.31 et seq., a circuit court issued mandamus ordering disclosure of the employees' names. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals certified WSEU's appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that courts had jurisdiction to review whether the legislature's ratification of a collective bargaining agreement under Wis. Stat. &sect; 111.92(1)(a) (2005-06), without introducing a companion bill to specifically amend the Public Records Law, was sufficient to effect a change in that law because courts had jurisdiction to determine the meaning of statutes and of constitutional provisions. Ratification of the collective bargaining agreement was insufficient to amend the Public Records Law because Article 2/4/4, the provision of the agreement at issue, was not introduced in a bill or companion bills within the meaning of &sect; 111.92(1)(a), as that meaning was driven by the requirements of Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 17(2). Thus, the ratification of the agreement did not create an exception to the Public Records Law. Wis. Stat. &sect; 111.93(3) (2005-06) did not support WSEU's assertion that Article 2/4/4 superseded the disclosure provision of the Public Records Law. The court affirmed the circuit court's application of the balancing test, which it appeared the circuit court applied to the WSEU members as a group because that was how the issue was argued to the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a doctor and his insurer (doctor), sought review of the decision of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which found in favor of plaintiffs, a mother, father, and their surviving children, and affirmed the circuit court's decision reinstating the father's award for bystander negligent infliction of emotional distress. The appellate court also reversed the circuit court's ruling that the doctor was a borrowed employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After one of the parents' twins was unable to be resuscitated and died during birth, a subsequent malpractice action was instituted. The two questions presented for supreme court review were whether the doctor was a borrow employee of the hospital and whether the father was permitted to recover damages caused by the doctor's negligence on a theory of the negligent infliction of emotional distress to a bystander. The supreme court concluded that the doctor was a borrowed employee and accordingly, the doctor was an employee of a health care provider subject to Wis. Stat. ch. 655 and Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.55(4) (1997-98). As a result, the father's claim for bystander negligent infliction of emotional distress was subject to those statutory provisions. Because the father's claim was one for bystander negligent infliction of emotional distress and Wis. Stat. ch. 655 did not permit such claims, his claim was not recognized by Wisconsin law and therefore, the appellate court's decision was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the physicians, hospitals, and insurers, contended it was error to allow the family to withdraw their admissions. The supreme court disagreed, concluding that withdrawal of the admissions would subserve the presentation of the merits because if, as the newly-discovered entries in the medical records arguably indicated, the patient was capable of and did experience pain and suffering for the extended period between the time she lapsed into a coma to the time of her death, it was appropriate for the jury to consider that fact and, if liability was established, award damages to compensate that loss. Further, the physicians, hospitals, and insurers would not be prejudiced by the withdrawal of the admissions in maintaining their defense on the merits, and their increased exposure was not a pertinent consideration on the prejudice prong of Wis. Stat. &sect; 804.11(2) (2005-06). The family's admissions, if allowed to stand, would have effectively eliminated a determination on the merits of the issues of the patient's pain and suffering. Thus, granting the plaintiffs' motion to withdraw the admissions would aid in the ascertainment of the truth and the development of the merits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Wisconsin Court of Appeals that reversed a decision of the Jefferson County Circuit Court that held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.201(2)(c) (2005-06), which punished the unauthorized use of another individual's personal identifying information in order to harm that individual reputation, violated the right to freedom of speech under U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, without authorization, accessed his supervisor's e-mail account, reviewed messages between his supervisor and the woman with whom he was having an affair, and sent portions of their messages from the supervisor's account to various acquaintances; his supervisor committed suicide the next day. Defendant was charged with a violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.201(2)(c). On review of the appellate court opinion upholding the statute as constitutional, the court held that the statute, as applied to the facts of this specific case, was content based and regulated speech in addition to conduct because whether defendant's conduct was prohibited depended entirely upon whether defendant's speech--the content of the e-mails--was intended to be reputation-harming speech. As a result, the statute was to be analyzed under strict scrutiny. However, because the statute, as applied to defendant, was narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest, it was constitutional. The statute survived strict scrutiny in that it was narrowly tailored and applied only when a defendant intentionally used another individual's personal information to harm that individual's reputation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State argued that the officers acted in accordance with the law because they complied with Wis. Stat. &sect; 968.07(1)(d) (2005-06). The appellate court agreed, finding that the police had probable cause to arrest defendant for disorderly conduct; once she was removed from her house, the police were not required to re-arrest her for disorderly conduct in order to make her continued custody lawful. Therefore, her continuing struggles outside of her home occurred when the police were lawfully transporting her to the station house. Although the jury was not instructed about exigent circumstances, it did receive an instruction on lawful authority. The jury necessarily found that there were reasonable grounds to believe defendant was committing or had committed a crime because it convicted defendant of obstruction. Under the instruction given, the jury must have found that the officers acted pursuant to their lawful authority if it found that the officers had reasonable grounds to believe defendant was committing a crime. As the jury convicted defendant, it found this fact. Thus, if the failure to instruct the jury on exigent circumstances was error, it was harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim, who was defendant's nephew, was stabbed during a family gathering. The circuit court issued a sequestration order requiring witnesses to stay outside the courtroom until they testified and not to discuss their testimony. Two disturbances occurred among defendant's family members in the courtroom during testimony. The prosecutor suggested that persons entering and leaving the courtroom might have been violating the sequestration order by conveying information to prospective witnesses. Without objection, the circuit court excluded all of defendant's family members except his mother from the courtroom until testimony ended. Noting that the State did not raise the issue of forfeiture or waiver during the postconviction hearing, the court declined to address that issue. The court concluded that although the exclusion order implicated defendant's Sixth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VI, right to a public trial, the order was justified under the circumstances. Violations of the sequestration order seemed likely, the closure was not overbroad, the circuit court implicitly determined that no less restrictive alternatives existed, and the findings on the record were sufficient.</SPAN></P>

At one such event, the two children drowned. Their parents filed a negligence action, but the recreational facility was deemed immune under Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.52. On review, the court held that the recreational facility was a nonprofit organization under the recreational immunity statute and was immune from liability. The facility's articles of incorporation, tax returns, and financial statements established that it was organized and conducted as a nonprofit organization, a fact recognized by both Wisconsin and the federal government. That the recreational facility might have earned a profit did render it ineligible for classification as a nonprofit organization because nonprofit entities were barred from distributing profits to directors, officers, and members but were not barred from earning a profit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed orders from the Circuit Court for Pepin County (Wisconsin) denying his motions to suppress evidence and to withdraw his guilty plea. The Court of Appeals of Wisconsin certified a question under Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.61 (2005-06): whether the police may search the personal belongings of a passenger that were are found outside a motor vehicle incident to the arrest of the driver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After pulling over the vehicle defendant was a passenger in and arresting the driver, the officer searched an eyeglasses case lying on the ground next to the passenger door that defendant admitted belonged to him and found a glass methamphetamine pipe and some cleaning tools. On review, the court held that the search of the eyeglass case was a permissible search incident to the arrest of the driver because the officer was outnumbered at a late night arrest involving two men and he knew that narcotics were present. The proximity of the eyeglass case to the car, to defendant, and to the driver, as well as its unexplained location at defendant's feet, raised questions about the danger defendant posed acting alone or in concert with the driver. Because the warrantless search of the eyeglass case was lawful, the search of defendant was also lawful. Defendant's admitted ownership of the case containing a methamphetamine pipe gave the officer probable cause to arrest him and to search incident to that arrest. Defendant was not entitled to withdraw his guilty plea because he received the benefits of his plea bargain by avoiding a substantial period of incarceration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainant, the Wisconsin Office of Lawyer Regulation, filed a complaint against respondent attorney to initiate a disciplinary proceeding in this court. One of the 9 counts was a request under Wis. Sup. Ct. R. 22.22  for the imposition of discipline in Wisconsin reciprocal to a 30-day suspension imposed by the Supreme Court of Minnesota. The attorney filed a response to the court's order to show cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney argued that the counts for new misconduct should not have been included with the count for reciprocal discipline. The court agreed, holding that in cases of separate misconduct and reciprocal discipline, the counts should be brought in separate proceedings. The court rejected the attorney's argument that the copies of the other jurisdiction's orders were not certified. Although Wis. Sup. Ct. R. 22.22(2)(a) provided for a certified copy of the disciplinary judgment or order issued by the other jurisdiction to be attached to the complaint, the attachment of non-certified copies did not require the dismissal of the reciprocal discipline counts because any error was technical and did not prejudice the attorney. The court's imposition of discipline for professional misconduct that allegedly occurred in another state did not accord extraterritorial effect to Wisconsin's Rules of Professional Conduct for Attorneys. Rather, imposing reciprocal discipline was a means to ensure that Wisconsin attorneys comport themselves in a manner that promotes the efficient administration of the law and to protect the citizens of Wisconsin who needed competent and trustworthy attorneys.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Clark County (Wisconsin), which found in favor of defendant and suppressed evidence. The appellate court certified two issues to the supreme court concerning whether a dog sniff of a stopped vehicle was a search and whether the vehicle stop was unreasonably prolonged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court granted defendant's motion to suppress the weapon and the drugs obtained pursuant to the search conducted following a police dog's sniff of the exterior of the vehicle in which defendant was a passenger. The appellate court certified two issues to the supreme court: 1) Whether, under the Wisconsin Constitution, a dog sniff of a stopped vehicle was a search; and 2) whether the vehicle stop was unreasonably prolonged in duration by the officer's controlled substance investigation. The supreme court answered both questions in the negative. A dog sniff of the exterior of a vehicle located in a public place did not constitute a search under the Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. Secondly, the officer who performed a controlled substance investigation did not unreasonably prolong his seizure of defendant. The circuit court's finding that the dog sniff prolonged the detention by approximately 38 minutes was clearly erroneous. The dog sniff prolonged the detention by no more than 78 seconds. That 78 seconds was not an unreasonable incremental intrusion upon defendant's liberty. Thus, the dog sniff did not unreasonably prolong in duration the controlled substance investigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the circuit court was reversed, and the cause was remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings. Following remand, if a party moved the circuit court to determine whether the dog sniff was sufficient to establish probable cause to conduct a search of the vehicle, the supreme court's decision did not preclude the circuit court from holding a hearing on such a motion, if the circuit court chose to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a judgment of the Wisconsin Court of Appeals that reversed a circuit court ruling denying defendant's motion to suppress physical evidence and statements that law enforcement officers obtained following a warrantless entry into defendant's home and two subsequent warrantless searches of defendant's bedroom.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court determined that the issue turned on whether the law enforcement officers' two warrantless searches of defendant's bedroom were justified under the protective sweep and search incident to arrest exceptions to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, not the issue decided by the court of appeal, which was whether the law enforcement officers' warrantless entry into defendant's home to make a warrantless arrest was justified under the Fourth Amendment. In ruling that the circuit court erred in denying defendant's suppression motions, the court concluded that, where officers entered defendant home to arrest him for obstructing officers investigating an animal cruelty complaint, the officers did not have the right to search a canister in defendant's bedroom and seize its contents. Although the officer claimed to be conducting a protective sweep for individuals who might be armed, the canister was too small an object in which a person could hide. Further, the second search of defendant's bedroom likewise violated the Fourth Amendment; it was not a search incident to an arrest because defendant had already been removed from the home when the search was conducted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the Town contended the circuit court erred in ruling that Rhine, Wis., Municipal Code &sect; 4.08(2)(a) was unconstitutional on its face and in dismissing the nuisance ordinance violations against the members. The supreme court held that &sect; 4.08(2)(a), the B-2 District (the district in question), was unconstitutional on its face because it was arbitrary and unreasonable in that it precluded any use as of right (a &quot;no-permitted uses&quot; zone) in the B-2 District, and such a limitation had no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare. No justification existed for precluding all uses in the B-2 District and only providing the club with the possibility of obtaining a conditional use permit. However, the supreme court agreed that the circuit court erred by applying a common-law definition of &quot;nuisance&quot; rather than the definition of &quot;public nuisance&quot; articulated in Rhine, Wis., Municipal Code &sect; 2.02.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner brought a declaratory judgment action against defendant town, challenging the constitutionality of Cottage Grove, Wis., Land Division and Planning Code &sect; 15.15, and, inter alia, seeking approval of a final subdivision plat. The circuit court granted summary judgment to the town on the ground that the suit was not ripe. The Court of Appeals of Wisconsin reversed. The town's petition for review of the decision was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Since this was an appeal of a decision regarding a declaratory judgment action, the first issue was what standard of review to apply. Although a discretionary standard usually applied under Wisconsin's Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, Wis. Stat. &sect; 806.04 (2003-2004), the appellate court applied a de novo review to the ripeness determination. The landowner's claim for declaratory relief was ripe for review because, contrary to the circuit court's conclusion, the county board had extended the delayed effective date of conditional approval of the landowner's second zoning petition for one year. That fact demonstrated that the landowner was subject to compliance with &sect; 15.15 when he filed suit against the town because he was required to file a final plat with the town to receive ultimate rezoning approval from the county. The town required the landowner to first comply with &sect; 15.15 by acquiring 10 transfer of development rights before it allowed him to file his final plat. Thus, the landowner's efforts to rezone, subdivide, and develop his property were directly impacted by application of &sect; 15.15 when he filed the suit. As a result, his action for declaratory relief was ripe.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent mother appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Walworth County (Wisconsin), which terminated the mother's parental rights to her minor son on the ground that he had been adjudged a child in continuing need of protection or services, under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(2) (2005-06), by petitioner Walworth County Department of Health &amp; Human Services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties stipulated to the first ground terminating the mother's parental rights, namely that the child had been adjudged a child in need of protection or services (CHIPS). The mother contended that the stipulation constituted an invalid withdrawal of her demand for a jury trial on the CHIPS element. The court found that the stipulation addressed a single, undisputed, paper element where another element was the focus of the controversy, whether there was a substantial likelihood that the mother would not meet the conditions for return within a year. Regardless of the stipulation, the mother received a jury trial because the jury was presented with ample evidence and instructed on the CHIPS element. The circuit court did not err in failing to engage the mother in a personal colloquy to determine that the withdrawal was knowing and voluntary. The mother agreed to the stipulation in open court, and there was ample uncontroverted evidence to support the stipulated element. However, the court urged circuit courts in termination proceedings to consider engaging a parent in a colloquy to explain that a stipulation to an element withdrew that element from the jury's consideration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's order terminating the mother's parental rights.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the forehead qualified as an &quot;other bodily member&quot; under Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.21. Because the legislature intended the phrase to construed broadly rather than narrowly, the phrase encompassed all body parts, including a person's forehead. The application of the mayhem statute was limited by the need to prove that a person specifically intended to disable or disfigure. The court further held that the violent crime in a school zone penalty enhancement of Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.632 was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant because the legislature sought to deter violent crime near schools in an effort to create a safety zone around schools, and the 1,000-foot perimeter was a reasonable distance to try to accomplish the legislative goal. The legislature had clearly concluded that children congregated on or near school premises and were more likely to live near school premises. Under &sect; 939.632, the crime of mayhem was specifically included in the definition of &quot;violent crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>

According to clarifications by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), separate layers in multi-layered systems were to be analyzed separately, such that no averaging or dilution by combining layers of ACM with nonasbestos-containing material was allowed. The supreme court determined that: (1) the language of &sect; 1.7.2.1 was ambiguous; (2) giving deference to an agency's interpretation of its own rule, the EPA's interpretation was controlling because it was neither inconsistent with &sect; 1.7.2.1 nor clearly erroneous; (3) the EPA's clarifications did not constitute impermissible rule making, but were valid interpretive rules; and (4) the circuit court's judgment did not violate the company's substantive due process rights because there was nothing arbitrary in the circuit court's conclusion that tests showed that material from a disputed area was ACM.</SPAN></P>

The municipalities failed to demonstrate how their interests related to the subject of the action in a direct and immediate fashion. Moreover, their interests were adequately represented by the state entities. The municipalities were properly denied permissive intervention under Wis. Stat. &sect; 803.09(2) (2003-2004) as the circuit court's decision was based on reasonable consideration of delay. The circuit court also did not err in refusing to join the municipalities sua sponte under Wis. Stat. &sect; 803.03(1)(b)(1) (2003-2004) because if a person had no right of intervention under Wis.

Stat. &sect; 806.04(11) (2003-2004) was properly denied as the municipalities were not public officers charged with enforcing Wis. Stat. &sect; 40.02(2) (2003-2004).</SPAN></P>

Relocation assistance benefits did not have a direct relationship to the fair market value of a tenant's interest, and therefore, incidental or consequential damages were not considered in the constitutional requirement for just compensation. In satisfying its statutory obligation to make available a comparable replacement property pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 32.05(8)(b), (c) (2003-04), prior to being entitled to a writ of assistance, the city was required to proceed to identify one or more properties that met the parameters of Wis.

The petitioner requested the award be placed into an interest bearing account for the benefit of the ultimate recipients of the award. The petitioner's motion was granted by a circuit judge and support by the circuit court. The court of appeals reversed, finding that the circuit court did not have statutory authority to order the clerk of court to transfer the award into a private money market account. The reviewing court held that Wis.

The court further affirmed the dismissal with prejudice of the daughters' claim in their capacity as personal representatives of the husband's estate, as well as their claim in their capacity as adult children of the patient, because in a medical malpractice wrongful death case, adult children of the deceased were not listed as eligible claimants and therefore were not eligible because of the exclusivity of Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed a judgment of the circuit court dismissing with prejudice plaintiff patient's medical malpractice action against defendant, the University of Wisconsin Hospital &amp; Clinics Authority (UWHCA), because plaintiff failed to provide notice pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.80 (2003-04). Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole question on appeal was whether the UWHCA, as a statutorily-created, public body corporate and politic, was a &quot;political corporation&quot; for purposes of &sect; 893.80 (2003-04). The UWHCA was a &quot;political corporation&quot; because of the power and structure provided by the legislature in Wis. Stat. ch. 233 (2003-04). Because plaintiff failed to service the notice required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.80 on the UWHCA, he could not maintain his medical malpractice action against it. Plaintiff argued that &sect; 893.80 (2003-04) should not have applied to his case because of the exclusivity provisions of Wis. Stat. ch. 655 (2003-04) for bringing a medical malpractice claim. However, the notice statute was a specific statute of limitations which applied in medical malpractice cases against enumerated types of governmental bodies, such as political corporations. The language of Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.80(1m) (2003-04) explicitly anticipated the application of &sect; 893.80 to medical malpractice claims against governmental bodies. The generally exclusive nature of Wis. Stat. ch. 655 (2003-04) did not prevent the application of Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.80 (2003-04) in the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant oil company appealed a decision of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which applied the new Wis. Stat. &sect; 802.05 (2005-06) (new rule) and affirmed the denial of its motion for sanctions against plaintiff delivery company for the alleged frivolous commencement and maintenance of an action for the breach of a contract to deliver the oil company's petroleum products to customers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the new rule's effective date, the oil company obtained summary judgment and, relying on former Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 802.05 and 814.025 (2003-04) (former rules), filed a motion to impose sanctions against the delivery company for filing a frivolous breach of contract action. The circuit court denied the motion, finding that oil company did not comply with the new rule's safe harbor notice provision. The court of appeals affirmed. The oil company appealed. The court reversed because the circuit court and court of appeals erred as a matter of law in holding that new rule had retroactive application without exception. The court held that the new rule was a procedural rule that generally had retroactive application but was not to be applied retroactively when it diminished a contract, disturbed vested rights, or imposed an unreasonable burden. Although the retroactive application of the new rule did not disturb a contract or substantive vested right, the court remanded the case for a determination of whether the retroactive application imposed an unreasonable burden on a party who was to comply with its procedural requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the court of appeals and the order of the circuit court. The court remanded the cause to the circuit court for whether retroactive application of the new rule imposed an unreasonable burden, whether the former or new rules applied, and whether, under the applicable provision and the unreasonable burden standard, the delivery company engaged in frivolous conduct and what sanctions were to be imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case involved a review of the appellate court's decision summarily affirming the dispositional order of the circuit court, terminating the father's parental rights. The circuit court granted the State partial summary judgment at the first step of the termination of parental rights proceedings, the fact-finding phase relating to the grounds for termination. The supreme court reversed and remanded, stating that in determining whether a party seeking termination of parental rights had proven by clear and convincing evidence that a biological father failed to assume parental responsibility under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(6) (2003-04), the circuit court must consider the biological father's efforts after he discovered that he was the father but before the circuit court adjudicated the grounds of the termination proceeding. The circuit court proceeded under an erroneous interpretation of the statute and the facts were not fully developed. To the extent that facts were developed, those facts and their import were in dispute. The parties disputed whether the father had assumed parental responsibility after he learned of his paternity but before adjudication of the grounds for termination.</SPAN></P>

Council 40 AFSCME, 2006 WI 126, 297 Wis. 2d 324, 724 N.W.2d 207, 2006 Wisc. LEXIS 897 (2006).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sheriff sought declaratory relief in an labor-related matter. The Circuit Court for Brown County, Wisconsin, granted a permanent injunction to the sheriff, against defendants, a union that represented employees of a jail. The injunction prevented the union from pursuing any type of action before the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission or seeking injunctive relief. The union appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court also ordered the union to withdraw its prohibited practice complaint filed with the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission. The matter arose as a result of the sheriff's proposal to stop using county employees to prepare meals for the local jail and instead contract with a private food service provider. The issue presented was whether the sheriff's decision fell within the sheriff's constitutional powers, rights, and duties, and was thus not subject to legislative limitations, including a collective bargaining agreement. The supreme court held that the sheriff's hiring and firing of personnel to provide food service was not a &quot;time immemorial&quot; principal and important duty that characterized and distinguished the office of sheriff, and as such, was not within the sheriff's constitutional powers. Rather, the hiring and firing of personnel to provide food service to the county jail fell within the &quot;mundane and commonplace&quot; &quot;internal management and administrative duties&quot; not protected by the constitution. Hiring and firing personnel to provide food to inmates was subject to legislative regulation, including collective bargaining under Wis. Stat. &sect; 111.70 (2003-04).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the judgment of the circuit court, and it remanded the cause to the circuit court to dismiss the sheriff's complaint seeking declaratory relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On different dates in January 2005, defendants traveled to the airport to pick up passengers who had made prior arrangements for pickups by the cab company. After ignoring warnings that they could not accept departing taxi fares from the airport, defendants were issued citations for violating the county ordinance, and received fines of $250. The reviewing court addressed the county's ability to enact an ordinance that prohibited taxis without airport permits from making prearranged pickups of customers, where the same ordinance allowed limousines without permits to make such pickups. The reviewing court held that the county ordinance conflicted with the requirement under Wis. Stat. &sect; 114.14 (2005-2006) that the public have equal access to airport services, and to that extent was invalid and unenforceable. The county had provided nothing in the record to support the claim that allowing taxis without permits to make prearranged pickups would create the problems associated with the open system, even though prearranged service by limousines did not cause such problems. Also, the ordinance did not conflict with Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 133.01, 349.24, and 194.02 (2005-2006).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Appeals (Wisconsin) reversed a judgment of the trial court convicting defendant of operating a motor vehicle with a prohibited alcohol concentration, as a fifth offense. The court of appeals concluded that slight deviations within a single travel lane did not give rise to a reasonable suspicion that a driver was intoxicated. Petitioner State sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State, in essence, asked for a bright-line rule that repeated weaving within a single lane provided the reasonable suspicion necessary to justify a traffic stop. What mattered was whether the vehicle's movements, considered with the totality of the circumstances, gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that defendant was driving while intoxicated. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin determined that weaving within a single traffic lane did not alone give rise to the reasonable suspicion necessary to conduct an investigative stop of a vehicle. However, under the totality of the instant circumstances, the police officer had reasonable suspicion and the stop did not violate defendant's constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The officer's testimony indicated that defendant's weave was between five feet and nine feet, based on his individual estimates of distances and that the vehicle moved laterally ten feet. The incident also took place at 9:30 at night. While that was not as significant as when poor driving took place at or around &quot;bar time,&quot; it did lend some further credence to the suspicion that defendant was driving while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Wisconsin, the successful party at the circuit court and the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), filed a motion to summarily reverse the decision of the court of appeals. The court of appeals granted defendant's petition for review to address whether law enforcement officers could stop an automobile on the sole ground that the automobile had a temporary license plate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question before the court was whether a temporary plate on an automobile, without more, created reasonable suspicion to justify law enforcement's stop of that vehicle. The State's motion for summary reversal conceded, as defendant argued all along, that the decision of the court of appeals conflicted with the holding and rationale of United States Supreme Court case law. Although the State conceded the point of law, the court noted that it, not the parties, decided questions of law. The court stated, however, that it readily accepted the State's concession without further briefing or argument because the State's concession was well-settled law requiring no extensive research or explanation. The Supreme Court opinion at issue stated that except in those situations in which there was at least articulable and reasonable suspicion that a motorist was unlicensed or that an automobile was not registered, or that either the vehicle or an occupant was otherwise subject to seizure for violation of law, stopping an automobile and detaining the driver in order to check his driver's license and the registration of the automobile were unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the motion and remanded the cause to the court of appeals for reconsideration in light of the court's decision and the request of the parties that further proceedings be conducted in the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tribal gambling establishment appealed the decision of the Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin, which granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, the governor and former secretary of administration, and concluded that a 1993 amendment to Wis. Const. art. VI, &sect; 24 did not affect tribal gaming compacts. Plaintiff sought to enjoin defendants from renewing the compacts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2710(d)(3)(c) and Wis. Stat. &sect; 14.035 (2003-04), the State entered into compacts with 11 tribes that permitted the tribes to engage in certain Class III casino gaming. They lasted for seven-year terms, with automatic extensions for five-year terms. The 1993 Amendment limited gaming. The court affirmed and held that the 1993 Amendment's failure to explicitly address the compacts created an ambiguity as to whether the compacts fell within the its reach, and any language in Panzer v. Doyle, 271 Wis. 2d 295, to the contrary was withdrawn. However, because constitutional amendments were presumed to be prospective, it would have been superfluous for the legislature to exempt the compacts. Also, it was shown that the Legislature and the public who voted did not intend the 1993 Amendment to invalidate the compacts. Under the plain terms of the compacts, changes in State law did not impact the compacts, including renewals and extensions. Because the compacts contemplated extending and amending the scope of gaming, the parties' right of renewal was protected by the Contract Clauses of the United States and Wisconsin Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Walworth County (Wisconsin) convicted defendant of two counts of interference with legal custody of a child in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.31(1)(b) (1997-98) and felony bail jumping in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 946.49(1)(b) (1997-98). The Court of Appeals of Wisconsin affirmed. The case was before the court on certification by the court of appeals under Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.61 (2003-04).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for failing to return his children to his ex-wife when his visitation with the children ended. Defendant challenged his conviction as to one of his children, arguing that the child was not legally adopted by his ex-wife because she procured the adoption order by fraud. At the time of the adoption hearing in Missouri, even though defendant and his family lived in Wisconsin, the ex-wife stated that they still lived in Missouri. On appeal, defendant claimed that the circuit court erred by preventing him from collaterally attacking the validity of the custody order. The court held that because the Wisconsin family court had personal jurisdiction over defendant and defendant received adequate notice of the divorce proceedings, there was no jurisdictional fraud, and the custody order was not void. Defendant's ex-wife therefore had legal custody over the child, and evidence of her alleged fraud in the adoption proceedings could not negate an element of interference with custody. Defendant's fraud allegation did not raise an affirmative defense. The circuit court had the authority to impose attorney fees for standby counsel as a condition of defendant's probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were affirmed. The case was remanded to the circuit court to determine whether the full amount of attorney fees should have been imposed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the mother did not waive her right to challenge the constitutionality of Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff surviving spouse appealed a decision of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin) affirming the decision that awards in a wrongful death case against defendant doctor for damages for the decedent's predeath pain, suffering and disability; damages to the spouse for his predeath loss; and damages for the spouse's postdeath loss of his wife's society were collectively limited by the wrongful death cap of Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being treated by the doctor the decedent suffered a heart attack. She was bedridden in a nursing home until her death five years later. The court reversed and held that Maurin v. Hall, 274 Wis. 2d 28, was unsound in principle and was wrongly decided. Maurin erred in conflating a wrongful death and a survival action and subjecting both to the wrongful death cap. Nothing in any of the statutes indicated a legislative intent to conflate noneconomic damages for predeath claims (such as the victim's pain and suffering and a family member's predeath loss of society and companionship) and noneconomic damages for wrongful death claims for postdeath loss of society into a single cause of action or a single statutory cap. The legislature adopted two caps: a medical malpractice cap for noneconomic damages for predeath claims and a wrongful death cap for noneconomic damages for postdeath loss of society and companionship. Furthermore, no cap applied to the noneconomic damages at issue because Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.55(4)(d) had been held unconstitutional. Therefore, the jury's $ 350,000 award for the spouse's postdeath loss of society and companionship was within the wrongful death cap.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 76.08(1) required it to serve defendant state department of revenue (DOR) within 30 days; and the denial of the re-determination claim did not violate its due process right.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff challenged the hub exemption on the grounds that it offered two in-state airlines a competitive advantage. The court reversed and held that 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 40116 showed congressional consent to allow states to impose differential taxes among air carriers. The exemption was limited because &sect; 40116(d)(1)(D) defined &quot;commercial and industrial property&quot; to exclude transportation property and property not subject to a property tax levy. Because the property of the two competitors fit both exceptions to the comparison class, the assessment ratio and tax rate at which their property was taxed were irrelevant. Also, as the exemption did not fall within any of the assessment practices prohibited by the statute, the hub exemption was not subject to dormant Commerce Clause review. Further, since the exemption did not implicate a suspect class or fundamental right, the classifications were upheld as the legislature could have reasonably determined that creating the exemption would help retain air carriers, which would bolster economic development, a legitimate governmental purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners' association challenged the order requiring a reduction in the number of boat slips. The court held that because the DNR did not appeal the decision of the ALJ, and adopted the decision as its own, the decision was entitled to great weight deference, because it was a decision within the DNR's area of expertise. The court found that the ALJ examined environmental impact, natural scenic beauty, historic use, safety, the absence of a permit, and the DNR's delayed enforcement, among other factors, in determining &quot;reasonable use.&quot; The court concluded that there was ample evidence that the ALJ weighed the relevant factors in light of the public trust doctrine. Therefore the court concluded that the DNR's decision to limit the number of boat slips was consistent with applicable law and supported by sufficient evidence that showed the homeowners' association's pier had direct and cumulative adverse impacts to the wildlife and fish habitat, and that the association was entitled to no more than reasonable use, without a permit for its pier.

On appeal, the court held that defendant's statement was voluntary and should be admitted into evidence. Under the two-part test adopted by the court, even though defendant subjectively believed that she would be fired if she elected not to talk to the detectives, that belief was objectively unreasonable because: (1) the detectives did not expressly threaten detective with the loss of her job for choosing to exercise her right to remain silent; (2) there was no state law, ordinance, departmental regulation, or longstanding departmental policy that forced an officer to choose between job loss and self-incrimination; (3) defendant was not in custody during the interview; and (4) defendant was questioned pursuant to a criminal investigation, not a personnel investigation.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court determined that a defendant who requested resentencing due to the circuit court's use of inaccurate information at the sentencing hearing had to show both that the information was inaccurate and that the court actually relied on the inaccurate information in the sentencing. Defendant had to establish that some of the information presented was inaccurate and that the sentencing court actually relied on that misinformation in reaching its determination in regard to the sentence imposed. The State conceded that the information was inaccurate, and the record made clear that the sentencing court specifically considered the inaccurate information in its decision. The issue of harmless error was not developed to the degree necessary to assist the supreme court in resolving that issue, and since the matter should be remanded for resentencing, the supreme court accepted the stipulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patron fractured her right femur in a women's bathroom at the ski resort while exiting a bathroom cubicle. She filed a safe place claim against the ski resort and insurer, which was dismissed on summary judgment. The appellate court affirmed the summary judgment and the supreme court further affirmed. The patron contended that the circuit court erred in applying the 10-year statute of repose in Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.89 (2003-04) to bar her claim brought under the safe place statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 101.11 (2003-04). The supreme court disagreed and concluded that 10 years after a structure was substantially completed, Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.89 barred safe place claims resulting from injuries caused by structural defects, as opposed to safe place claims resulting from injuries caused by unsafe conditions associated with the structure. Because the facts demonstrated that the patron's fall was caused by alleged defects in the location, depth, and slope of the floor drain that existed since the building's construction, her injury was caused by an alleged structural defect and not an unsafe condition associated with the structure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On certification from the court of appeals, appellant State sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Jackson County (Wisconsin), which entered judgment dismissing a complaint that charged defendant with unlawfully carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.23 (2003-04).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a tavern owner who kept a loaded gun in his car, and he was arrested one afternoon as he was in the process of running errands. He moved to dismiss the complaint, asserting that he kept the gun for security purposes because he routinely transported large amounts of cash generated by his business, and the circuit court granted his motion. On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 941.23 was unconstitutional as applied to him because it violated his right, under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 25, to bear arms. In reversing the judgment, the court disagreed, finding that defendant's interest in exercising his right to keep and bear arms in his vehicle for purposes of security did not substantially outweigh the State's interest in enforcing Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.23 (2003-04). The court concluded that the statute was a reasonable exercise of the State's inherent police power in light of its interest in protecting public safety. The court distinguished defendant's case from those involving concealed weapons kept in homes or private businesses, noting, among other things, the danger presented by the transportation of concealed weapons and the increased threat to law enforcement officers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the circuit court's order dismissing the complaint and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

A security guard heard her screams, came upon them and the assailant ran. Both the security guard and the victim identified defendant in a lineup. The court affirmed, and concluded that it was not an erroneous exercise of discretion for the circuit court to deny defendant's motion to admit expert testimony regarding an eyewitness's ability to identify a stranger because the trial court found that the expert would not assist the trier. Also, any error would have been harmless because there was other sufficient evidence support the verdict. The trial court's decision did not deprive defendant of his constitutional right to present a defense. Defendant failed to establish that the expert eyewitness testimony was necessary to his case. Further, the trial court heard all the relevant details of the charged offense from the perspective of the accused, and the exclusion of expert testimony did not preclude him from introducing any factual evidence. Also, the evidence in the record was insufficient to establish that defendant offered to take a polygraph examination, as opposed to agreeing to take one.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The beneficiary was the widow of a university professor. The professor was a Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) participant. The professor died on January 2, 1999, and the beneficiary did not file for the death benefits until November 2000.

Between January 3, 1999 and December 1, 2000, the death benefit was held in the fixed retirement investment trust account, and although interest was earned on the funds in the account, the Department paid no interest on the death benefit when it was paid to the beneficiary on December 1, 2000. The reviewing court ruled that it agreed with the court of appeals that no unconstitutional taking occurred because the beneficiary did not acquire a property interest in a single cash sum death benefit under Wis.

Stat. ch. 980 civil commitment within a meaningful time period. Nevertheless, the supreme court disagreed with the committee's contention that he had to be released from commitment for the due process violation because he remained a sexually violent person, and release of a person who continued to be sexually violent under Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.01(7) contravened the purposes of Wis. Stat. ch. 980 and was not required by the due process clause. The appropriate remedy was to move for a writ of mandamus or a supervisory writ.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed however, stating that the November 2000 order granting the State's motion for reconsideration and finding that the inmate was not appropriate for supervised release, was a valid, final, appealable order, and therefore, he was not entitled to outright release from his Wis. Stat. ch. 980 commitment; he had failed to appeal the order. The court did state that there were other issues to be considered and concluded that there was a procedural due process violation and that circuit courts were allowed to order the Department of Health and Family Services to create an appropriate residential facility or dwelling to accommodate a ch. 980 order for supervised release. However, issuing such an order was unnecessary in the inmate's case because such a residential facility or dwelling for supervised release would have been meaningless for the inmate at the current time because he was determined to be inappropriate for supervised release in November 2000 and that determination had not been changed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Appeals of Wisconsin reversed a circuit court order that allowed a medical malpractice action filed by petitioners, a minor and his parents, to proceed as timely filed. The court of appeals concluded that, even though the minor was a developmentally disabled child, the general three-year statute of limitations for medical malpractice actions, Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.55 (2003-04), applied to bar the action. Petitioners sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals determined that other statutes of limitations applicable to children did not, by their plain language, apply to the minor's medical malpractice action. On review, the issue the court had to decide was what statute of limitations applied to a claim against a health care provider alleging injury to a developmentally disabled child. This issue required the court to interpret and apply Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 893.16, 893.56, and 893.55 (2003-04). The court reversed the decision of the court of appeals, concluding that the legislature had not provided an applicable statute of limitations for a claim against a health care provider alleging injury to a developmentally disabled child. Therefore, the court held that the minor's action was not time-barred. The court stated that this determination was the only determination the court was able to reach without either rewriting the statutes or working an absurd and illogical result. The court noted, however, that even in the absence of a statute of limitations, the common law doctrine of laches may, in appropriate cases, be a bar to such claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the court of appeals was reversed, and the cause was remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

On summary judgment, the Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin, dismissed the first two claims. Later, a jury found in favor of each defendant on the question of excessive force pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Plaintiff sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, plaintiff asserted that the trial court erred by imposing a middle burden of proof, clear and convincing evidence, on the liability questions put to the jury in the special verdict. The Wisconsin Supreme Court noted that the issue of what burden of proof was appropriate in a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action alleging excessive force in state court was a matter of first impression. The supreme court noted that in a typical civil suit for money damages, plaintiffs had to prove their case by a preponderance of the evidence. In excessive force cases arising under &sect; 1983, several federal jurisdictions had approved the preponderance of the evidence standard. Thus, the issue was what burden of proof to apply in state court. The Supremacy Clause imposed on state courts a constitutional duty to proceed in such manner that all the substantial rights of the parties under controlling federal law were protected. The supreme court held that the Supremacy Clause required Wisconsin courts to apply the lowest burden of proof, preponderance of the evidence, in civil rights actions under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, alleging excessive use of force by police personnel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother challenged the sufficiency of the evidence and claimed the trial court erred in excluding her expert's opinion testimony. The court held that the exclusion of the expert's testimony denied the mother her due process rights because the expert was qualified under Wis. Stat. &sect; 907.02; the expert's testimony went to the central issue of whether the mother's parental rights should be terminated under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(2)(a)3 on the ground that she was unable to meet the conditions required for the return of her children; and the mother was unable to present other testimony in her defense. The court noted held that in view of its decision that the trial court erred in excluding the testimony, it did not need to address the mother's claims of insufficient evidence or that the trial court lost competency to hear the termination by failing to meet the time limits imposed by Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.422. The court rejected the mother's claims that the special verdict questions in the termination of parental rights proceedings were functionally equivalent to the grounds under the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), 25 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1901-1963, and required a higher burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the legislature did not intend the contested case provisions of Wis. Stat. ch. 227 to apply to procedures in Wis. Admin. Code &sect; UWS 4. The board promulgated through its rule-making power a complete procedure to be employed before a tenured faculty member could be terminated. Therefore, the provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 36.13(5) and Wis. Admin. Code &sect; UWS 4, which were expressly authorized by law, set out the pre-termination procedures to which plaintiff was due. In determining whether plaintiff showed that three alleged ex parte communications created an impermissibly high probability of actual bias, the court found that communication between the chancellor and a regent were not impermissible. However, the court did not have enough information about what occurred in a closed meeting under &sect; UWS 4.08(2) to determine whether plaintiff's due process rights were violated, so remand was necessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which affirmed the circuit court's decision in a civil forfeiture case. The question was whether Wis. Stat. &sect; 345.43 (2001-02), which mandated six-person juries in civil forfeiture trials, was unconstitutional in respondent county's prosecution of appellant for speeding pursuant to Dane County, Wis., Ordinance &sect; 69.01 and Wis.

Respondent county amended the citation to 25 MPH, which subjected appellant to a potential suspension of his license. The court held that causes of action under traffic laws that were in effect at the time the Wisconsin Constitution took effect were not akin to the current speeding violation. Further, although &quot;speeding&quot; was not a cause of action recognized at common law in 1848, other traffic violations such as driving outside one's lane could not be so easily distinguished, and the court held that it made little sense to scrutinize whether each individual traffic violation was recognized at common law so as to determine whether a violator was entitled to a six- or 12-person jury. Thus appellant did not satisfy the heavy burden of showing that Wis. Stat. &sect; 345.43 was unconstitutional. Because he cannot show that the cause of action for a speeding violation existed at the time the Wisconsin Constitution was enacted, he has no constitutional right to a trial by a jury of 12.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff minor, by his guardian ad litem, sought review of a decision of the court of appeals (Wisconsin) that declined to extend the risk-contribution announced in Collins in the minor's action against defendant pigment manufacturers for injuries he received from lead paint in his prior residences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor had cognitive deficits as a result of lead poisoning. The court of appeals concluded that because the minor had a remedy against his landlords, there was no reason to extend the risk-contribution theory. The minor was unable to identify the precise producer of the white lead carbonate pigment he ingested due to the generic nature of the pigment. The court reversed in part and extended the Collins' risk-contribution theory to white lead carbonate claims. Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 applied not only when a plaintiff was without a remedy; rather, it allowed a court to fashion an adequate remedy when one did not exist. There was no dispute that the minor was an innocent plaintiff who would be forced to bear a significant cost of his injuries if not allowed to sue the possibly negligent manufacturers, and it was clear that the manufacturers contributed to the risk of injury to the minor. Also, the factual circumstances of physical interchangeability that were present were sufficiently similar to remain within Collins' confines in that white lead carbonates were produced utilizing virtually identical chemical formulas such that all white lead carbonates were identically defective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed as to the negligence claims against the manufacturers and affirmed as to the dismissal of the civil conspiracy and enterprise liability claims. The court also held that the manufacturers' constitutional challenges to the conclusion were not ripe.</SPAN></P>

However, if evidence of collateral source payments from sources including Medicare, other state or federal government programs, medical insurance or write-offs, and discounted or free medical services was presented to the fact-finder, then the parties must be allowed to furnish the jury with evidence of any obligations of subrogation or reimbursement.

The supreme court agreed. There existed sufficient facts at the time of defendant's arrest to establish probable cause for his arrest. It was not necessary for the police to conduct the showups. The officers handcuffed defendant and placed him in the back seat of a squad car. By placing defendant in a squad car, the police implicitly suggested that they believed that he was the offender. Police told the witness that they might have caught &quot;one of the guys&quot; who had robbed him. Such a comment was suggestive and greatly increased the chance of misidentification. After the first showup was conducted and defendant was positively identified, the police still conducted two more identification procedures, another showup and a photo of defendant, at the police station. Those subsequent identification procedures were unnecessarily suggestive. Defendant had already been arrested and positively identified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury verdict in favor of appellant individual, respondent Wisconsin Patients Compensation Fund moved to have the noneconomic damages reduced pursuant to the limitation established in Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 655.017 and 893.55(4)(d) (2001-02). The trial court granted the motion, and the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin affirmed. The individual sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual sustained permanent injuries as an infant due to a doctor's malpractice. The jury awarded the individual $ 700,000 in noneconomic damages for injuries caused by medical malpractice and $ 403,000 for future medical expenses based on his life expectancy of 69 years. The Fund moved to have the noneconomic damages reduced pursuant to the $350,000 limitation established in &sect;&sect; 655.017 and 893.55(4)(d). The individual claimed that &sect;&sect; 655.017 and 893.55(4)(d) were unconstitutional in that, inter alia, they violated the equal protection guarantees of Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The state supreme court agreed with the individual and held that &sect;&sect; 655.017 and 893.55(4)(d) were unconstitutional. The state supreme court applied a rational basis level of scrutiny and found that the legislature's goals of wanting to adequately compensate malpractice victims, limit malpractice premiums, and keep the Fund's assessment level at a low rate were not rationally related to the cap as the cap punished the most severely injured victims and the facts did not support the assumption that a cap on noneconomic damages achieved any of the other stated goals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the court of appeals was reversed, and the cause was remanded to the trial court to determine (1) if the Fund was liable for payment of the amount of the jury award in excess of the statutory limitation and (2) the constitutionality of other statutes and rules that required awards in excess of $100,000 to be deposited in an account over which the Fund had control.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court refused to allow those entrusted to enforce the law to intentionally subvert a suspect's constitutional rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged that the company controlled up to 95 percent of the market for personal computer operating systems that were compatible with a commonly-used microprocessor, and that it engaged in various forms of anticompetitive conduct to maintain its monopoly. The company noted that it was a foreign corporation and that most of the conduct complained of occurred outside Wisconsin and affected interstate commerce. The trial court dismissed the suit because it found that Wis. Stat. ch. 133 applied only to intrastate commerce. The high court disagreed. Reviewing the statutory history, it held that Wis. Stat. ch. 133 could reach interstate commerce if (1) actionable conduct occurred within Wisconsin, even if its effects were felt primarily elsewhere; or (2) the conduct &quot;substantially affected&quot; Wisconsinites and had impacts in Wisconsin, even if the illegal activity resulting in those impacts occurred predominantly or exclusively outside Wisconsin. The high court withdrew the language from Conley Publ'g Group v. Journal Communications, 2003 WI 119, 265 Wis. 2d 128, 665 N.W.2d 879, that the scope of Wis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child received counseling and told her therapist that her grandfather sexually assaulted her. The clinical director reported the sexual assault to the authorities. The mother overheard the child tell the therapist that the grandfather did not sexually assault her; the mother relayed that information to her grandmother. The circuit court conducted an in-camera review of the counseling records to look for any information that either inculpated or exculpated the grandfather and found nothing. At issue in the case was whether the circuit court could conduct an in camera interview of the therapist. The appellate court concluded that the mother waived the privilege, but the supreme court affirmed on other grounds pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 48.981 and 905.04 (2001-02). It concluded that there was no privilege because an examination of the child created a reasonable ground for an opinion that she was abused and that her abuse was other than accidentally caused or inflicted by another.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An incompetent woman (ward) lived in a nursing home in an Illinois county, and her sister was her guardian. Because many of the ward's relatives wanted her moved to Wisconsin, the department petitioned for protective placement at a private nursing home in Wisconsin and nominated the sister to remain as her guardian. The circuit court dismissed the petition based upon the ward's non-residency, and the court of appeals determined that Wis. Stat. &sect; 55.06(3)(c), as applied to the ward, violated her constitutional right to interstate travel. In applying national probate court standards, the court held that the principles of comity were to be applied here. The court therefore remanded and held that the department should petition the Illinois county court where the ward resided for transfer of the guardianship and likewise petition the trial court in the department's county for the receipt and acceptance of the ward's guardianship. If these steps were completed, the court in circuit court would be able to place the ward at the private Wisconsin nursing home without hearing a new petition for protective placement. This would avoid the residency requirement of &sect; 55.06(3)(c).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that his written confession to the police was involuntary under the totality of the circumstances. The supreme court agreed. Defendant's young age of 14 was a strong factor weighing against the voluntariness of his confession. His limited education and low average intelligence were additional reasons for why he was susceptible to police pressure. Defendant had been arrested twice for misdemeanor offenses prior to his interrogation for the armed robbery. In both instances, he answered police questions, admitted to involvement, and was allowed to go home. The police specifically denied defendant's requests to call his parents. Not only did the detectives refuse to believe defendant's repeated denials of guilt, but they also joined in urging him to tell a different &quot;truth,&quot; sometimes using a &quot;strong voice&quot; that &quot;frightened&quot; him. Therefore, the written confession was involuntary under the totality of the circumstances. In addition, the supreme court exercised its supervisory power to require that all custodial interrogation of juveniles be electronically recorded where feasible, and without exception when questioning occurred at a place of detention.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner challenged a decision of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin) that he was procedurally barred from bringing a claim challenging the constitutionality of Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner had been convicted of numerous sex-related offenses, and after having his parole revoked he was found sexually violent and was committed under ch. 980. Petitioner sought release under Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.09(2) (2001-02), which was denied. The court concluded that because petitioner facially challenged the constitutionality of ch. 980, his challenge went to the subject matter jurisdiction of the court, and thus jurisdiction could not be waived. The court held that the evidence supported a determination that petitioner remained dangerous. Although he was granted parole, it was not a conclusive determination of his dangerousness under ch. 980. Also, due process did not require adoption of a bright-line rule that petitioner had committed a recent overt act while on parole. The question was simply whether it was substantially probable that the person would engage in acts of sexual violence. The fact that petitioner was incarcerated for attempted sexual assault when the petition was filed, while not sufficient evidence for commitment under Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.05(4) (2001-02), was a proper component of the evaluation of his current dangerousness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner bleacher manufacturer appealed the decision of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin) reversing the circuit court's summary judgment for the manufacturer under Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.89 in a personal injury action alleging that school bleachers were in a dangerously defective condition when they left the control of the manufacturer and that the product caused harm to respondents, a child who fell through them, and her family.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school purchased the bleachers from the manufacturer in 1969. The issues were whether the bleachers constituted an improvement to real property for purposes of &sect; 893.89 and whether &sect; 893.89 violated the right to remedy provision of Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 or equal protection rights. The court held that the bleachers constituted a permanent addition to the school in that, while they could be disassembled and moved, it would require a significant amount of time and effort. Under Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.89(2), the manufacturer's liability exposure ended 10 years after the substantial completion to the improvement of real property, and thus &sect; 893.89 did not violate Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 because art. I, &sect; 9 guaranteed a remedy only for existing rights. Finally, the court concluded that Wis. Stat &sect; 893.89 did not violate the guarantee of equal protection in the federal and state constitutions because it was not patently arbitrary or bore a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest because the classifications within &sect; 893.89 rationally served the legitimate purpose of limiting the long-term liability of those involved in the improvement of real property.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was told that he was not under arrest, yet he was placed in a police vehicle, where he made a statement. At issue was whether the unlawfully obtained statement induced defendant to take the stand to reduce the impact of the statement. The supreme court held that the State's underlying constitutional violation of defendant's right to counsel and the circuit court's error in not suppressing the tape-recorded statement was not harmless. The State had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant did not take the stand in order to overcome the impact of the illegally obtained and improperly introduced statement. Even if defendant would have taken the stand in the absence of the illegally obtained confession, the State did not meet its burden in dispelling the natural inference that no testimonial admission so damaging would have been made if the prosecutor had not already spread defendant's confession before the jury. The State failed to show that defendant's testimony was obtained by means sufficiently distinguishable from the underlying illegality to be purged of the primary taint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insureds, who sought additional recovery from two underinsured motorist provisions, moved for relief from all judgments, orders, releases, and stipulations pursuant to Wis.

The instant court agreed, holding that the circuit court correctly determined that there had been no change in the law in regard to the enforceability of reducing clauses at issue in this case. Because a change in the law was the basis for the insureds' motion, the circuit court appropriately exercised its discretion in denying the insureds relief from judgment. In addressing the insureds' motion, the circuit court properly identified the equitable balance it was to apply when deciding a motion under &sect; 806.07(1)(h). When the circuit court weighed its conclusion that the law was unchanged against the finality of judgments, it held that insureds' motion had to be denied. This showed the circuit court used a rational reasoning process based on an application of the correct legal standard to the facts of record and came to a conclusion a reasonable court could make. The appellate court did not review the circuit court's decision under the erroneous exercise of discretion standard, but instead substituted its own judgment for that of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin) that reversed defendant's conviction for homicide by intoxicated operation of a vehicle under Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.09 (2001-02), due to a boating accident resulting in the death of one of his friends. The conviction was reversed based on the conclusion that a jury instruction on chemical tests for intoxication and defendant's prohibited alcohol concentration (PAC) was misleading.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that its jury instruction properly explained the law regarding chemical tests for intoxication under Wis. Stat. &sect; 885.235 (2001-02) and did not deprive defendant of due process. The State had submitted a proposed instruction that allowed the jury to find that defendant had a PAC of 0.1 or higher at the time of his operation of the boat as prima facie evidence that he was under the influence of an intoxicant at that time. The court reversed the court of appeals judgment. The court held that the jury instruction satisfied the requirements of &sect; 885.235(3) because the State presented expert testimony regarding the effect that the delayed drawing of defendant's blood and test results had upon defendant's PAC at the time of the accident.  The court held that there was sufficient evidence to show defendant was operating the boat at the time of the accident based on his statements to police that he thought the boat was not in gear. The court rejected defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and found that the trial court had properly examined the jury to avoid prejudice from pretrial publicity. The court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.09 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the court of appeals judgment and remanded the case with directions to reinstate defendant's conviction for homicide by intoxicated operation of a vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of causing great bodily harm by operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant under Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.25(1)(a) (1999-2000). The State appealed orders of the Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin, granting defendant's petition for sentence adjustment under Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.195 (2003-04) and denying the State's motion for reconsideration. The case was before the court on a motion to bypass.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of seven and one-half years. The circuit court granted defendant's petition for early release over the State's objection. The State appealed, arguing that Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.195 (2003-04) applied only to crimes committed after February 1, 2003--crimes governed by Truth-in-Sentencing-II. The majority of the court, who provided the concurring and dissenting opinions, held that in order to save the constitutionally of &sect; 973.195, &quot;shall&quot; should be interpreted as directory, thereby giving a circuit court discretion to accept or reject an objection from a district attorney on a petition for sentence adjustment under &sect; 973.195. The court declared unconstitutional the lead opinion's interpretation of &sect; 973.195 to grant a district attorney a veto power over a petition for sentence adjustment. The court held that judicial power was compromised when a district attorney was given the unilateral power to end a circuit court's consideration of an inmate's petition for sentence adjustment; a district attorney's exercise of a core judicial function was barred by the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The orders were reversed and the case was remanded to the circuit court to exercise its discretion whether to grant defendant's petition for sentence adjustment, giving full consideration of the factors set forth in the concurring opinion, including the nature of the crime, the character of defendant, the protection of the public positions of the State and the victim, and other relevant factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner County Department of Human Services brought a petition to terminate the parental rights of respondent father to seven minor children pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(4). The father entered a no contest plea, and the trial court entered an order terminating parental rights. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In terminating the father's parental rights, the trial court adopted the conclusions of a social worker's report that the children had been subject to extreme physical abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect. The father argued that Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.424(4) was facially unconstitutional because it provided that a finding under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(4) was sufficient to prove that a parent was unfit; he claimed that parental rights could therefore be terminated without a finding of unfitness in violation of substantive due process. The supreme court disagreed. The findings that were required for a court to proceed against a parent at each of the steps prior to the final step under &sect; 48.415(4) involved an evaluation of parental fitness, and the cumulative effect of those determinations caused the finding under &sect; 48.415(4) to amount to unfitness. As the father had multiple opportunities to contest the determinations made at each fact-finding stage and chose not to do so, but instead pled no contest to the allegation that &sect; 48.415(4) provided a ground for terminating his parental rights, the record supported the conclusion that he was an unfit parent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff estate administrators brought a suit against defendant general contractor claiming that its negligence caused the death of three construction workers in a crane accident. A jury found in favor of the estates and returned, inter alia, a punitive damage award of $ 94 million. The Court of Appeals of Wisconsin reversed the judgment on punitive damages based on its interpretation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.85(3) (1999-2000). The estates appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three questions of law were presented for review. The supreme court held that the court of appeals had erroneously interpreted &sect; 895.85(3) as requiring intent. Section 895.85(3) required a plaintiff to show that a defendant acted maliciously to the plaintiff or intentionally disregarded the rights of the plaintiff, not that a defendant intended to cause harm or injury to the plaintiff. The evidence was sufficient to have submitted the punitive damages award to the jury which could have believed that the crane collapsed because it was used in high winds, no wind-speed calculations were made, and the crane's load chart limitations were exceeded. Without wind calculations the 45-stories-high crane was lifting a billboard-size load of nearly one million pounds on a windy afternoon. A reasonable jury could have found that the estates had proven by clear and convincing evidence that the contractor had acted in intentional disregard of the rights of the workers, in that it was aware that its conduct was substantially certain to result in their rights being disregarded. The supreme court declined to reach the constitutionality of the amount of the punitive damages award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the court of appeals that reversed the judgment of the circuit court awarding punitive damages was reversed and the cause was remanded to the court of appeals for resolution of the remaining unresolved issues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2001, respondent mother filed a petition for an order to show cause, alleging that appellant father violated a 1982 child support order. The circuit court ruled against the father, concluding that application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel was inappropriate under Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.32(1r) (2000-2001) and that the statute was constitutional. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed. The father filed a petition for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued it violated his right to due process under the state and federal constitutions to retroactively apply Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.32(1m), (1r) (2000-2001), which were amended in 1997, instead of the law that was in place at the time the parties entered into a stipulation that formed the basis of the 1982 child support order. The instant court concluded that retroactive applications of &sect; 767.32(1m), (1r), were rational and did not violate the father's right to due process. Although the total amount the father would have to pay in order to satisfy the child support arrearages, plus interest, was considerable, his private interest in property was weak. The father's obligation to pay child support was explicit in the 1982 support order. The statute provided the father the opportunity to return to court and request a modification of the order. He chose not to do so. Instead, the father waited until he was called into court to pay the arrearages. The instant court, which balanced the public's interest against the father's private interest, weighed the public interest as more substantial.</SPAN></P>

In light of his egregious pattern of misconduct, the supreme court found it appropriate to require the attorney to pay the full costs of the disciplinary proceeding. Pursuant to Wis. Sup. Ct. R. 22.24, the supreme court could assess all of the costs against the attorney in which misconduct had been found. The fees and expenses incurred by the Office of Lawyer Regulation, as itemized in its statement of costs submitted to the supreme court, were reasonable and fully documented. The attorney, as a repeat violator of the supreme court rules, was ordered to pay all of the costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a medical malpractice and wrongful death suit arising from the death of a 5-year-old child, a jury awarded $ 2,500,000 for loss of society and companionship to plaintiff parents. The circuit court made a postjudgment ruling that the wrongful death cap on noneconomic damages was unconstitutional. Defendant doctor appealed, and the appeals court, Wisconsin, certified questions as to the interplay and constitutionality of relevant caps.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first addressed what limits applied to noneconomic damages in derivative wrongful death claims resulting from medical malpractice and found that such claims were covered by the medical malpractice limitations outlined in Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.55(4) (1995-96). The amount of the cap was determined by whether the patient survived. When the patient survived, the cap was in Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.55(4)(d). When the patient died, the cap was contained in Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.04(4), which applied in lieu of, not in addition to, the medical malpractice cap. For claims arising between May 25, 1995, and April 27, 1998, two parents were entitled to separate awards of $ 150,000, resulting in a $ 300,000 cap. The limit on wrongful death noneconomic damages arising out of medical malpractice was constitutional. By limiting damages, the legislature did not trample on the jury's role in assessing damages or the court's powers of remittitur and additur. The cap was rationally related to the legitimate legislative objective of assuaging the fear that passions would run high, resulting in huge damage awards. Adjustments to the cap did not lead inexorably to the conclusion that changes were arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court and remanded the cause for action consistent with the decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with operating while intoxicated, Wis.

The circuit court granted his motion to suppress the results of the warrantless blood test because defendant had given a voluntary breath test and thus exigent circumstances did not exist.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court held that, under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 and U.S. Const. amend. IV, exigent circumstances justifying defendant's warrantless and nonconsensual blood draw no longer existed after he gave a satisfactory, useable chemical test. The court reversed, finding that one presumptively valid chemical breath sample did not extinguish the exigent circumstances. The nature of the evidence sought, specifically the rapid dissipation of alcohol from the bloodstream, determined the exigency, not the existence of other evidence. The blood test also satisfied the Bohling test of reasonableness. A preliminary breath test indicated an alcohol concentration of 0.13, but was not admissible to prove the level of intoxication. A later chemical breath sample indicted an alcohol concentration of 0.09, which was sufficient if both of defendant's previous alcohol-related driving convictions were admitted. However, if either were inadmissible, the State would have to prove an alcohol concentration of 0.1 or higher, Wis. Stat. &sect; 885.235(1g)(c). Given the strong state interest in removing drunk drivers from the roadways, the court could not say that the blood draw was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Appeals (Wisconsin) affirmed a judgment declaring petitioner to be a sexually violent person and committing him under Wis. Stat. ch. 980 (1999-2000). Petitioner appealed on ineffective assistance of counsel grounds, asserting that his Fifth Amendment rights were violated because respondent State used, at trial, statements petitioner made to a state psychologist during the pre-petition psychological evaluation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With respect to the issue involving petitioner's alleged Fifth Amendment violation, the lower appellate court concluded that petitioner was not entitled to a Miranda warning before being evaluated by a state psychologist, because any statements petitioner made about his past crimes could not subject him to future prosecution. As the lower appellate court concluded that a Miranda warning was not required, it held that petitioner did not suffer any prejudice as a result of his counsel's failure to object to the psychologist's testimony and report. On further appeal, the court concluded that petitioner was not entitled to Miranda warnings prior to his pre-petition evaluation. Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.05(1m) (1999-2000) plainly contained the language &quot;at the trial.&quot; The plain language of the statute led to the conclusion that the legislature intended that the constitutional rights available to a defendant in a criminal proceeding would apply at petitioner's ch. 980 trial. Thus, petitioner did not have the right to Miranda warnings during his pre-petition interview. Because petitioner was not entitled to the warnings, the court concluded that counsel's performance was not deficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offender was convicted of a sex crime. Shortly before his release date, a court found that the offender was a sexually violent person. He was placed in a halfway house, and he was ordered to abide by certain rules. A revocation was sought based on the fact that the offender left the residence to have sexual intercourse with a married woman, he obtained a prescription for a drug that treated erectile dysfunction, he consumed alcohol, and he refused to participate in treatment. The offender sought review after his revocation was upheld by the court of appeals. In affirming, the court determined that a sexually violent person on supervised release under Wis. Stat. ch. 980 was not entitled to a due process right to have a trial court consider and reject alternatives before revoking supervised release. This was especially true when the court determined that the safety of others required a revocation under Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.06(d)(2) (1997-98). Further, there was no constitutional &quot;unfairness&quot; in the revocation proceedings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant faced prosecution on one count of sexual intercourse with a person who had not yet attained the age of 16 years contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.02 (1999-2000). The circuit court granted the defendant's motion to introduce evidence of the victim's intentional misrepresentation of her age and the appellate court certified two questions to the supreme court. First, was a minor sexual assault victim's intentional misrepresentation of his or her age a defense to a charge brought under &sect; 948.02(2)? The supreme court held that &sect; 948.02(2), read with Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 939.23 and 939.43(2) (1999-2000), precluded a defense predicated on a child's intentional misrepresentation of her age. The second certified question was whether or not the statutes denied defendant his constitutional rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Because the legislature's forbidding a reasonable mistake of age defense in statutory rape cases had a significant historical derivation and is widespread, and because of judicial deference to the legislature's discretion, it was not violative of due process for the State legislature to forbid a defense of fraud or reasonable mistake about the age of the victim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter was before the court on certification from the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The LTSB Director claimed that the confidentiality requirement of Wis.

The court held that the confidentiality requirement of Wis. Stat. &sect; 13.96 prevented voluntary disclosure to one who did not have proper authorization to receive the stored data, but it was insufficient to excuse noncompliance with a valid John Doe subpoena. The court also held that if Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16 applied to the LTSB communications, it provided only use immunity, not the right to keep all legislative communications secret. The court concluded that neither the separation of powers doctrine nor Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8 provided an absolute defense to the compulsion of a John Doe subpoena. However, the court found that the subpoena contained no specificity as to subject matter or time, thus it was overly broad. The court quashed the subpoena, with directions that the attorney general comply with particularity and probable cause requirements to produce a constitutionally sufficient subpoena.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a police investigation, the employee admitted to using drugs. After the board recommended termination, the employee was fired. He then sought review of the board's order in two parallel actions. One was an action under Wis. Stat. &sect; 62.13(5)(i) (amended 1993). The second action was a review of his termination pursuant to a petition for a writ of certiorari. The circuit court determined that the employee's termination was supported by just cause. Thereafter, it dismissed the certiorari action. The employee then sought review. In reversing, the court determined that the amended version of &sect; 62.13(5)(i) was not the exclusive remedy for a claim that the rules a subordinate was found to have violated were unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. These issues of law, even if somewhat overlapping with the issues in a proceeding brought under &sect; 62.13(5)(i), could have been considered under certiorari because they concerned whether or not the board kept within its jurisdiction and proceeded on a correct theory of law. Finally, the court held that issue preclusion did not apply with respect to certiorari proceedings subsequent to a &sect; 62.13(5)(i) appeal, despite the overlapping issues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, an employer and his wife, sought review from an order of the Court of Appeals (Wisconsin), which declined to issue a supervisory writ against a criminal complaint that was privately filed by respondent employee, accusing petitioners of stealing funds earmarked for her retirement account. A criminal complaint had been authorized pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 968.02(3) (2001-02), and reconsideration was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, an attorney, complained to the police department and the district attorney (DA) about petitioners' alleged theft, and she was informed that she could proceed in whatever manner she believed necessary. Her motion for issuance of a criminal complaint as to four felony theft counts was granted pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 968.02(3). The trial court denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration, based on their claim that there was no showing that the DA had &quot;refused&quot; to issue the complaint. The court of appeals denied their request for a supervisory writ, and they sought further review. The court found that petitioners had no standing to seek reconsideration under &sect; 968.02(3), as the statute directed an ex parte proceeding and no cross-examination. The court found that issuance of a supervisory writ under Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.51(1) (2001-02) was properly denied, as there was no showing of a violation of a plain duty by the judge. After a lengthy discussion on statutory interpretation, the court found that &quot;refuses&quot; was to be interpreted by its plain dictionary definition and that an explicit refusal was not necessary prior to a judge's authorization of a private complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners contended that the governor exceeded his authority in 2003 when he agreed to certain amendments to the gaming compact that the State had entered into with the Tribe, which was a federally recognized Indian tribe indigenous to Wisconsin. The supreme court held that the governor exceeded his authority when he agreed unilaterally to a compact term that permanently removed the subject of Indian gaming from the legislature's ability to establish policy and make law. The gaming compact was projected to generate additional revenue for the State at a time when additional revenue was needed. Further, the governor acted contrary to the public policy embodied in State law and therefore acted without authority by agreeing to allow the Tribe to conduct new games that were prohibited by Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 24 and by Wisconsin's criminal statutes. Finally, the supreme court concluded that the governor exceeded his authority by agreeing to waive the State's sovereign immunity, an act which he had no inherent or delegated power to undertake.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 48.415(7) (2001-02) could not be constitutionally applied to the mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother was a victim of long-term, continuous incest by her father, who sired her three children. The father was convicted for his criminal actions and he agreed to terminate his parental rights. When the mother was arrested on unrelated charges, the department took the children into custody, and thereafter sought to terminate the mother's rights. The trial court found the mother was an unfit parent under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.424(4) (2001-02) on the ground of incestuous parenthood pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(7). The appellate court reversed, holding that &sect; 48.415(7) violated the mother's substantive due process rights because it was not narrowly tailored to advance the compelling state interests of protecting children from unfit parents, did not promote deterrence, and did not protect children from the psychological harm of being raised in an incestuous family. On appeal, the court noted that the mother had a fundamental liberty interest in parenting her children. It found that &sect; 48.415(7) violated her substantive due process rights by rendering her unfit per se based solely on her status as an incest victim. It also impaired the public policy of protecting crime victims.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that the DNR had express authority under &sect; 29.014(1) to adopt Wis. Admin.

The court affirmed, finding that the bylaws were a contract and that the hospital reasonably interpreted the words &quot;legal counsel&quot; to refer to an attorney licensed in Wisconsin. To construe the words otherwise could permit attorneys unlicensed in Wisconsin or non-attorneys to violate Wis. Stat. &sect; 757.30 (2001-02). It was reasonable to anticipate that the lawyer would be engaging in activities that would focus on legal issues. The court declined to construct an interpretation, or create an exception, to &sect; 757.30 that would permit an attorney unlicensed in Wisconsin to represent the doctor at his peer review hearing. Finally, the lawyer could not be admitted pro hac vice under Wis. Sup. Ct. R. 10.03(4) (2002), which required that a proceeding be before the judge permitting the nonresident representation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the first question, the court did not answer as to all peer review hearings, but held as a matter of contract that the words &quot;legal counsel&quot; applied only to an attorney licensed to practice law in Wisconsin. On the second question, the court declined to create a statutory exception. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners sought a zoning variance for their Washington County property. Defendant Washington County Board of Adjustment considered their variance application at a public hearing and then denied the variance. The property owners sought review via certiorari in a circuit court, which affirmed the denial. The Court of Appeals (Wisconsin) affirmed. The property owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The variance application was denied, and the denial was upheld on certiorari review and appeal for the sole reason that Kenosha County's strict &quot;no reasonable use of the property&quot; standard for determining unnecessary hardship had not been met. The appellate court had now concluded that the &quot;no reasonable use&quot; standard was no longer applicable in area variance cases and reaffirmed the Snyder definition of unnecessary hardship for area variance cases: whether compliance with area zoning restrictions would unreasonably prevent the owner from using the property for a permitted purpose or would render conformity with such restrictions unnecessarily burdensome. Whether this standard was met in this case would depend on the Board's consideration of the purpose of the zoning restriction in question (including the important public purposes of shoreland zoning generally), the effect of the restriction on the property, and the effect of a variance on the neighborhood and the larger public interest. In addition, the property owners would have to demonstrate that the hardship was based upon conditions unique to the property and was not self-created.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a challenger to the outcome of a referendum, appealed the result of a recount that upheld a tie and resulting defeat of the referendum. A circuit court found in favor of the challenger, in part by denying a motion to intervene by a third party, a proponent of the outcome. The Court of Appeals, Wisconsin, allowed the proponent to intervene and held that a &quot;no&quot; vote had been improperly disqualified. The challenger sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the recount of a referendum on funding school improvements, respondent board of canvassers disqualified a &quot;no&quot; vote, because the mark had been erased. The board believed that the vote therefore should not be counted under Wis. Stat. &sect; 7.50(2)(c) (1999-2000), which provided that a ballot be counted so far as the electors' intent could be ascertained. The proponent of the result questioned the board's assessment that the mark had been erased, and the appeals court agreed that the ballot should have been counted. In affirming, the court reasoned that the board's determination was one of law, as it involved the interpretation and application of the statute, and that the board erred in its application of &sect; 7.50(2)(c). On the ballot in question, to the right of the word &quot;no,&quot; there was a clearly visible slash mark written in pencil. The court thus found that there was a qualifying mark in a qualifying place on the ballot at issue. Section 7.50(2)(c) applied, and required the ballot to be counted, because the intent of the voter was readily ascertainable. The court also held that a decision should be rendered, regardless of whether the matter was mooted by a subsequent referendum.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the court of appeals' decision and held that the &quot;no&quot; vote should be counted, that therefore the referendum resulted in a tie vote, and that the question of funding for school improvements was defeated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court placed defendant on supervised release, but thereafter granted the district attorney's motion for reconsideration and ordered defendant committed to an institutional setting. The trial court denied defendant's motion for reconsideration, and he appealed. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's order, concluding that Wis. Stat. &sect; 806.07(l)(h) (1999-2000) was satisfied. Defendant sought further review, and the court found that Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.08(6m) (1999-2000) was the proper vehicle for changing defendant's supervised release status. It was noted that a determination had been made that defendant was an appropriate candidate for supervised release, but he remained institutionalized awaiting placement. The court found that the issue came within exceptions to the mootness doctrine, in that it was an issue of great public importance, recurred with some frequency, and was likely to arise again. The court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 806.07(1) was improperly applied to the facts, as Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.08(6m) was better suited for granting the relief sought, regardless of whether the defendant had actually been placed on supervised release.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for murder. The trial court granted in part and denied in part defendant's motions to suppress evidence. Both the State and defendant appealed. The Court of Appeals of Wisconsin certified the following question: Should physical evidence obtained as the direct result of a Miranda violation be suppressed when the violation was an intentional attempt to prevent the suspect from exercising his Fifth Amendment rights?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for a parole violation the day after the victim was killed. When the police went to arrest him, without giving a Miranda warning, the police asked defendant what clothes he had been wearing the night before. Defendant pointed to a pile of clothes on the floor, and a sweatshirt contained the victim's blood on one sleeve. The questioning by the police continued at the station without any Miranda warnings. Other evidence was seized when defendant's brother allowed the police to search his house and the room defendant rented. The state supreme court: (1) affirmed the suppression of the sweatshirt, as its discovery was the direct result of an intentional Miranda violation and overruled State v. Yang, 2000 WI App 63, 233 Wis. 2d 545, 608 N.W.2d 703; (2) affirmed the suppression of the statements given to the police, as defendant had not been advised of his rights, but also allowed the statements to be used for impeachment purposes; (3) held that defendant's brother had apparent authority to give consent to the police to search defendant's room in the brother's house; and (4) affirmed the decision to admit hearsay evidence used to implicate a third party suspect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court's of appeals' question was answered in the affirmative, and the grant of the motion to suppress the evidence seized as a result of the violation was affirmed. The court reversed the trial court's grant of the motion to suppress evidence seized from defendant's apartment. The court affirmed the suppression of defendant's statements, except for their use during cross-examination of defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the court of appeals erred in denying a new trial because the cumulative effect of counsel's deficiencies prejudiced defendant to the extent that it undermined confidence in the trial's outcome. The court concluded that the representation was constitutionally inadequate because counsel failed to read all discovery materials, which contained a medical report that the complainant was enraged at defendant for refusing to support her disability claim; investigate her credibility by interviewing neighbors who never saw her at defendant's house and discover that she had difficulty locating the house and did not have a driver's license; failed to prevent the admission of a prior consistent statement; and misunderstood Wis.
